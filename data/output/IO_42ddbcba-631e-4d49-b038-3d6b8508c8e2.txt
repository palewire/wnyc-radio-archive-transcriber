UNYC now brings you a special program in celebration of Finland's Independence Day. Our program this evening will feature music by Finnish composers well known in their native land, though unfamiliar to most of us. Before we begin the musical portion of our program, we wish to tell our listeners that by special arrangement, this program is being recorded and will be flown to Finland, where it will be rebroadcast through the facilities of the Finnish broadcasting system. The music of Jan Sibelius has become as familiar to American audiences as it is to the people of Finland. His seven symphonies are part of the standard repertory of major orchestral associations in every part of the world. His long-awaited Eighth Symphony is to have its American premiere this season. Serge Krzyzewicki, an ardent champion of contemporary music, will conduct the new work in Symphony Hall in Boston. We hear first the Kuliki Suite for piano as performed by Edward Weiss. When Mr. Weiss toured Europe, he visited Helsinki, where he met Sibelius, who presented him with his complete works for piano. The Kuliki Suite was among them. Now, Edward Weiss performing the Kuliki Suite by Jan Sibelius.
