It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the Chief Executive of the City wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me, since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. May your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scarni of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. and Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Thank you. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it's with profound commotion that I've heard your words affectionate and cordiales revolting to my modest person and to my noble city that I've been here to represent. There is a an O-N Geez She is also a member of the city of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the people so close to the land of America, but she, on the other hand, is also been sent to the people of America as a member of the democracy, that is so dear to the people of the United States, but so dear to the Italians and the genoveses especially. For this, on the other hand, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, so that every citizen of America, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come to the city's high level representative. So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, on the impenitere. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and its own mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. It's the salute, by starting and useful to us this person in America, I am very grateful to the United States, to the United States, which we are deeply grateful, because we know all the sacrifices that this country has made for us to give us freedom democratic when we have intervened so presently in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men. So today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocino of democracy and have operated intelligently because it is to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in the world. And, well, onorevole Imperiteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work, because democratic freedom is really being extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. Not easy, our goal. Forse talvolta we italiani non siamo compresi. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is happened right when we were gravated by the weight of the confliction. In Aleut� decir. We have lost time with Imperial people around the world, обязательно. in which our work could be exploited, but the attack of this force, this democratic faith, was so alive that we had taken our work. We have worked, we have worked, we have worked, we have worked for the country to rebuild our country. It is with these sentiments, the Hon. Imperiteri, that I salute you and the city of New York and I tell you that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in searching your land is an example to all the Genoveses. Derisier, not credible, contrasting by every man and the men and the men knew that this great land existed and he searched it disperately, and he testified, and he searched the road in turn of stone down on theach which he wanted to find for a book called everyone in christian decal learning and he goes on to all the world with all things in our k정을 whether they find a path or even one of us if they start working by others are the road figured out because everyone is free in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, Prince of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great man which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
