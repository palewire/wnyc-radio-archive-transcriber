To our kind old alma mater, our rock-bound island home, we'll tell black men, y'all, on regret, as for my feet we roam. Until on our last battle's fear, the light of heaven shall flow. We'll never fail to drink to birth, and Benny Haven's hope. Oh, Benny Haven's hope, oh, Benny Haven's hope, we'll sing our reminiscence of Benny Haven's hope. May the army be augmented, so more than we let's flow. May our country in the hour of peace be ready for the fall. May the time of those who let's be a chosen hope. We're thrown in love, in thy heart's pain. May the time of those who let's be a chosen hope. May the time of those who let's be a chosen hope.
