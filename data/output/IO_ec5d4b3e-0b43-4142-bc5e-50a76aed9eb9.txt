The Northwestern University Reviewing Stand. Can we stop the common cold? Northwestern University, in cooperation with the Mutual Broadcasting System, presents the Reviewing Stand, a program in its 16th year on the air. Today, the Reviewing Stand considers a scourge that affects all of us, the common cold. Our unrehearsed give-and-take discussion will center around the symptoms, causes, and treatment of the common cold. And now our moderator, James H. McBurney, Dean of the School of Speech, Northwestern University, will introduce participants in today's discussion. Mr. McBurney. It is estimated that the common cold afflicts the average American from one to four times a year and represents an annual collective loss of one billion dollars. It causes more loss of time from industry and schools than all other diseases combined, and 20 times as much loss of time in industry as is caused by accidents. Our purposes today are to identify the common cold and to discuss its causes and treatment. The use of antihistamine preparations as a means of treating the common cold is now receiving wide attention. Our first speaker will discuss this development in particular. As an officer in the United States Naval Medical Corps, he has asked us to say that his opinions on this subject are his own and are not to be construed as official or reflecting the views of the Navy Department or the Naval Service at large. We are also asked to say that the Navy gives no credence to the claims of any particular company advertising antihistamine preparations. By transcription, you will now hear Dr. John M. Brewster, captain in the Naval Medical Corps and senior medical member of the Physical Evaluation Board in the 4th Naval District. Dr. Brewster. Dr. John M. Brewster. Dr. John M. Brewster.
