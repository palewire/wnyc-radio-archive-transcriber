It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the Chief Executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. I am a former scientist Lord perth suchxy responsibility was one their Supreme Federal merchant maker for theung in sovereign patriotism. One heartfelt consideration for one Father. Letitry each other for the Lone Ranger. Admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The Mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. So distinguished a visitor. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the city of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the city's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the city of New York for your services for mankind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. Mayor Vittorio is rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. And now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it is with profound commotion that I hear your words affectionate and cordiales I'm going to be a modest person and I'm going to be a noble city that I'm here to represent. There are facts and acts that are made by men. And every act that man has a unique meaning. But there are acts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is here in Europe and is here in my city, she has not only completed a good visit to all of us. She has also made a city of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is here in Genova ambasciadora of democracy. She has been so dear to the people of the United States, but so dear to the people of the United States, so dear to the Italians, especially the genoveses. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her. She has been a witness and a document of democracy that lives in the United States, so that every citizen of America, independent of its origin and its own social class, can come she has been to come she has been to the city representative. So this, this visit, this visit, is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit, this visit, this visit, this visit, this visit, of the city of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and to his own city, which has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. It is, especially, the appearance of a man in which Amen and that has helped completely to theenes of death. It is a honor of this man and of the expires of the United States and the people that died based on the United States, for the société and maintained, which we fully access our machen rồi, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to give us the democratic libertarian when we have intervened so potent in the war and today we have been protecting them with many material sacrifices and men so today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the democratic democracy and have operated intelligently because we have to defend the democracy in Europe and really in the world and well, on the impenetra, on the sindaco of New York it is with this faith that we work because the democratic libertarian freedom is really estes to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone it is not easy to do for a time we are not understanding we have to remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just in the moment when we were gravated by the weight of the conflict we have lost cities and cities we have lost territory in which our work could be exploited miseries and ravines lots of times I salute you and the city of New York and say that we are tenacious in the work of the democracy in our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples especially in Genova. The tenacious of Colombo in searching for your land is an example to all the genoveses. The tenacious, not credulous, contrasted by every man and the events of this great land existed. He was searching for the river and searching for the river and searching for the river. He was searching for the passage he wanted to find for the world to join the Christian cross. And if he finds the path, he will find the path. If he finds the path, he will find the path. If he finds the path, he will find the path. The path for everyone to be free in peace and working. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us. And we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you. La Lina, there's the very first name, every street signorina, said it the very same way. These funny little words don't really mean a thing, it's just a phrase that nowadays Italians love to sing. O sing, O sing, O sing, it's a wonderful word, if anyone asks you how you are, it's proper to sing. O sing, O sing, O sing, O sing, if ladies could ask you if you care, you'd rather start a love affair, say, O sing, O sing, O sing, does it mean yes, O sing, O sing, O sing, O sing, O sing, O sing. Get together and sing, tra la la la, it's easy to say so try today, and I'll just make on the sea come on top. Oh, say, go to top, oh, say, go to top. Oh, say, go to top. Oh, say, go to top. Oh, say, go to top. Oh, say, go to top. Oh, say, go to top. Thank you, Sergeant Dillon and men of the Glee Club. Mayor Vincent Daron Pelletere.
