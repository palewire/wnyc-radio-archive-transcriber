What for? I've got no lock on the door That's the way to be They can steal the drugs from the floor That's okay to speak For the things that I try Like the stars in the skies are on me Oh, I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I've got my gal Got my tongue Her head is a whole day long Do you complain it? Got my gal Got my gal Got my door Got my door Got my door I've got my gal I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I'm got the sun And the moon And the people see The folks with plenty of money Got to pray all the day He's got plenty I'm not the worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am the friend of hell, in a time to ride. Never want to be long as I'm well. Never want to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm the boy?
