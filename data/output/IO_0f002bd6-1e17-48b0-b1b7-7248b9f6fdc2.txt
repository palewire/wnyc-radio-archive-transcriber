The Chainsaw of the Welfare with God Oh, I got plenty of nothing And love is plenty for me I got no car, got no mule I got no misery The folks with their feet at the feet Got a lot on the door Pray somebody's a-goin' to rob them But without a-make-in-more What for? What for? I got no car, got no car I got no car, got no car That's the way to be They can steal the rug from the floor That's okay to speak For the things that I try Like the stars in the skies are on me Oh, I got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I got my gal, got my son I got my son I had him the whole day long Do you complainin'? I got my gal, got my gal Got my gal, got my lord Got my lord, got my son I got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I got the sun I got the moon I got the people see The folks with plenty of money Got to pray all the day He's the plenty And nothing's a warrior He's the devil away Away, away Away I am the friend of hell Well, I'm not worthy of nothing, and nothing's like me. I trust my gals, trust my gals, for heaven all day long. Now you complain it. Trust my gals, trust my lord, trust my lord.
