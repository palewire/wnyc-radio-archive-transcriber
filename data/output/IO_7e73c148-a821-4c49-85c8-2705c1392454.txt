having fun with your family and so here she is Becky Ryer good morning city mothers we're back again this morning talk about ways of having fun with your children summer vacation is pretty well along now most of you are right in the swing of enjoying it and making plans for what to do with the rest of the vacation weeks this program hopes you're having fun you and your children together fun comes from the heart it is your own warmth reaching out to join and share in the happiness of others it is your effort to help create more happiness for yourself and those you love and care about the bigger hearted people have the wider circle of those they're interested in and they help create social happiness and sound public welfare but happiness and fun begin at home as all of your mothers know the more intelligent your concern is about the fun your children have the more you and they will get out of your life together and the more your children and you will eventually contribute in good fellowship to the community you live in some of you may remember that last week Dr. Lindeman urged New Yorkers to get out and study nature in their parks right here in New York City he said that our parks offered every opportunity to study all the flowers trees and bushes that grow in this hemisphere and he reminded us that all the birds of the northeastern part of the United States passed through New York at some time Dr. Lindeman said he wished New Yorkers would stop thinking that museums were the only place to study nature I tried to have him go a little easy on that because of today's guest John Saunders the associate curator of education at the Museum of Natural History I'd like to tell you a little bit about Mr. Saunders where he's the perfect guest on WNYC Mr. Saunders is an example of a New York boy taking full advantage of what New York offers its boys he was born and brought up in New York attended the Evander Childs High School in the Bronx and on graduation went down to the museum to get a job he'd been in the museum just once before in his life he got a job in the lantern slide division packing slides and he got interested in his work and the museum started going to city college nights and then he won a summer scholarship at Princeton and then they put him on the staff of the museum and then he studied some more at New York University in fact he's still studying for his PhD and today he's one of the distinguished staff members of one of the most famous museums in the world the American Museum of Natural History we're very fortunate indeed in having Mr. Saunders with us Mr. Saunders forgive me for making you squirm through this long introduction but I thought mothers with boys of their own growing up in the city would like to hear about a New York boy who'd done so much with what the city offered him Mr. Saunders most people are a little afraid of museums and they don't know how to get the most out of them would you tell us a little first on how to use the museum and talk to Lindemann who told the WNYC radio audience to study nature outdoors and I agree I think the visits to the museum should be in connection with visits to the zoo the botanical gardens and to our excellent parks the museum should supplement and enlarge the impressions gained there many questions can be answered here that arise at the zoo or in the parks the zoos exhibit show and display and we have further detailed scientific knowledge about the animals also the zoos have their problem of keeping their animals alive and healthy and we have specimens that stand indefinitely for concentrated observation funny I never realized that a stuffed animal had those points in its favor and that is particularly true of our birds they look so lifelike in their backgrounds in the dioramas prepared by expert artists they look as if they could fly away any minute but they can't and the museum can boast of having the finest bird collection in the world there's quite a collection on birds of the pacific isn't there indeed there is mrs raya since the war that section on birds of the pacific has been extremely popular we have specimens and backgrounds from the fiji rattle canal new guinea mr saunders is it easy and simple to find all these special sections in the museum there is a map at the entrance there's a guidebook available and smaller bulletins explanations and descriptions of everything available in the museum but mothers would get more out of the museum if they telephoned before they came just what do you mean mr saunders telephone to whom telephone the museum we're in the phone book and decat 28500 and asked for the guest services division at extension 342 or extension 255 or asked for me at my office we're always eager and prepared to plan trips through the museum according to person's special interests and we try to satisfy children's curiosity people tend to do too much in a visit to the museum don't they many people mrs raya they come once and they feel that they have done the museum it's like going to the public library and trying to read all the books in it the most important thing for both the mother and the children is not to get overtired the museum has hard floors there are few seats we're not exactly designed for comfort people get tired walking around especially children then too the museum is at fault exhibits are apt to be overcrowded people start by looking long and fixedly with complete absorption at one exhibit then their eyes light on a long vista of halls each opening on to the other they see a whole series of exhibits beckoning to them and they go scurrying through them distracted and exhausted what would you recommend to a mother and her children as a first visit program to the museum mr saunders for any child almost without exception for the first visit and it's something mother and children can do together a visit to the planetarium the show goes on every afternoon at two o'clock there's a preliminary talk altogether the show lasts from one to one and one quarter hours everyone loves it there's an admission fee to the planetarium show isn't there yes there is it's about 35 cents it's the only admittance fee the museum charges also because once the show starts it is in utter darkness and there can be no interruptions children under five are not admitted it's well for mothers to find out about the shows they change every month this month there's a show on the summer stars mothers and children seeing that show could have an awful lot of fun picking out the summer stars couldn't they they surely could and next month the planetarium show will take you to the moon that is even more thrilling than most i bet some of the listening mothers have already made a note of that take children to the moon via museum some august day at two o'clock the planetarium has comfortable seats it's air conditioned and if mothers can manage an early lunch at home or in our cafeteria then they could get in some one special exhibit fairly thoroughly before the planetarium show what would you suggest well i would like to see mothers supplement the studies children have had at school it's up to the mothers to encourage the use of the museum to find out if the school her children are attending use of the museum most of the public schools use the museum regularly as part of their curriculum and the private schools do too but their visits are in large groups and an interested child hates to leave and always wants to come back again how do the schools and museums cooperate mr saunders most mothers would like to hear about that i'm sure the children in the public schools have special field of study each year let's start with the third grade they study among other things indian life we have five excellent indian halls they are divided regionally children see how indians get their food how they adjust to their environment and the third grade teachers bring them on special visits to the indian section exactly but children who like to sketch who are interested in designs might like to come back when there was more time and perhaps bring a sketchbook along what are some of the other school grade interests that mothers could supplement this summer mr saunders the fourth year studies china eskimos and africa our exhibit is on old china but we make a point of indicating that there is a new china as well and we suggest books and other exhibits on eskimos our exhibit is a pretty accurate contemporary one on africa we have a great deal the famed akley hall with its multitude of specimens of animals gives a true picture of wildlife in africa there's a pygmy exhibit and numerous other native exhibits what about the children's curiosity in regard to their own country i was just coming to that the fifth year study of the united states our new north american mammal hall has a pretty complete picture of wildlife in our own land and we have a series of really excellent relief models that give a pretty good idea of what the country looks like where we have mountains and just about how it would look if seen from an airplane our children are air minded they'd love that they do love it and they love the mineral and gem collection too mothers with children and the other grades may feel we're neglecting them perhaps we better cover all the grades mr saunders the sixth year is divided in two parts the first half studies mexico and central and south america we have a chiefly primitive exhibits on the americas such as an intensive exhibit on the indians of ecuador i wish we had more data on contemporary life in the american republics the exhibit on aztec and mayan cultures in mexico or archaeology and ancient silver and hand-wrought products of peru are very fine but i sometimes think that our children get a distorted idea of the present cultures does europe from where so many new york children's parents and grandparents come have a good exhibit that's our biggest gap unfortunately the sixth year second half studies europe and our exhibit on that continent is very feeble we have practically nothing on european mammals and nothing on its geography no relief maps at all maybe we'd better rush on to the seventh grade perhaps so we can do a good job for the seventh they study asia and africa and we have extensive exhibits on those lands what do you offer the eighth grade well they again are studying the united states and we have a lot to show but i'm looking hopefully ahead when we will have more interpretive exhibits stressing economic geography the museum may reflect somewhat a period of academic divorce from commercialism for example take a fish fish has been treated biologically and scientifically but you might never guess if it were salmon that it was canned and that there was a whole industry built around it that it was eaten for example what do you offer the high school ages well they're on their own more or less with definite ideas of what they're looking for the science course in high schools can be advantageously supplemented with a visit to the darwin hall or to the exhibit on the natural history of man i hope mothers won't get the idea i want them merely to supplement their children's school studies that's just one way of using the museum we have free motion pictures all year round excepting during the month of august on wednesday and saturday afternoons but mothers get the museum habit mr saunders how can they keep track of what is going on at the museum telephone us or be put on our mailing list watch for the monthly programs of events posted at every school and library i hope you don't mind my saying this mr saunders but when i was in your office i thought it looked a little like a boys or girls museum with its snake in a terrarium a lot of shells a ship model i suppose you'd call it a private museum but everything has a reason for being there kids love to start a museum of their own and mothers would make them happy by helping them make one butterflies they've caught some fish have a terrarium moss or berries that they pick up in the woods mr saunders please don't tell me you're about to advocate a snake in every home hardly but i do wish that most people were not so afraid of animals they communicate that fear to their children and they should use discretion mr saunders what would you say if your five-year-old nancy picked up a snake well i'd say nothing if it were a harmless snake if it wasn't i might say well put it on the ground nancy watch it crawl and i would really advise parents to learn their snakes most of them are harmless advise most parents to go to the museum of natural history i suppose to all museums mrs raya other museums the city has many of them well i'm afraid our time is up thank you very much mr saunders for coming to us today i'm sure the mothers and children can hardly wait to pay a visit to the american museum of natural history at 79th street in central park west next week at this time our guest will be mrs corinne dalgaard superintendent of the children's museum of the bronx zoo goodbye till tuesday thank you becky ryer and thank you john saunders becky ryer comes to us each tuesday morning at 10 o'clock when she brings a distinguished guest with her this morning her guest was john saunders the associate curator of education at the american museum of natural history and becky ryer always comes to you and tells you something about having fun with your family
