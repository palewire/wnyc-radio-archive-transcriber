The Right Revenant Monsignor Edward Roberts Moore, pastor of Old St. Peter's Church, will now read from the Scriptures. Prayer adapted from the Book of Leviticus, the 19th chapter, the 11th to the 18th verse. O Lord our God, help us to be mindful of the word Thou hast spoken through Moses, thy servant. Do not wrong thy neighbor or despoil him by violence. Do not withhold the wages of thy hired servants till morning comes. Do not miscall the deaf or put a stumbling block in the blind man's way. Thou hast the vengeance of thy God to fear, the Lord's vengeance. O Lord our God, help us to be mindful of the word Thou hast spoken through Moses, thy servant. Do not wrong thy neighbor or despoil him by violence. Do not withhold the wages of thy hired servants till morning comes. Do not miscall the deaf or put a stumbling block in the blind man's way. O Lord our God, help us to be mindful of the word Thou hast spoken through Moses, thy servant. Do not pervote justice by giving false awards, taking a man's poverty into account, or flattering the great. Give every man his just due. Do not whisper calumniers in the public ear and swear away thy neighbor's life. The Lord hears thee. O Lord our God, help us to be mindful of the word Thou hast spoken through Moses, thy servant. Do not nurse resentment against thy brother. Put thyself in the right by confronting him with his fault. Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge for wrong done to thee by thy fellow citizens. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Thy Lord is his. Amen. Marie LaGuardia will now make a presentation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
