The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay These areires Something tells me I am near at the front to fight the foe. Give us, soldier boys, a marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, fall in, it won't be long. We're on our way, hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, hooray. Hanson's makes the heart grow fonder. Ooh. Fels and snakes, the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I thunder. Wandering, darling, is your truth. Distance only lands and shams there. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near you. Be near your heart. Near your heart. She was happy till she met you. And the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you. You will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother. Just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. She will be happy. She will be happy. She will be happy. When the heavens sail the river. She will be happy. She will be happy. She will be happy. She will be happy. She will be happy. She will be happy. And the sun gets flowers blue. She dies so clear. She dies so clear. She dies so clear. You will see the word you said. You will speak the word you said That's the time we do shall wear When the harvest days are over Jesse dear, my Jesse dear The End Jesse would come with a strong head and a dog And the band played on He'd like to come from the floor With a trail he adored as the band played on But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded The poor girl would shake me along He's there is a girl with a small landing ground And the band played on Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline My Adeline My Adeline At night, dear heart At night, dear heart At night, dear heart For you I find For you I find In all my dreams In all my dreams Your fair face Your fair face Your fair face You're the flower of my heart Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline He's only a man in a fearless day A beautiful sight to see You may think he's happy and free from care He's not about his dreams to be He's done when you think of a wasted life For you cannot make me wait And her beauty was sold For an old man's gold He's a bird in a gilded day A little brown car A shady green spot So happy home I find My heart's barely gone I love only one She's the girl I have to be mine Just one girl Only just one girl Where all of us I know But there must be I'll be happy forever with just one girl I'll be happy for the future Wonder I'll be happy for the future A little girl And I'll be happy for the future But just one girl And that's as far as I To be happy for the future Prisoners For the future He's dönem I wonder Whether they will Or be happy for the future прир time Everything We happiness The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End
