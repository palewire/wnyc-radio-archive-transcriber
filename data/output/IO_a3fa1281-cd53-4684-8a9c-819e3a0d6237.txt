She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow's last is blue. There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manners, too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I see. The End Comrade, comrade, comrade, ever since we were boys, sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Comrade, comrade, comrade, ever since we were boys, I see. Comrade, comrade, ever since we were boys, I see. When danger's reddened, my darling, old comrade, was there by my side.

There's a father unforgiving. And a picture that is true for the world.
