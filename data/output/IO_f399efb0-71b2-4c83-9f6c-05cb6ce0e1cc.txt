It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa, on that occasion, made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications, as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has, on many occasions, proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. when he was elected mayor of Genoa last year. He defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic person. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. and when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scarni of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased, indeed, to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And, Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Thank you. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the Mayor and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. and now here again, Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa.

She also gave an homage to the city-mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent to recognize the people of the Genovese so connected to the land of America. But she, the Honorable Imperiteri, was also been to Genova ambassador of democracy. Democracy! Democracy! That is so expensive to the people of the United States, but so expensive, so expensive, so expensive, so expensive, so expensive, so expensive. For this, Honorable Imperiteri, we are grateful because she was a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, for which every citizen American, independent of its origin, of its own social class, can come she has been to come she has been to the high level representative of the city.

It's not easy to do. For some time we don't understand it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just in the moment we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We were lost in the country in which our work could be exploited, misery and ruin, but this force, this democratic freedom was so alive that we had taken our work. We have worked. We work. We work. We work for our country to rebuild our country. It's with these sentiments, on the other hand, that I salute you and the city of New York and say that we are tenacious in the work of the democracy in our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in searching your own land is an example to all the genoveses.

Grazie. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which mean so much to us and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great man which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
