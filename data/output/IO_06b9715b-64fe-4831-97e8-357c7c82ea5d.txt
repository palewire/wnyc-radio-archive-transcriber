Thank You This is Georgie Stoll and the orchestra on Here's to Veterans, the best in music for all you ex-servicemen and women and your folks everywhere, especially transcribed for you by the Veterans Administration in cooperation with the American Federation of Musicians. Yes, it's hello to all you ex-GIs and your families from Georgie Stoll and the orchestra. Here is a musical quarter hour designed for your listening pleasure, tunes from some of Hollywood's greatest pictures. Later on, I'll have a special word for all you veterans. But first, let's relax to a new arrangement of an old, old standard. It's easy listening to You Were Meant For Me. You Were Meant For Me. You Were Meant For Me. You Were Meant For Me. You Were Meant For Me. You Were Meant For Me.
