I speak of government and the art of architecture. First a question, is architecture an art today? The immense complexity of our functional and technical requirements, the infinite ramifications of the trade, the business, and the science of building, make the maintenance of control over the material agencies of building by the art of building, that is architecture, a Herculean task. Nevertheless, that control must be maintained, and government should see to it that only architects who have proved themselves capable of maintaining artistic control over the complex material problems of building, are selected to design government projects at all levels of magnitude. That, then, is the crux of the problem arising from the relation of government to the art of architecture, the controlled selection of architects of high artistic and executive capacity. But before going into that, I must clear away another question. Will there be a tendency, when government civil building becomes active again, to set up architectural design staffs within government agencies to the general exclusion of private architects? The answer to this question is, I believe, no. When I was in the government service from 1942 to 1945, as deputy commissioner for design and construction in the Public Buildings Administration, I found there was no thought of returning to the system prevalent during the Depression, under which a huge centralized architectural design staff was maintained in Washington. Not only had that system proved to drag on individual talent, it had also proved so exhausting to the executive staff charged with administering it, that nearly all my fellow administrators who had lived through the years of the system's prevalence were afflicted either with ulcers and allergies, or with neuroses and other ills characteristic of mental and physical exhaustion. So the commissioner of public buildings, my chief, himself suffering from almost every ill known man as a consequence of his devotion to duty, was determined to reduce his staff to the level of an effective checking and supervising organization to process the design work of private architects employed under contract. This was accomplished while I was serving under him. So much for that. And now as to the selection of private architects as artists, the commissioner was equally determined to select only the best. He and I did not always see eye to eye as to which architects were the best, but he invariably lent a sympathetic ear to my opinions and finally delegated control over the selection of architects to me as his deputy. This control proved to be illusory, however, however, I need not enlarge on the number of political influences near and far that affect decisions in government, nor on the power of the Congress to discipline any of its servants who flout these influences by cutting off their supplies. Yet these influences, so far as my observation went, were generated neither by mercenary nor by any other so-called sinister motives. They were rather the result of normal democratic respect for the opinions of the voters, wherever they might reside, whether in the great cities or the remotest villages. Of course these influences did not directly affect the selection of architects. They were brought to bear on the kind of architecture that was produced. But it is obvious that an architect who is an artist has convictions about the kind of architecture he produces and will produce no other. So it is a natural tendency to select as architects competent but amiable and amenable eclectics to avoid the difficulties raised by troublesome artistic convictions that disturb the rest of local chambers of commerce. Yet by necessity, as of today, public taste is whimsical and transitory, based as it is on women's magazines which promote art chiefly and quite arbitrarily to stimulate the sales of their advertisers. And as one of these publications says, never underestimate the power of a woman. Let me add, behind the throne. So in fact, with the best intentions in the world, and with apparent freedom of choice, government servants charged with the selection of architects tended to follow current taste in their selection. It happened during my term of service that an excellent progressive design for a large government building had to be discarded owing to public clamour against it. Clumber from a remote town, which the agency I served had no means of stilling by the soft answer that turneth away wrath. The architect was dismissed and paid off. All his work went for nothing. And another architect had to be paid to do it over. This sort of thing is administratively and budgetarily very perturbing to a well-ordered agency that has to justify its acts at congressional hearings at the end of every fiscal year. What can be done about all this? To my untuited mind, there is only one answer. A high appointee of art commission, above suspicion of personal interest, should be charged with the selection of architects and the certification of the artistic merit of their designs. Not only should they be charged with certifying these designs, but also with justifying them and defending them in the local communities where they are to be executed. The agencies responsible for executing them should, of course, serve as consultants to the commission in all its acts. I am not aware of the dangers inherent in the control of art by a commission. Such potential dangers, however, are preferable to safety from criticism procured by submission to public whim and clamour. It is the experience of every architect worth his salt that the works which are most violently attacked as an insult to the public taste when first exposed to view become in the end the pride and delight of the community.
