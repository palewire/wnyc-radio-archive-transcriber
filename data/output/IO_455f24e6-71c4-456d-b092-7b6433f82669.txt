Officers and men of George Legg, Admiral Berkley, today at this reception, I feel proud and happy as mayor of this city to extend to you and to Mr. Consul General my heartiest expression of welcome to this historic City Hall. This memorable occasion binds another tie of friendship and mutual admiration between the great Republic of France and the United States, and more especially between your people and the citizens of this metropolis. The French cruiser which you command, Captain Villon, is particularly welcome on its mission of peace and culture. You and your men have been entrusted by France to convey to our city hundreds of rare and beautiful tapestries, the most priceless treasures in the possession of your country for the enjoyment and edification of our citizens. The Metropolitan Museum of Fine Arts, in the months to come, will house this magnificent display of French art. The event will contribute immensely to the realization that France remains the great bastion of Western European culture that she has always been. On behalf of all of our citizens, Mr. Consul General and Captain Villon, I wish to extend our gratitude through you to the people of France for this noble gesture of friendship. I want you to know, for my own part, that the visit of the Georges Legues has been a source of delight to me personally. Our citizens are most happy to have you with us. I trust that this manifestation on the part of France will lead to many future expressions of the friendly relations which have always bound our two countries to the world. our two countries in peace as well as in war. Again, sir, my profound gratitude to you. And may you stay with us be a most pleasant one. Our citizens will reign Gaston, thank you very much. . Prince Consul General Chancel.
