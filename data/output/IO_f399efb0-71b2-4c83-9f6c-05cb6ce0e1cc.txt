And with me only to ит do棐� 015 Four it is a freuen coming to envelop for emperor, of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gaspary. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Skerney of Genoa during his visit here to scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished for so distinguished a visitor. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy, but throughout the world, expressed to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor, Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it's with profound commotion that I've heard your words affectionate and cordiales revolting to my modest person and revolting to the noble city that I have here the honor of represent. There are some facts and acts that are made of men and every act that man has a own meaning but there are some acts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Honorable Impeleteri, is come to Europe and is come to my city, she has put on the behalf of each other to all体 GRADU and her in the many years she also gave us theальное going for the city on behalf of Christophaniam and everyone else! And this is been sent to the knowledge of the genovese so connected to the land of America. But she, the Hon. Impeliteri, has been to Genova ambasciadora of democracy. That is so expensive to the United States, but so expensive to the Italians, especially the Genovese. For this, the Hon. Impeliteri, we are grateful for her, because she was a testimony and document of democracy that lives in the United States, and so every citizen of America, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come to the high level of representative of the city. So, this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of the Hon. Impeliteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States, and his mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. This visit is the salute of the United States, and the great people of the United States, and the great people of the United States, which we are deeply grateful for our lives, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made up for us to give us freedom democratic freedom, when we have intervened so much in the war, and today we have been able to protect them with many sacrifices material and of men, so we can say that the United States have taken the support of democracy and have operated intelligently, because we have done it in Europe and really in the world to defend it. And, as you know, the Hon. Impeliteri, Hon. Sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work, because we are really democratic freedom and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For some time we are not understanding, we are not understanding. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just when we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We have beaten a village, Stephanolo, the婦 a empire, the reproductive system. We must wipe us our jobs to outright dest oppressors, but our gun-m pregnancies and power up we usedרהomos, the democracy and to this Monicaönliches, and we have broken us, there are so practical Aryans bursting out there, we have transported us, we worked our work, cooperatively working with дел Congratulations for a perspective and material for our Siegeist, we will have to be 101 Lucky for our M belangrijkциporoscへ. I am with these sentiments, onorevole Imperiteri, that I salute you and the city of New York and say that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of our democracy in our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genova. The tenacious of Colombo in searching for your land is an example to all the genoveses. The tenacious, not credible, contrasted by every man and the events of the world, this man knew that this great land existed and looked at it. He went to the mountains and looked at the mountains and looked at the mountains and looked at the mountains, looked at the mountains, looked at the mountains that he wanted to find for everyone to join the world with the Christian cross. The way it is, it is not important if he then found the passage, it is not important if he found the passage, if we have to persist, another will find the way to find the way. The way it is, it is to make everyone safe, in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to general, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great man which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
