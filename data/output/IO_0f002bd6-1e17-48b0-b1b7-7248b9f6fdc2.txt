On the banks of Allen Water, Now is the May and King. The Banks of Allen Water, Where the road of spread is so, There has come them all. The Millers of her, But she's blinded by the road. For the summer, The Greek and water, And the soldier, Polk, the king. The Millers of the Saga, The King. On the banks of Allen Water, When the winter snow fell past, There was a sea of the miller's lonely daughter, The miller's lonely daughter, Chilling blues of land. The miller's lonely daughter, Chilling blues of land. The miller's lonely daughter, Chilling blues of land. The miller's lonely daughter, Oh, control and careless dream. From the banks of Allen Water, Here the hill of the lake, Chilling blues of land.

I've got plenty of nothing. And love is plenty for me. I've got no car, got no mule, got no misery. The coast is plenty of plenty. Found a lock on the door. Great dumb bodies are going to rock. But without a making more. What for? What for? I've got a lock on the door. That's the way to be. Take and steal the rug from the floor. That's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all big. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing. And nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my tongue, My head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gals, got my lor, got my tongue. I've got my gals, got my gals, got my gals. I've got plenty of nothing. And nothing's plenty for me. I've got the sun, got the moon, And the people see. The coast with plenty of plenty. Got to pray all the day. Keeps the plenty. You don't have to worry. I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell. In a time to ride. Never want me long as I'm well. Never want to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm the Lord? I've got plenty of nothing. And nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, For heaven's whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gals, got my gals, Got my lor, got my lor, got my lor.
