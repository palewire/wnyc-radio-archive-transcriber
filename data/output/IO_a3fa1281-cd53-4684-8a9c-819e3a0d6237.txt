The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the fog, I hear the fog, I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, babe Goodbye, darling, I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tell me I am near the end Tell me, I am near the end, I am near the end Tells me, I am near the front, to fight the foe I hear the beautiful calling, goodbye darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear. And fear and gay, come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, it won't be long, we're on our way. It's pit for rain, we're going down south, whoo-ray. And since makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. And since makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I thunder. One ring, darling, is your true. Distance only lands and shone lands. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. The sea of thunder. Longing to be near you. Be near your side. Be near your side. Be near your side. Be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother. Just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over. Yes, she is here. Christ has been here. When the sun gets flowers, you need to die so clear. He's died so clear. You will see the word you said. You will see the word you said. That's the time we do shall wear. When the harvest days are over. Just be near, my Jesse. Ja'Veal. Ja'Veal. Ja'Veal. Ja'Veal. Ja'Veal. Ja'Veal. Ja'Veal.

He is the first line of man on my body. The way's jolly, I've had it through, I know. Two little girls in blue, lad. Two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad. Who won your father's heart. Became your mother, I married the other. But we have drifted apart. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manner too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I too. Come, lad. Come, lad. Come, lad. Come, lad. Come, lad. Come, lad. Ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Come, lad. When man was born, they blew my life in time. When danger's precious, my darling, old comrade was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken, and a mother's heart have broken. There is just another missing from the old home where we belong. There is still a memory living. There's a father of the forgiving, and a picture that is home from the world. There is still a memory living. There's still a memory living. There is still a memory living. She's my sweetheart, I'm her beau. She's my Annie, I'm her beau. Goodwill rally, never to pass. With her Annie to me, is my sweetheart. One evening in the month of May, I met old Satan on the way. I looked old Satan in the eye, if you want to get to heaven when you die. If you want to get to heaven, then go away. Get your guns, get your guns. Roll it on, roll it on, roll it on. Roll it on, roll it on, roll it on. Get your guns, get your guns. Roll it on, roll it on, roll it on, roll it on. Get your guns, get your guns. Get your guns, get your guns. The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End
