I got my gal, got my son, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my son. I got plenty in the bill, and nothing's ready for me. I got the sun, got the moon, got the people see. The folks with plenty in the bill, and the pray all the day. Keep the plenty, don't have to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away, I am a friend of hell, in a time of life. Never want me long in the well, never want me strive to be gone, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm the Lord? I got plenty in the bill, and nothing's ready for me. I got my gal, got my son, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord.
