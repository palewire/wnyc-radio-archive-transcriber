When was the last time you stood at the corner of Broadway and Park Row? If you were there just as the hands of the clock kept a rendezvous at 12, you heard... The striking of another hour for New York City. A city rich with the history of 300 and more years. Rich with the strains of many peoples. You heard the chimes atop New York's historic City Hall. For over 137 years, the traditional office of His Honor, the Mayor. WNYC presents His Honor, the Mayor. Every week you've heard transcribed over the city's own station and saw pictured every Monday in the New York Journal-American, history-making episodes that have taken place in old New York on lower Manhattan Island during the early growth of the world's greatest city. Today, for the last program in this series, let's go back to 1808 and the beginning of New York's first public works project, the filling in of Collect Pond. The End In the early 1800s, the British and the French were at war. President Thomas Jefferson was keenly aware of the danger presented to our country by this struggle. The states were still weak from the long Revolutionary War and needed time to grow, to expand, to fortify themselves. Many steps were taken by the federal government to protect the United States. One of the measures was the passage of the Embargo Act in December 1807, which prohibited American vessels from leaving the United States for foreign ports and foreign vessels from taking cargoes out of this country. Although Jefferson meant this act to be a peace measure, it proved disastrous to our economy. Commerce was destroyed. Business was paralyzed. Failures occurred all over the country. Hardest hit were the port cities. Among them, New York. The Great Depression of 1808 was launched. New York's mayor and common council worked hard to ease the tragedy for its citizens. Work projects were proposed. Among them, the filling in of the Collect Pond. In January 1808, Mayor Marinus Willett was presiding over a meeting of the common council. And now, Mr. Mayor, we've come to the petition from the inhabitants in Grand and Broom streets and vicinity for lamps and watchmen. I move it be referred to the Lamp and Watchmen Committee. Second the motion. It is so ordered, gentlemen. Now I think we may take up the special report. Special report? What special report? Gentlemen, let the mayor finish. Gentlemen, as you know, the passage of the Embargo Act has worked great hardship on New York, a port city first and last. I'm not condemning Mr. Jefferson for his part in the strict ruling, but I must point out what it has done to New York, even so shortly after its adoption. Gentlemen, hundreds, perhaps thousands, are out of work. Why, just last night, I saw a child snatch a breadcrust from the snow. She was Jacob Wilmer. Well, that's all there is to it, Annie. I can't get work. Neither can any of the others. But, Jacob, the grocer has already told me that he can't give us any more credit. Mama! Oh, go back to sleep, dear. Now do. There, there's a girl. Mama, I'm hungry. Will we have breakfast tomorrow? Yes, dear, of course we will. Now try to sleep before you wake up your brothers and sisters. All right, Mama. Good night. And what do you suppose I'll feed them, Jacob Wilmer? Have we no meal left at all, then, Annie? Just a little. But I'll make it do somehow. I'll have to stretch it out. But what shall we do the day after tomorrow? And the day after that? Surely a man with a family can find someone... Annie, Annie, I've been trying to tell you... You've told me nothing that'll feed the children. Other than go out... Annie, please listen to me. You just don't know. Andrew Moore is in the same boat. So is John Steen. There's Nicholas Fisher and Martin. You're still not telling me how I'm to feed six hungry children. And mind you, I'm saying nothing of you and me. Annie, please try to understand. I've tried to get work. I'll do anything, anything at all. But there's no work to be had. When they pass the Embargo Act... The Embargo Act. The Embargo Act. What sense does that make? How can the President and Washington and the Congress have anything to do with your work? Or the lack of food in this house? The shipping has stopped, Annie. And it's thrown men out of work. The country needs her trade to live. If we can't send out goods to England and France, we can't sell them. We've made too much for it all to be bought in this country. But I still don't see what... And if goods are unsold and piled up in warehouses, men are out of work. Don't you see, Annie? The factories won't make more goods, you can be sure, just to have them stored away somewhere. You know, while other men are out of work. It goes on. I've been hard on you. I didn't mean it to be this way, but... We had such hopes when we were married. And the children. Whatever will we do? Oh, Jacob. There, there, my lady. Now, don't cry. There's word today that the Mayor and the Common Council have called a special meeting. They'll help people like us, Annie. Therefore, gentlemen of the Council, for the maintenance of that class of citizens for whom labor cannot be provided, the Committee proposes to issue rations of soup and meat four times a week in proportion to the numbers of their respective families. All well and good, Mr. Mayor, all well and good. But I say an able-bodied man should be made to work for his keep, sir. Yes. And what is your committee to say about that? Yes, what is it to say? That is taken up at the end of the report, sir, but you shall have it now, if you will. Let me see. Yes, yes, here it is. To provide for that class of citizens who are capable of laboring and who are destitute of occupation, the Committee has directed the Street Commissioner to examine how many car men and hands-to-load carts can be advantageously employed to fill Cullock Pond. There are other proposals, sir, along that line, which will employ a considerable number of persons at moderate wages. But will they be able to support their families, Mr. Mayor? We think so, sir. Mr. Mayor, as a member of the Committee, may I say a few words? Well, certainly, Mr. Livingston, you may proceed. The Committee flatters themselves, gentlemen, that the arrangements they have made will be equal to the conditions of the times. And I might add that the Common Council may rest assured that every possible economy will be rigidly observed in the distribution of charity. But that is quite clear, I think, Mr. Livingston. We thank you for your hard work on this matter. And now, Mr. Mayor, can we take up the matter of the homeless sailors in the city? The hour grows late, and the matter is urgent, sir. Yes, we've got to take up this matter now. This special meeting was called for that purpose, Mr. Mayor. And have you read their notice of the morning papers, Mr. Mayor, of the meeting they've called in the park? Why, they may be rioting there at this very moment. Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen, indeed, I read the notice of the meeting. As some of you know, I had handbills printed to counteract the possible trouble. As for rioting, sir, I think you do our visitors an injustice. They're honest men out of work, just as our citizens are. I have also sent a representative from this office to their meeting. I'm sure he is there now delivering my message to them in the park. One at a time, Wyatt, one at a time. You there, Nevins, what do you say? What we've all had to say, mate. How do we eat the rest of the winter? Now, if you'll only be quiet a minute, this gentleman from the mayor's office has brought a message from him. Will you let him read it? Okay, go ahead. Let him read it if you want. My friends, and the mayor asks me to specify that he does consider you friends. Some of you have seen the handbill the mayor had printed this morning. I won't read it all, but here is a pod. The mayor informs the public that the port city of New York will, in the present emergency, as they have done on previous occasions, provide for the wants of every person. Every person, mind that, lads. Provide for the wants of every person without distinction who may be considered proper objects of relief. You see, you will be taken care of. Now, will you disperse peacefully if I assure you that the matter is being discussed at this minute by the Common Council? And is the mayor to listen to a word or two from us? That's right! Can you take back word to the meeting? I think, under the circumstances, that would be fitting. I'll strike a bargain with you. If you will disperse peacefully, I'll carry back a message from you. Well, that's fair enough. Shall we read it out proper, lads? All right, lads. Levins, will you help me out with it? Aye, aye, Captain, sir. Then let's leave the park now, men. Nevins and I will write it out for this gentleman and he'll carry you to the meeting at once. Agreed? Right! And so, gentlemen of the Common Council and Mr. Mayor, having left the two sailors but five minutes ago, I beg leave to read the communication. I think we all want to hear it. You may proceed, sir. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I shall begin. Our situation is not only distressing, but truly alarming. The embargo lately levied upon our shipping has not only destroyed all employment by sea, but rendered it impossible to gain a sustenance by our labor on shore. Our humble petition to you, Mr. Mayor, is to know how we are to act in this case. The greatest part of the wages due us from our last voyages is already expended, and we are already indebted for our boarding. We are not objects of pity yet, but soon shall be if steps are not taken. We are, for the most part, hale and haughty men and would choose some kind of employment rather than the poorhouse. We humbly beg for your honor's aid and assistance. Awaiting your reply, sir, we are the distressed sailors in New York Harbor. Well, that's a very nice... A most fairly written document, gentlemen, and a moving plea. I am impressed with their good sense in the matter. Then, Mr. Mayor, we're to proceed as you outlined. Yes, gentlemen. As we've said, the same special committee, looking after the wants of your needy, has drawn up a plan of assistance for these stranded men of the sea. You've all heard it, how they're to be fed by us and lodged at the Navy Yard in Brooklyn. I think, gentlemen, when word of this plan is carried back to them, no ill consequences can result to the peace of this town. Gentlemen, in short, our public works project is well on its way towards success. And so the sailors were taken care of, as were families such as Jacob Wilmot's. And the city's first public works program got underway, the filling of Collect Pond. His honor, the mayor, has been transcribed by WNYC in cooperation with the New York Board of Education, the New York Journal American, the New York Public Library, the New York Historical Society, the Chamber of Commerce of the State of New York, and the Greater New York Civic Center Association.

Well, a little is to it, Annie. without saying anything but not. If you're not in the astrologer, he says. Please, follow me. You guys can't take that line with Totten. You're on the lookout.
