The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay The end I am he, I am he, head at the front to fight the foe. He was soldier boys on marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling, goodbye darling, pray. Come on down south, way way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along, come on join in the song, jump on, but it won't be long. We're on our way, it's pit foray. We're going downtown, to the air. We're on our way. We're on our way. We're on our way. We're on our way. Music playing, That is why I long for you Lonely through the nights I thunder Wondering, darling, if you're true Distance only lands and shams them Though the ocean waves divide Absence makes the heart grow thunder Longing to be near you Be near your heart She was happy till she met you And the fault is all your own If she wishes to forget you You will please leave her alone She has come to her old mother Just because there is no other She'll be happy in her own sweet home When the harvest days are over Yes, she's here, she's here And the sun gets flowers Oh, she's died so clear She's died so clear You will speak the word you said That's the time we do shall wear When the harvest days are over Jesse, dear, my Jesse He was a fool, a man in God And a band played on He'd light up the floor With a trail he adored And a band played on But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded, the poor girl would shake me along. He narrates a girl with a small learning crowd, and the past day long. Sweet Adeline, my Adeline, at night, dear heart, for you I find. In all my dreams, your fair-faced be. Your fair-faced be. You're the flower of my heart. Sweet Adeline, my heart, dear heart. Sweet Adeline, my heart, dear heart. He's only a man in a fearless day. A beautiful sight to fear. You may think he's happy and free from care. He's not the most he seems to be. She's done when you think of a wasted life. For you cannot make me wait. And her beauty was sold for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a gilded. A little brown car, a shady green star. So happy home I find. My heart's barely gone. My heart's barely gone. I love only one. She's the girl I have to be mine. Very good when you think of a July last year. Yeah, my heart's barely gone. But the room goes away. Who has been. She's the boy who's been strangled. And he always sticks along the middle and fell in love with you. The boy's beenaller. You are a poor man's gladman. How many? его have been made.

Don't you hear them bells, don't you hear them bells, say the ringing of the glory of the day. Hear them bells. Hear them bells. Ring it up the glory of the day. Ring it up the glory of the day. All the boys and all the girls, they love and love. The way you're in, I'll let you through, I know. Hear them bells, I love them, I love them. Hear them bells. Hear them bells. Two little girls in blue, lad. Two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad, who won your father's home, became your mother. I married the other, but we have drifted apart. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I see. You're a boy, you're mighty. You're a boy, you're a boy, you're a boy. Comrades, comrades, ever since we were boys, sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Comrades, when man was born, they blew all their life behind. When they just read us, my darling old comrades, what's there by my side? There's a name that's never spoken, And a mother's heart has broken. There is just another one missing From the old home that belongs There is still a memory living There's a father unforgiving And a picture that is true Who's long gone She's my sweetheart, I'm her home She's my honey, my bar toe She's my honey, my bar toe Good real valley, never to fall Little honey to me, is my sweetheart One evening in the month of May I met old Satan on the way I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die Get your gun, get your gun, get your gun Get your gun, get your gun Get your gun, get your gun If you want to get to heaven in the good old way Get your gun, get your gun Gun, get your gun T suced you good lamb Yann you get ya gun Get your gun Get your gun, get your gun The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End
