In the borough of Brooklyn, where we had 260,000 customers without service, we have restored electricity to nearly half of those, leaving 132,000 still without service at 10 o'clock this morning. In the borough of Queens, where 100,000 customers were affected by company estimates, there are still 71,000 without service at 10 o'clock. Of course, we have emergency crews in the field and are mending every effort to restore service as promptly as possible.
