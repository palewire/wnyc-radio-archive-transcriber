New York City, where seven and one half million people live in peace and enjoy the benefits of democracy. New York advances January 1st, 1939. Today on the threshold of a new year, the officials of the city of New York, headed by the mayor, the Honorable Fiorello H. Ligardia, and many of the heads of the various city departments, have gathered in the studios of the municipal station with an accounting of activity during the past year. Chief city in the state of New York, the greatest metropolis in these United States, the largest city in the Western Hemisphere, melting pot of nations, center of commerce, giant of industry. This is the Empire City. This is little old New York. On January 1st, 1938, the oath of office is administered for the second time to Fiorello H. Ligardia. At the home of Judge Seabury, the words of the oath are pronounced. I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of New York, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of mayor of the city of New York according to the best of my ability. Ladies and gentlemen of New York, we present the mayor of America's greatest city. The people of the city of New York, the commissioners, departments, bureaus, join with me in wishing you all a most happy new year. We want you to know that this is your city government, and that it is our duty and task to serve you and to serve you well. On behalf of the city administration, we wish you now a happy new year, and we'll endeavor in the next hour to present to you about five minutes of our daily work. This program, a dramatized review of the municipal year of 1938, is addressed to you, the seven and one half million people of New York. New York advances! The End Against the background of history stands a silhouette of sturdy proportions. It is a figure that has been the source for all civilization's advances. It is a figure that has shed more light on darkness, given more courage for achievement. It is a figure that is the strongest pillar of democracy, a figure that assays the past, holds up the present, and molds the future. It is the figure of the teacher. We introduce a member of New York's Board of Education, the Honorable Johanna M. Lindlop. I consider that the outstanding contribution of the Department of Education is the practice of democracy that is being fostered throughout the educational system and in its administrative offices. I believe that the commissioners are but the representatives of the public, that therefore the doors of their offices must always be open to interested citizens so that the commissioners may be constantly aware of what is in the mind of the people whom they represent. I believe that under no administration has there been a greater desire to improve the educational system of the city of New York and to meet all the needs of all the children intelligently. To accomplish this, none can give better assistance than a well-informed, cooperative citizenship. This tremendous educational system has not been a matter of overnight creation. The struggle for the present status has encompassed the full span of all the years of mankind. In the early days of our history, a group of solid, substantial, thrifty Dutch under the aegis of the West India Company came to the shores of America and settled on a piece of land at the approach of the Hudson River. This was New Amsterdam, a noisy, pulsing, vigorous colony of men and women, foreshadowing the gigantic energy of the New York of today. In common council, the good burghers gather for lawmaking. We come now to the matter of schools. It is your suggestion, Herr Van Herc, that we pattern our schools on those of our country? I do. For what use is the past unless the presents make use of it? I am inclined to agree. We are in a new country, and the best way we can make our children appreciate the honor and the possibilities of this venture is to educate them. We will all pay a tax for the upkeep of the school and the teachers, whom the worthy fathers will select. All the children whose parents cannot afford the fees of tuition will become the charges of the state. We shall proceed at once to erect this first school of New Amsterdam. This shall be the beginning. I hope that nobody will ever see the end. Thus was established in 1633 not only the first public school, but also the first school in American soil. In 1664, New Amsterdam fell before the British onslaught. The settlement became a town, developed and showed the first signs of cityhood and was renamed New York. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The declaration of America's independence, summed up in these thrilling words, are truly an early cornerstone of the American educational system. With a war with Britain at an end, the young country turns with high spirits to setting the house in order and turning it into a home. 1784. Six months after the cessation of the war, the New York State Assembly passed an act creating the University of the State of New York. Immediately, divergent opinions were voiced. We've just finished the war. Let education wait a while. We have enough worries. Let the parents attend to us children's education. It's a good idea, but where is the money coming from? I say, do you really mean that you intend to educate everybody, even the masses? At the state capitol, Governor Clinton's committee, headed by Alexander Hamilton, delivers a report. Your committee feels bound to add that erecting public schools for teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic is an object of very great importance, which ought not to be left to the discretion of private men, but be promoted by the public authority. 1849. The New York State Legislature enacts a law establishing free schools throughout the state. But the next year, the conservatives attack the measure and call for its repeal. The issue is placed before the people of the state. At the headquarters of the group, fighting for the law in New York City, a glum set of faces watch a blackboard. They're certainly tearing the bill to pieces upstate. You stupid fools. Throwing it to the line. We're 10,000 behind now. Have the New York City votes come in yet? It looks bad unless New York comes through with a tremendous vote. New York vote coming in. They're changing the board. What should the figures read? New York against repeal. 38,000. Gentlemen, that wipes out the upstate vote, saves the bill. We not only wipe out the upstate vote, but we wipe out the shame that would have been sure to result had the bill been repealed. Today, New York City possesses the greatest educational network of schools and cultural agencies. Here, 1,088,780 students attend schools whose functions have been broadened and expanded to match advancing social and economic needs. Problem. Richard Green, a high school graduate, is out of work. Each day, he makes the rounds. What's your experience been? I haven't had any, but I want to learn. Sorry, we have nothing for you. What was your last job? I'm just beginning, but I'll start small. Sorry, we have nothing for you. What is your background? I'm an apprentice. Sorry, we have nothing for you. But what are your qualifications? I haven't any, but I'll work hard. Sorry, we have nothing for you. The problem of vocational training has been met by the New York educational system. The year 1938 featured a highlight in this educational trend. November 29th, 1938. At 8th Avenue and 24th Street in Manhattan stands a new competent building. This is the Central High School of Needle Trades, just completed. Dedicating the school to its important purpose, the mayor of New York said in part, Other cities had better wake up if they want to take their place in American life. New York City is setting the pace. It is setting the right kind of example. The rest of the country will have to come up to our standards because we refuse to descend to the depths of theirs. Honor stone for democracy, an education for everybody, New York advances. A new moon The End I've seen life come and go and I've seen what sickness can do. And I think that of all the work I've done, I've gotten the most satisfaction from helping children. Because when you help a child, it's not so much a repair job as a construction project. Now, the Department of Health thinks so, too. They do one of their best jobs right here in the schools, looking after the health of the children. It's natural. The department is like a doctor with a great many patients, and the biggest job for a doctor is, after all, keeping his patients well. Now, I know a nurse, a very confident girl, who works in a city school. I'm sure something's wrong with Johnny Nurse. He doesn't sit or stand straight. He's dull and sleepy in class. He's massive. What did the school doctor's examination show? Johnny is suffering from malnutrition. My guess is that a visit to his home will tell us all we want and all. Hello, Johnny. Is your mother in? Huh? Oh, sure. Ma! Somebody wants to see you! Yes, I'm coming. Oh, who are you? I'm the nurse from the health center. Johnny was examined in school today, and I'd like to talk to you for a few moments, if I may. Come in and sit down. Johnny, bring in another chair from the kitchen. Okay, Ma. Is anything wrong with Johnny? That's what I've come to talk to you about. By the way, how's your husband? He always tries his best, but it's hard when a man's best days are behind him. A sick man is always the first to be laid off. He hasn't been working now for almost six months. It's his cough. Whenever he starts to work, he gets sick again. Is there somebody else working in the family? Joe. That's Johnny's big brother. He's got a little job, but it isn't enough. I work mornings in the restaurant around the corner. I start early, so I got time to take care of Johnny and the baby after school. How old is the baby? Going on six months now. She doesn't give any trouble. She's a very quiet baby. Where is your husband now? He's sick in bed in the other room. When he starts coughing like that, the only thing he can do is to lie down. Oh. Well, before I talk to you about Johnny, I'd like to ask you to come down to the health center tomorrow afternoon. Well, I can't do much traveling, and where is it? Two blocks down, across the street from the school. Why, it's near here. When do you want me to come? Anytime during the afternoon, and I want you to bring your whole family. You mean everybody? My husband, Joe, Johnny, and the baby? Everybody? Yes, everybody. And everybody came. At the health service the next afternoon, the entire family was thoroughly examined. I'm afraid your husband has tuberculosis. He will be a healthy man again only if you send him to a hospital. Well, rest, good food, and fresh air are the only medicines that can cure him. He must be put to bed immediately in a hospital. But we can't afford anything like that. We can hardly get along as it is. I know that. But the city will take care of your husband, and it won't cost you a penny if you can't pay. We'll lose the little wages he makes. But I suppose there's no other way. He's got to get well. There's more to it than just your husband. Do you know your children are undernourished? I do the best I can. Of course you do. It's a big job, and you need help. Everybody needs a little help sometimes, and we're here to give it to them. There's the office of the local welfare organization right here in the center. I'll take you up right now and introduce you to the lady in charge. An hour later, a woman was about to leave that health center. There was hope in that woman. Hope in a renewed start in life. Hope where there had been nothing but despair and the expectation of drudgery day by day to provide the barest necessities of existence. The woman's face shone with the joy of five lives reborn, and those were the lives of her family. And I want you to come on the days I told you. There will be classes that teach you how to take care of the baby, how to cook nourishing meals cheaply, and we'll keep checking up on the children. And my husband will be getting well in the hospital? I'm confident he'll be back on the job and will remain well, provided he follows the doctor's orders. You know, now maybe even Johnny will get good marks in school. You know, these health centers are really wonderful things. Okay, Fireboat Hewitt, sign off.

Dispatcher 53, signing off. You have just heard an actual radio roll call of New York City's fleet of fireboats and the whistle salute to his honor, the mayor. By means of two-way radio communication, the dispatcher has spoken in turn with each of the ten fireboats located at salient points throughout the city. Now, the man who is the chief of New York's Army and Navy of Firefighters comes to our microphone with a New Year's message for his firefighters and for the seven and a half million whose lives and property they protect, as well as the 578 miles of territory. The career of Fire Commissioner McElligot parallels 33 years of the Fire Department's progress. He started in 1905 as a fireman and in 1934 was appointed to his present post by Mayor LaGuardia, the first Fire Commissioner to rise from the ranks, Commissioner McElligot. You have indeed called up memories of the past. I hasten to add that my time in the Fire Department does not go back to 1867. But in 1914, I was a young captain in a hook and ladder company in lower Manhattan. You've just heard the roll call of the fireboats and I think we can truthfully state that New York City is leading the way in utilizing radio facilities. It is my hope that the time will come when every officer's car will be equipped with two-way radio and that our fire stations will also have this service. We of the Fire Department have been particularly fortunate in having for our boss a mayor who is at heart a fire buff. One of the very first improvements, if not indeed the first, that was started under the President's administration was the replacement of old and worn-out apparatus. We pride ourselves now in having the very best equipment that engineers have been able to design and manufacturers to build. Moreover, we have the kind of equipment which we want and not the type which a manufacturer might desire to thrust upon us. In other words, we prepare our own specifications. In order to give you an idea of the vast amount of this new apparatus added since January 1, 1934, let me recite the following. Ninety-nine pumping engines, forty-eight hook and ladder trucks, twenty-two hose wagons, ninety-one chiefs cars, thirteen hydrant service trucks, two searchlight cars, seventeen delivery trucks, and one rescue truck at a total cost of two million, two hundred and thirty-one thousand, nine hundred and thirty dollars and ninety-seven cents. So much for the material side of the fire department. You have already heard about the firefighter on this radio program, so I will not say anything more about that splendid vessel. After all, the best of apparatus is useless unless you have highly trained and courageous men to operate it. We have planned our educational program in the department so that today, the fire college in Long Island City is daily filled with officers and men taking special courses pertaining to fire extinguishment and fire prevention in all of its branches. The three-platoon system is being installed in the department, and a year from today, it will be effective in every company. Three hundred young men are added to our force every two months, and you can readily appreciate the additional administrative work that this installation has entailed. Yet I think it fair to state that because of a carefully prepared schedule, these new men are being absorbed into the department without decreasing our efficiency. By the terms of the new city charter, which became effective just a year ago, fire prevention was restored to the fire department, where, of course, it rightfully belongs. You may recall that because of a legislative act, this all-important work was temporarily transferred to other city agencies. Naturally, the time allotted to me here does not permit me to say as much about our work in the department as I really should like to. Our primary duty, of course, is fire extinguishment. But those of us in the department feel that we have a real obligation in earning the public's respect and cooperation. After all, it is your department, supported by the taxpayers, it is our duty to serve you. A safer city, the force of fire controlled in Czech, New York advances. Housing. A word of blueprints and architects of construction and planning. A dull word. Until you know its meaning in terms of people and their needs. Its meaning for one-third of the seven and a half million. Housing. I ain't getting any younger, men. I'd like to have kids around the house. We had to, didn't we? I know it ain't your fault. It ain't nobody's fault they died. Listen to me, Jim. What made those kids die? I guess it was just bound to be, men. Bound to be? It's the house we live in. It's the houses we've always lived in. It's these walls, these lights, no sun, no air, no decent food, and these stinking toilets. That's what it is. And you want me to have another kid and have him die when he's a year old? Or maybe if he's lucky, grow up to be a gangster like Two-Gun Crawley. No. Damn it, no! Hey, wake up. Come on now, man. Wake up. Four o'clock. You got all the sleep and you're going now. My turn now. Ain't hardly closed my eyes. Well, you better open up pretty quick. I got some fast sleeping to do. I'm sick. I'm going to sleep. What do you think I pay $3 a week for this bed for? Same reason I do. You get yours eight hours and I get mine. Bobby gets his. Come on now, get out of that bed. I gotta, I gotta sleep, I tell you. I gotta. What kind of thing is this anyhow? Twelve hours a day. Ten bucks a week. Sean, Mr. Nice, Sean, Sean. Boss, he don't want no Sean. But I want to sleep. I gotta sleep, you hear? Try and get myself a decent room where a man can lay his head when he's sick. Landlady tells me white folks live here, pay city dollars for this flat. Black ones move in. Forty-five. Same room, same busted banister, same lousy sink. By God, what kind of thing is this? Turn in the alarm. Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Crime, disease. A tragic trio, prayer of the tenements. These dramatic episodes were from Arthur Aron's famous federal theater play, One Third of a Nation. We think they vividly sum up the need for better housing. But what about the remedy? What is the city of New York doing to make home sweet home more than just a name to the one third of the city? From January 1st to November 1938, New York City's Housing Authority and Housing Department records these achievements. Demolition of 600 substandard buildings. Reports 69,163 violations of the housing law. The Housing Authority starts construction of two new housing projects. Red Hook in Brooklyn, Queensborough, and Long Island City. Low-rent apartments for 22,000 New Yorkers. But on the road to better housing for New Yorkers stands a formidable barrier. They say a man's home is his castle. Well, mine ain't. It's a dirty little cold water flat in an old Lord tenement. The kind they've been talking about tearing down. That's a swell idea. If they could do it. But it seems there's some regulation about how the city can't get federal housing funds if the cost of land is too high. So they can't build better houses in the slums. They gotta build them somewhere else. What good does that do me? No land purchased for federal housing projects may cost more than $1.50 a square foot. A ruling of the Federal Housing Administration. A stumbling block in the way of better housing. Then, one brisk afternoon in November, Brooklyn's Red Hook area is visited by a distinguished delegation. Mayor LaGuardia, Senator Robert F. Wagner, Nathan Strauss, United States Housing Administrator, Comptroller Joseph D. McGoldrick, and Alfred Reinstein, Chairman of the New York City Housing Authority. They are here to inspect the progress of the Red Hook Housing Project, a slum project begun before the land cost ruling. The visitors poke about among the building refuse, among the bricks and lumber, before they watch from a distance. Then, ha, ha, I'll say that. You'll see what's going on now. What's that? Oh, look over there. Why is there anything to get excited about? Yeah, maybe we can't get to it. Where a senator and a senator are sitting together on a wooden pile? Maybe they're having a conference. Not a wooden pile. A wooden pile? All right, so have your joke. Take a picture of me. It's so quaint. Why ain't nothing? I'd like to know what they're talking about. There's some sort of story, Bruce. Ah, they just passed the time of day. Come over here a minute, boys. That's the thing. Be right over, Your Honor. Watch out, Daniel. Trip all those timbers. I thought you boys would like to know what's been happening here. Sort of look like a conference. Yes, that's it. A conference on a wood pile. What's it all about, Mr. Mayor? It's good news about housing. Gentlemen, with the aid of Mr. Strauss and Senator Wagner, an adjustment has been made on an important housing problem. What do you mean by an adjustment? The adjustment was on the recent ruling by Mr. Strauss that land for federal housing projects could not cost more than a dollar and a half a square foot. Of course, you know that slum land is very expensive in this city. That meant we couldn't build any new housing projects in the slums. Well, does that mean the city will start some new housing projects soon? Absolutely. In fact, we've just decided on two large projects. The federal government is going to spend $12 million on one of them and the city will build another. That means we're going to be able to put a lot of the people of the slums into livable homes. Alfred Reinstein addresses the people of New York. Ladies and gentlemen, the Commissioner of Housing. 1939 holds great promise to new construction and rehousing in New York City. private industry is building or has projected even a greater volume of residential construction than was completed in 1938. We must insist upon sound construction to protect the investment, often the life savings of the small homeowner, and to avoid the rapid deterioration of neighborhoods. Public housing for the lowest income group is underway on a great scale. These projects must be well and economically built if planned for the elimination of slums and for rehousing slum dwellers are to succeed. That means Arizona, Saranac, or a place like that. Well, Doc, I don't have any money. Well, you'll be glad to know then. I'm sure that I've already arranged with the city authorities for hospitalization. It'd be silly to tell you not to worry, so I won't. But she'll turn out all right. The ambulance came and took me to the hospital. I was there for two months. Daddy used to come and see me all the time, and he said he wished he could send me to Arizona. That's a foul way to say. But the doctor says it ain't... It isn't, necessarily. He says they can take care of me right here in the world. I don't call anymore now, and they're going to let me out of the hospital soon, and I'm going home. You're even going to let me go back to school? Say, would you like to see the new doll I got for Christmas? The Department of Hospitals in 1938 waged an aggressive campaign against tuberculosis. Among the major achievements of the program was the start of construction of a new tri-borough tuberculosis hospital in Queens, which will provide 500 beds, and in addition, a Riverside Hospital, which will provide treatment facilities for 500 patients and new wards to house 110 beds. 1938, sees the addition of another significant chapter in the history of New York City Department of Hospitals. It is the story of a remarkable combination of science and of humanity. Ms. Donaldson, you've got to call them again. You must. This means a woman's life. I've tried them, doctor. There is no answer. Then call the Samson agency. They may have some donors available. I did call them, doctor. They say they have no passport donors available. Then phone doors that's cooperative. Then hurry. Yes, sir. How is she, Ness? Any change? Dr. Grayson says she can't last more than a few hours, unless she has the blood transfusioned. An hour? That doesn't give us any time. Yes? Yes, have they got him? They have a donor, type 4. Tell them to send him over here immediately. But it will be at least two hours before they can locate him. That's too late. All right, tell them to make it as quickly as possible. God, it isn't fair. It isn't right that blood, life-giving blood would be a matter of dollars and cents. Hello? Yes? Yes? I'll tell doctor. What is it? It's Dr. Grayson. He says to come up immediately. She's thinking fast. Blood transfusions, the old way, delays of hours, delays that often meant death. This year, New York City's hospital and department adapts a novel method of providing transfusions, economically and without loss of precious time. You wanted to see me, Dr. Heater? Yes, it's about your brother. There's no danger, is he? He's all right? Oh, of course. It's not a serious operation, but I want to talk to you about something else. Now, you're a strong, healthy-looking young man. Yes, there isn't any. It isn't for you and me, doc. I guess not. Well, the city's giving your brother hospitalization. Now, how would you like to help the city and others like your brother? How can I do that? By giving us some of your blood. You mean my brother's going to need a transfusion? Well, possibly. If he does, we'll have the blood ready immediately. If not, then we'll put your blood in the bank. In the bank? Yes. And this is the bank that pays interest in human lives. It's a blood bank. Here, will you take a look at our deposits? Bottles of blood. Ready at an instant's notice, for any emergency. It's stored in this refrigerator, chemically treated so that it will last. Now, this blood has all been donated by friends and relatives of our patients. That's a swell idea. Now, what do you say, young fella? Want to become one of our depositors? Sure thing, doc. It's an obligation, of course. Sure thing, doc. You can put my account down right now. The hospital for tuberculosis, the blood bank plan. These are only two of the many advances made in 1938 by the Department of Hospitals. For the rest of the story, we refer you to the Commissioner of Hospitals, ladies and gentlemen, Dr. S.S. Goldwater. When you think of the Department of Hospitals, remember this. The city of New York is unselfishly interested in every sick person who needs hospital care and who cannot afford to pay for it. An appropriate motto for the Department of Hospitals would be all for one and one for all. In five short years, under Mayor LaGuardia's administration, new hospital wards holding 7,000 beds have been authorized and most of them have been built. In its new welfare hospital, the city has the world's finest hospital for the care of persons suffering from long-continued illnesses. More than 4,000 doctors serve in the city's 27 hospitals without pay, and these doctors are constantly discovering new and better ways of treating disease. 95% of all the patients admitted that city hospitals are cured or substantially relieved. At Willard Parker, the hospital for contagious diseases that in the old days would have been called the Pest House, the recovery rate last year reached the miraculous peak of 99%. The hospital department of the city of New York reflects the generosity of our great city and is a symbol of the people's will to health and happiness. New hospitals, new methods of hospitalization toward a healthier city, New York advances. New York advances. Steel and concrete, crowds and subways, work, that's New York. Green lawns, trees and lakes, play, that's New York food. I remember the days when they used to call golf a rich man's game, but not anymore. As soon as March comes around, I'll be at it again. A subway ride up to Vincorff, and I'll shoot 18 holes on the municipal links. I guess that's almost as good as belonging to one of those fancy Westchester clubs. There are no sidewalks that's sizzling hot as well to be able to cool off at one of those municipal swimming pools. Weekends, we have regular vacation at one of those clean new beaches like Jacob Rees or Orchard Beach. Shuffle boarding, deck tennis, and then a dip in the surf to top it off. Gosh. I used to worry about the kids playing in the streets, speeding cars in the neighborhood. It's easy for children to go wrong in the slums. Then Mary and I found out about the neighborhood playground. Jack and Sally go there every day after school. We know they're safe now. I guess I'll never go to Switzerland or any of those places you see in the movies, but Central Park in summer is nice. Joe and I like to play tennis and sometimes go rowing on the lake where the funny pelicans are. And at night when the stars are out, we like to sit under the elms in the mall and listen to the Goldman Band. So Uncle Mike gives me a bike for my birthday. So what good does it do me? Mom won't let me ride it in the streets. Says it's too dangerous. Gosh, it was tough until they opened up that bike path in Queens. Boy, it's a peach. You can ride for five miles and there ain't any danger because they don't let any cars in. It's only for riding bicycles. One of the greatest recreational centers in the world, that's New York City with a park department that gives the seven and a half million tennis, golf, riding, swimming, baseball, music, and miles of parks and beaches that takes youngsters off crowded streets, gives them play centers. And here's the general superintendent, Alan R. Jennings, with his report of some of the department highlights of 1938. The past year shows a more than three-fold increase in recreational facilities over 1933. It records greatly increased use of all park facilities. The past year marks the completion of the reclamation of the Hudson River waterfront. The past year saw the finish of the job of making the site ready for the great New York World's Fair of 1939. Working with many other city, state, and federal agencies, we have constructed permanent improvements costing $50 million for the great Flushing Meadow Park, which will follow the fair. But most gratifying has been the improvement in child welfare in the past five years. 1938 had less than 4,000 arrests for juvenile delinquency. 1933, more than 6,000. In 1938, there were less than 7,000 children who sustained injuries in street accidents. In 1933, over 12,000. The answer? The children are using the playgrounds. So I am happy for this opportunity to join with the mayor and other officials of the city administration in wishing you all the best of all possible New Years and the hope that everyone will enjoy to the fullest the many opportunities for recreation which have been made available. And that your patronage will make the coming year one of the most successful on record in our annals. A happy new year from Robert Moses and his Department of Parks. A healthier, happier city through recreation, New York advances. The municipal roll call of achievement.
