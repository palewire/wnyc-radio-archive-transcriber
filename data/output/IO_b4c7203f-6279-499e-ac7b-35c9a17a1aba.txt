As part of American Education Week, the New York State Teachers Association presents transcribed The American Riddle. Johnny, wake up. I am. Johnny. What is it? Those men. Maybe the ones who were here the other day. We'll soon find out. The lights won't go on, Johnny. What the devil? They cut the fuse box down on the porch. Don't go down. Johnny, don't. It's all right, Terry. You're not back in Belgium. You're here in America. Please, Johnny. You stay here, Terry. Understand no matter what happens. Johnny, be careful. Be careful, Johnny. What the devil goes on here? Hey, take that flashlight out of my eyes. Maybe you would like this one better. You, eh, Tim? I see you brought along plenty of help, too. I told you the other day, Edson, that if you didn't make your wife apologize, we'd get her out of time. How much liquor did it take for you guys to get all this courage to drive out here a half mile in the middle of the night? I told you, Edson, that we'd be back if you didn't get your wife out of here. You said that once. Now get out of here before I lose my temper. Look at the big man before he loses his temper. Johnny. Here. He's the shotgun. Terry, I told you to stay upstairs. There she is, boys. What did I tell you? First, she says we're a dumb bunch of warmongering Americans. Now she wants her husband to shoot us. Spreading communist propaganda among our kids ain't enough for her. Tim, somebody's coming. This car. See that light? Come on, let's get out of here. We'll be back, Edson. But next time, you and your wife won't get off so easy. Come back sober, Tim, all of you. And we'll try to talk it out. Who is it, Johnny? I don't know, Terry, but I'm sure glad to see him, whoever it is. You all right, John? Oh, it's Mr. Akey. Roy, what? Yes, Roy, we're okay. Come on up. I got wind of what was going on from one of them who backed out. I came just as fast as I could. Any trouble? Well, there would have been if you hadn't come along. They were talking themselves into something. You know who it was? One of them, Tim Connors. He and Jake Devereaux and Frank Storrs were out here the other evening making threats to Terry before I got back from work. Probably the same ones tonight. They kept flashlights in my eyes so I couldn't see. My lord, that's the worst thing. Scare you, Roy? I thought maybe you'd sent them out here in the first place. Would I be here if I had? You sure hid. But you're right. It does scare me. Talking and fighting. And who knows what it'll lead to. My lord, I'm going to call a meeting. A meeting of the board tomorrow night. And I'm going to spread word around town and have everybody there that wants to be there. I'm going to see the things settled once and for all. Since you started this mess in the first place, I guess you'd better, Roy. Your wife here started it, Johnny. If she hadn't made that talk in Edna Allen's history class... Johnny, maybe Mr. Akey would like something. Mr. Akey would like some coffee. We cannot stay here on the porch. No, thanks, Mrs. Edson. If you folks are all right, I've got to be getting along. What are you going to do at the meeting, Roy? I'm going to give everybody a chance to speak his piece and get the air cleared. Maybe if this thing gets out in the open where everyone can look at it, there won't be any more of this. Think you can do it? Well, I've got the power as president of the board of education. But power isn't going to be the answer to this. No, you're right there. Well, I'm going now. You and Mrs. Edson be at the school at eight o'clock. Here? We will be there, Mr. Akey. This, it should have happened two weeks ago. It never would have happened at all if you hadn't sounded off about America. She did. It's too late now to cry about it, so let's clean things up. Well, that's how I feel. I'll see you tomorrow night. Roy. Yes? Thanks. I think your wife said some mighty wrong things, Johnny. I think Ed and Alan was doggone stupid to let your wife talk like she did to a bunch of kids. And I think you're a fool for not helping more to clear things up. But with all that, I don't think anybody, anybody at all, has a right to beat up a man for what his family says or believes. And that's why I came. But I still think you're wrong, both of you. Good night. Good night, sir. shoot it Just a bit aroma was gone all night A bukan, but this one... beginning of the school year, Edna Allen asked Mrs. Johnny Edson to talk to her kids in history class. Well, Mrs. Edson did, and said some pretty violent things, judging from what the kids reported to their folks. A lot of you brought pressure on me and the board to reprimand Mrs. Allen. Some of you have suggested that she be fired. That, however, is our business, and we'll decide it as we see fit. A good many others of you have taken it out on Johnny and Terry Edson. Johnny has already lost work because of the fracas. Nobody speaks to his wife anymore and other things not so pleasant. But what made me call this meeting was a bunch of you men driving out to Johnny's place in the middle of the night last night and threatening to beat him up. I figured then it was time to clear the air before things got so serious that somebody got hurt. Now, we're going to give everybody a chance to talk, but you're going to do it one at a time, and only when you're recognized by the chair. Now, Mrs. Edson, you were the one to start all this, so let's hear your story. Just what did you say exactly? Mrs. Allen asked me that I should speak to a class about Europe. I told the children many things, but what made some of them puzzled, perhaps? They weren't puzzled. They were sore, as any good American kids ought to be. Oh, no, no. Anger is not the answer. We must have reason. Well, exactly what did you say, Mrs. Edson? That in many countries, you Americans, we Americans, are greatly disliked. You tell them, Sarah. Tell them what she said. Well, she said Americans were dumb about other people and... No, I did not say dumb. I said ignorant. Americans have yet to learn so much about other people and other countries that they... We do many stupid things in our foreign relations. Many times we support men who are friends of the Nazi. We support totalitarian authorities because they tell us if we do not, the people then will join the communists. We transmit radio propaganda and the joys of freedom. What did I tell you, Roy? She's a commie just like all them Europeans. How did you make another crock like that about my wife and I'll... Quiet! Quiet, both of you. Go on now, Mrs. Edson. She said... She said if there was a war, it'd be our fault, too. Oh, no, Frank. That I did not say. I did say that many men here talk of war very easy because bombs will fall on Europe long before they fall on this country. I said it is easy to talk of war when it is not your family that will be killed. I said that people in Europe think that we talk too freely of war and that they are afraid Americans will do something that will start the war. Anything else, Mrs. Edson? No. See, Roy, it's just like the kid said. She called us warmongers and stupid fools. I say send her back to Holland or Belgium or wherever she came from. She don't like it here. Let her go back where she came from. All right. All right, Tim. You can sit down now. As I told you before, I called this meeting to clear up the air. Some of you tried to beat up Johnny last night. Probably would have if I hadn't gotten there in time. Now, nobody's broken any laws around here except you guys. You get liquored up. Some of you are as bad as a bunch of Nazis. You don't beat up a man because you don't like what his wife says. Now, I called this meeting so as Mrs. Edson could repeat what she said in Mrs. Allen's class so we could all hear it firsthand. Kids have a way sometimes of not knowing exactly what you did say, so they make it up a lot worse. You heard her yourself, Roy. It's just as bad as the kid said it was. In a way, yes. Yes, in a way. But that's why I want to give Edna Allen a chance to get up here and defend herself. Now, Edna, you know this isn't the usual procedure or anything like it. This really ought to be a closed meeting of the Board of Education. I'm happy that it's public, Roy. Well, you've taught here 18 years now. A lot of the folks out there took history from you. I guess the Board couldn't fire you without quite a squawk. So, you say your piece where everybody can hear. What am I supposed to do? Defend myself for inviting Terry Edson to speak in my class? No, Edna. I don't think it's a matter of defending yourself exactly. I guess we all just want to know why this happened in the first place. I'd like to stop this mess before it gets any deeper. It's serious enough now as it is. Well, am I supposed to defend my technique of teaching what Terry said or exactly what, Roy? I don't know exactly what I'm expected to say. Oh, you're making it hard on us, Edna. You are probably respected more than any other teacher this town has ever had. Yet you've done something wrong. We want an explanation. I'm not going to make any ridiculous threats. I don't have to. The town's got a right to know no matter how long you've taught here or no matter how good a teacher you've been. What did I do wrong, Roy? You let her for it. Terry is hardly a foreigner, Roy. Well, she's hardly an American either. She has her papers. Well, that doesn't make her an American. She's a doggone sight better American than you or I. She appreciates what... All right, all right. Go ahead, Edna. You were the one who was telling me. I don't feel like it wrong. You do. Tell me what it was. I let Terry Edson, the naturalized American wife of an American soldier, talk to a high school history class about European feelings toward the United States. And the fact that she reported critical things about us is wrong? Is that it? Not exactly. If Terry had reported only complimentary things about Americans, there wouldn't have been any mess like this, would there? No. So it's the criticism you object to, not my having her in class. Isn't that right? By Lord, don't you cross-examine me. You're the guilty one, not the board. You made a darn serious error in judgment in letting Mrs. Edson speak to your class, and we want an explanation. Now, if you're going to try to hide behind 18 years of teaching in this town, I want to make it clear that you can't do it. I don't care if you've taught here 50 years. When a teacher lets a foreigner come into her class and criticize this country and the people in it, then I say it's high time... You see, Roy. You always keep going back to that one point. Terry, in your mind, is a foreigner. That's your objection. That a foreigner criticized America. In front of a lot of kids who can't reason things out for themselves yet. A lot of kids get isms of all kinds fed to them every time they turn around. Americans, they can't stand criticism today, Edna. Things are too tense, too dangerous in the world. If we don't believe with all our hearts that the American way is right, we'll lose everything we've gotten. By Lord, I... Just a moment, Roy. You say things are too tense, too dangerous, that if we don't believe our way is right, we'll lose it. You're go-gong right. I believe that too, Roy. So does Terry. So does John. Then why in the devil did you ask, Mrs. Edna? Because today, Roy, more than ever before, we've got to make the younger generation see and appreciate and feel and understand what America is. And I suppose criticizing... Not criticizing, Roy. Careful thinking. Today is no time for blind, unreasoning faith that everything we do and think and say in this country is right. Today is time for careful, clear thinking. That's why I asked Terry to speak to my class. I've talked to her many times. I knew what she was going to say. I wanted her to say it. I'm glad she repeated it here tonight for all of you. Because she made the children think. And she's making you think about what this country is and what it stands for. And that's what we need. Not blind emotion, but reason. Roy, you or somebody asked Sarah Connors and Frank Devereaux to be here tonight to report on what Terry said in my class. Let me ask them to report on some other things they've learned in class. May I? Why, why yes, sure. Sarah, what's the highest mountain in the United States? Mount Whitney, California. It's nearly 15,000 feet high. What's the lowest point in the United States, Sarah? Death Valley. It's less than 100 miles away from Mount Whitney. And it's 270 feet below sea level. That fact doesn't hit you, does it, Roy? Or the rest of you? That here in America, you have a country so complicated that the nation's tallest mountain is less than 100 miles away from the nation's lowest desert. Frank, how many religious groups are there in the United States? Well, 256. And there are more than a quarter of a million churches. There are almost twice as many Protestants as Catholics, nearly six times as many Catholics as Jews, and 300,000 Christian scientists. Sarah, what do you know about the land and population in this country? Frank, what's unusual about the government in the United States? Well, there are more than 150,000 different units in our government. All the states have governments of their own, and they're bosses in many things. Yet when it comes to some things, they don't have anything to say about it, because the federal government's the boss. Sarah, do you know anything else about America? Oh, yes, Mrs. Allen. I know that almost 10% of all the people here were not born here, and twice as many that have one or both parents born abroad. And there are still more than 350,000 American Indians in the United States, and nearly 40 times as many Negroes. Frank, where do we get our food in this country? Well, more than half the people live in the cities, yet the whole country is fed by less than one quarter of the people who work on farms. And I remember something else you said, Mrs. Allen. In three states, you said there are more than 300 times as many people who don't have indoor toilets as there are people right here in Casper Valley. And don't forget what else Mrs. Allen told us, Frank, that in New York City, there are a thousand times as many television sets as there are people here in Casper Valley. All right, Edna. Those are all very interesting facts. Frank and Sarah did a very fine job, remembered a lot of things. But that don't mean anything. But they do, Roy. That's my whole point. The class didn't learn these as isolated, meaningless facts. They learned them only as part of a total picture. The total picture of the United States. Roy, and the rest of you, too. Do you know that if America didn't exist today, and if someone wrote about it as it does exist, no one in the world would believe it. It's the most unbelievable country in the world, filled with differences that are so striking that they're contradictory. Roy, think of all the differences. Just those between here and Casper Valley in New York City, for example, or between Texas and Pennsylvania, or between the cornfields of Iowa and the forests of Maine, and what people eat and how they talk, their jobs, their religions, the climate, the land. Think of those differences, Roy. That's what Frank and Sarah were doing. They were fitting some facts that show what a contradictory nation we are into the total picture of America as a nation. Edna, I agree with you. It is a complicated country. But get to your point. I told you before, Roy, that our most important need now is to think reasonably, to appreciate what we have. That's what I try to get across to my class. That's why I asked Terry to speak to us. Think of what this means, Roy. The United States, with more complex differences and extremes than any country in the world, is still a democracy, a republic. Think of that, Roy. A nation of impossibly mixed up bloodlines and culture, with everyone free to disagree with his neighbor or his boss or the president. Yet it is a united nation, Roy. Think hard about that, will you? It's a political impossibility. Three million square miles and over 150 million people united without the force of a dictatorship. Oh, darn you folks. If that fact doesn't amaze you and puzzle you, then you don't deserve the country you've got. Uniting a nation by controlling the press, the radio, the movies, the churches, the schools is simple. Unity in a dictatorship is nothing. It's the expected, the planned outcome. But a united nation of millions and millions of people, free to go and do and speak as they please, that's a fantastic impossibility. That's what we must understand, Roy. It's the greatest political miracle of all times that we are still free to govern ourselves. And we'll stay free only so long as we realize what a miracle our freedom is. That calls for careful thinking, Roy, about ourselves and our actions. That's why I asked Terry, encouraged her even, to pass along with criticisms other people have made of us. We get annoyed at Europeans for criticizing us, just like the people in Caskervalley have done with Terry. My goodness, why shouldn't Europeans and everybody else criticize us? They don't understand us. How can they? We're so complicated in this country we don't even understand ourselves. We just go along blindly believing in America. Well, that's not enough, Roy. We've got to know and understand what America is and show others so that they in turn will understand us. If we don't, we're going to be alone in a world full of jealous enemies. You, Tim Connors, and you, Jake Devereaux, and Frank Storrs, and Florence Ames, and all the rest of you out there, you came here tonight ready to hang me from the nearest pine branch, I guess. Oh, now, Edna, that isn't fair. It wasn't you we were sore at anyway. It would have been another day or so. Terry first, then me. Tim, you know, or you do if you have the brains you did when you were in my history class years ago, that everything Terry said is true. If the truth hurts your American pride, then you'd better start thinking. I've been sitting here, Edna, doing a lot of thinking. About what, Roy? About Mrs. Edson's talk in your class. You may have been right. I don't know. But, Edna, I doubt if high school youngsters can handle ideas as big as the ones you've been putting out. Now, maybe they can, but I think it's dangerous. Roy, you, above all people, should understand that it's only in our schools that we can make the young people think about America. You, above everyone in this room, should realize that it's only the school system that has made this country. You take all the differences I've been telling you about, all of them. And the only common thing that makes us think as a nation are the traditions and ideas that we teach in our schools. It's only in our schools, Roy, that the children get the knowledge that makes it possible for them to govern themselves later on. It's only in our schools that they learn the basic principle of equality. It's only in the schools that they get to understand what America is and what it means. All I'm trying to do is to make them understand that fact better because it's so important now. Look at us right here in Cascar Valley. Just take the differences that exist in this one small town and magnify them 1,000 times. And then you begin to see the country as a whole. Well, we've got those differences, Roy. But what holds us together? It's because we believe in our country as a nation. Because we think of it as a nation. We're tied together by a common history that we learn through a nationwide system of schools. Take away those schools. And in a single generation, there won't be any America. Won't all of you please try to understand what you've got in this country? Won't you try to before it's too late? I... I... I feel so old. And I've had a tiring day. I... I've done a lot of talking here tonight and I'm worn out. And I'm discouraged. I don't think I've made you understand. I'm sorry, Roy. Good night. Wait a minute, Edna. Mrs. Allen! Mrs. Allen! I think I understand Mrs. Allen. And Frank does too. Don't you, Frank? Yes, ma'am, I do. I really do, Mrs. Allen. That... That's all that matters. That you young folks and others like you understand. Thank you, Sarah. You too, Frank. Goodbye. Good night, Edna. And Edna. Yes, Roy? When you get rested up, my wife and I, we... we certainly would appreciate it if... if you'd come over to dinner some night. or... for... Ladies and gentlemen, you have been listening to a special dramatization, The American Riddle, presented by the New York State Teachers Association as part of American Education Week. American Education Week is sponsored by the National Education Association, the American Legion, the U.S. Office of Education, and the National Congress of Parents and Teachers.
