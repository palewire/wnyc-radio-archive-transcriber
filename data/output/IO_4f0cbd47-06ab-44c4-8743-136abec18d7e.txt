I think we may appropriately begin the exercises of the evening by reading a telegram from a person who is not only our cherished friend, but the spokesman of our sister society. I shall have another telegram to read at a later hour, but I begin with this message, which I am sure will be appreciated. President of the Pilgrims of the United States, the Pilgrims of Great Britain greatly appreciate the courtesy you are extending to our Chairman by welcoming him in New York on Columbus Day. Sir Camill has been a member of our Executive Committee for 32 years and has devoted himself to the cause for which the Pilgrims stand, closer cooperation and understanding between our two people. We recognize by this dinner that you are appreciative of his services, and we thank you most sincerely. Halifax, President of the Pilgrims of Great Britain. Now, the first speaker, whom I will have the privilege of presenting to you, is doubly welcome. He is welcome not only because of his personal achievements and of his familiarity with this country. He is welcome also as the representative of a great and friendly neighbor. He has behind him a variegated and a brilliant life in the Canadian Army during World War I. He is welcome. He has not only taught history, but he has made it and has been the collaborator in a series of international conferences that I would tremble to enumerate. And everywhere, the service has been marked by the utmost brilliance, accompanied by the greatest sanity. He comes to us, our great neighbor in the North, who sits there in a vast domain from ocean to ocean, from the bay to the mythical boundary of 49 degrees, looks out across the Atlantic to the motherland, and then over a boundary which affords no obstacle to sight or to communication. She looks with us down over the reaches of the Mississippi to the Gulf and beyond. I'm not going to make a speech on the undefended boundary, Mr. Ambassador. It's a very fascinating theme. Here these two people should lead, comrades in peace and companions in war and companions in peace, divided only by a mythical line, stretching from the Pacific to the lakes and down the lakes to the St. Lawrence and down the St. Lawrence to the sea. Many heroics have been spoken about that unguarded boundary. It not only has great potency as a symbol and a lesson, but like most historic events, it even has its comic occurrences. Of those, the one which always seemed to me the most comical was the year in which the United States spent over a million dollars restoring the fortifications at Ross's Point. And then, after that expenditure, surveyors came along and informed us to the great reddening of our faces that we'd spent all that money on the Canadian side of the line. It was a very discouraging incident. So I present to you, gentlemen, a man distinguished for himself, sympathetic with American and American ideals, and a representative of our great neighbor to the North. I present to you His Excellency, Mr. Lester Bowles Pearson, officer of the Order of the British Empire, Privy Counselor, member of Parliament, and the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs. Thank you. I would like to thank you, sir, in the beginning for the kind and generous thing that you have said about myself, over generous, though they were, and to assure you that there is no person whose good opinion I value more than yours. I would like to reassure you also, Mr. Chairman, that I am going to heed your advice and not make a speech about the undefended boundary between Canada and the United States. One disadvantage of the fact, however, that it is unguarded and undefended is that so many Canadians are able to escape from Canada because of that fact. Most of them seem to escape to this country, but not all of them. So, one of our most distinguished escapees is the gentleman whom we delight to honour tonight, Sir Campbell Stewart. We boast, of course, about our Canadian exports of wheat and hockey players and things like that. But we shouldn't boast about our human exports. And we don't boast about that because we regret and at times almost we resent the fact that they leave us. I don't know why they do. I suppose I should, Mr. Chairman, because once upon a time I left myself for Chicago. However, I spent a year there and I came back to Canada. And that is no reflection on Chicago. Sir Campbell, however, did not come back to Canada, at least, to stay in Canada. And I often wonder why these Canadians leave Canada and refuse to come back and live in Canada. I suppose it is due, in a sense, to the fact the distant pastures seem greener. But I would remind those, including Sir Campbell, who leave Canada, that once they leave Canada, then the distant pastures are in Canada. And there is no country where the pastures are greener than in my own country. At the same time, I don't know of anyone who had a better title to be the Chairman of the Pilgrims in London than Sir Campbell himself. He was born in Canada, but of Irish extraction, with a Scotch name, and now domiciled in England and being honored in New York. That seems to me to qualify him for the position which he holds in this, and indeed in other societies devoted to the strengthening of the relations between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. I have a personal debt of gratitude to Sir Campbell because when I was a struggling civil servant stationed in London for a good many years, he was most kind and helpful to me. And he used to give me good advice in those days, which he said, if I would only follow, I'd get along in the world. I'm sorry, I didn't follow it. I went back to Canada and I became a politician. In my present capacity as Secretary of State for External Affairs, and as the Chairman of the Canadian Delegation to the present United Nations Assembly, I thought, Mr. Chairman, that I might say a few words tonight, and they will not be many, about the current international picture as I see it. During every great conflict, and certainly we are going through a period of great conflict now, the thoughts and hopes of men everywhere have turned toward peace. It is faith in the chance, the chance to build a peaceful world which helps us, which helps to sustain the human spirit during its hour of trial. And I suspect that we are going through that hour of trial now. And happily, however, as Arnold Toynbee, among others, had reminded us, the hardest time to build peace is in the period immediately following a great war. It is then that the foundations of peace are least secure, that relations between states are most sensitive and difficult, and that the temptation is greatest to those who consider that the shortest way to solve international problems is to use force. And so it is today. There are moments indeed when, perplexed and baffled in our search for security and peace, and a chance to lead a decent progressive life, we look about us almost in anguish for reassurance that our task is not hopeless. Well, fortunately, there are reassuring signs to be found if we have the patience and the insight to look for them. And one of the brightest of such signs, one which gives us the greatest hope, is the new and strong partnership which in our time has grown up between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. There I am. This is, of course, an informal partnership, and that is according to our genius. In keeping with the nature of the democratic and indeed the pragmatic traditions of our three nations, it is complex, it is variable, and it is imprecise. It is easy to bend, but it's impossible to break. Each of us, moreover, and we should not forget this, enjoy the benefits of many other partnerships. The United States with the Organization of American States, the United States and the United Kingdom with the countries of Western Europe, Canada with France by recent of an ancient connection revived and confirmed on the battlefields of modern wars, the United Kingdom and Canada with the nations of our British Commonwealth, and we have no intention of losing that connection, and all of us with our partners in the North Atlantic community. And yet, though we have these special, these additional connections, there are particular opportunities and particular responsibilities which belong to our three nations because of geography and history, because... ... ...all of our common traditions and our devotion to certain basic concepts of life and liberty and the dignity of man. And I think that it is particularly important that at this time, at this very difficult time, we should examine our partnership as we face the realization that the security and the opportunity for progressive development, ...which we bought so dearly in the years between 1939 and 1945, is once again threatened by dark and evil forces of reaction. The structure of peace which we have been striving to build is being put to a stern test. So let us examine, re-examine our relationship to it. The urgent nature of our problem, and the measure of our danger, was of course brought out in sharp and clear relief, not long ago by the communist invasion of Korea. In a vague and general way, we who are particularly concerned with international affairs, had known that the group of international communists whom the Soviet Union had left in control in North Korea, ...were biding their time and preparing their forces for the day when they could grip and control the whole of that country. ...but we had not realized that they were prepared to attack so soon. And we did not foresee that this attack would be so direct and so brutal, and in such open and cynical defiance of the United Nations. When, therefore, it began, most of us, nearly all of us, were for the moment almost stunned. Any bewilderment, however, which the communists may have caused by their surprise was brief. And the reaction of the free world under the stirring and resourceful leadership of the United States was prompt and effective. By violent battle, the burden of which has been borne by the military forces of the United States, we don't forget that, ...the immediate threat has been met. But the general problem, however, remains, and the Korean War, the heavy red line which underlines it. How, on the one hand, are we to maintain the political and economic vitality which is the breath of life to the free world, ...and at the same time, guard ourselves against the determined efforts of the international communists, ...whose interest in this case, as in so many cases, coincides with the ancient objectives of Russian imperialism, ...from breaking in upon us, disrupting our way of life, and menacing our very existence. ...the response of the free world to these problems has recently been vigorous and effective. For our immediate security and for our common welfare, we have fashioned the North Atlantic Pact, ...and we are building the North Atlantic Community. There is still much to do in developing the defenses of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, ...but the course has now been marked, and the goals have been set. The last meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which took place here in New York just a few weeks ago, ...and which I attended, accomplished far more than any previous meeting. When the decisions which have been taken at that meeting have been put into effect, ...we shall have gone a long distance forward toward developing the North Atlantic Community into a far more effective security organization ... ...than anyone would have dared to hope for three years ago. But there is much that remains to be done. The foundation, for one thing, of the North Atlantic Community must be based on something more permanent ... ...than a military alliance in the face of a common danger. It must rest also on social and economic cooperation, ...on a growing feeling of solidarity and unity. We will not be successful as I see it. In achieving this result, if we cling to old concepts of national sovereignty, old fears, old prejudices, and ancient grievances. We in the North Atlantic world must strive to organize a new kind of collective life. One which, while preserving our separate values and maintaining our own domestic and national structures, ... ...will be based on the proposition that in defense, and in foreign policy at least, ... ...it is no longer safe to rely on competing units of free states in the face of the monolithic and centrally directed mass of communist imperialism which threatens us. We can move forward. We are moving forward to this objective in the North Atlantic Community, ... ...which we are building, I hope, into a cohesive and cooperating social, economic, and political force. Furthermore, under the shock of Korea, we have also at long last begun to use the international security machinery which we have available in the United Nations, ... ...and to strengthen that machinery against possible new emergencies. By an accidental circumstance of great importance, the Soviet delegates were absent from the Security Council when the Korean crisis broke in late June of this year. I don't suppose that, considered from the narrow point of view of the selfish objectives of the Soviet state, ... ...there has ever been an act in history so short-sighted as the Soviet decision to walk out of the meetings of the Security Council on the issue of Chinese representation. ...because this desertion gave the Security Council at least a brief period in which it was able to act in the Korean crisis with an effectiveness which would never have been possible if the Russians had been there. The men in the Kremlin who were responsible for the decision to take the Soviet representative out of the Security Council, ... ...and at the same time to launch a war in Korea, ... ...must certainly go down in the record of history as amongst the worst chess players of all time. ... ...and the Russians are supposed to be good chess players. We can't, however, always count upon such helpful mistakes. And with this in mind, that we are endeavouring at the present United Nations meeting to strengthen the General Assembly, ... ...which operates without the veto, ... ...and the second line in our collective security system upon which we may fall back if the Security Council is unable to accomplish the purposes for which it was primarily designed. And we are making progress to this end. Though after listening in the last two days to 29 speeches on the subject, ... ...I find the progress, Mr. Chairman, a little wearying and slow. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... One of opportunity and responsibility in this North Atlantic triangle is neatly symbolized by our currency, which now moves freely and easily between the dollar and the pound, but is certainly influenced by both. We know, of course, that our position, our resources, our interests, and our ideals are such that whatever the journey that lies ahead in world affairs may be, we must take it with you. We hope that you, and by you on this occasion I mean especially the United States, we hope that you will realize that it is occasionally difficult for us to keep up the pace which circumstances demand and which is more easily maintained by a great, long, striding power. There may even be occasional moments when the course may seem to us to be a trifle zigzag, but we know in Canada that the general direction is right and the goal is good. I wish I could define that goal in terms that would inspire us to achieve it. We need today that inspiration. We need a faith so rich and a courage so high that failure is made to seem unthinkable. I have not this gift of inspiration, and so I will end by merely quoting some words which I read recently and which I think put clearly the task ahead and the objective to be achieved. And those words were the following. In order that the human race may survive on this planet, it is necessary that there should be enough people in the world who do not have to fight each other, who are not the kind of people who will fight each other, and who are the kind of people who will take effective measures whenever it is necessary to prevent other people fighting. Well, Mr. Chairman, we in this great country, in the United Kingdom, and in Canada are that kind of people. May our partnership grow deeper and stronger. And in this great work, may we find more men to help of the caliber and the devotion of the one whom we are honoring tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. May I be, you know, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And we must, Thank you. On your side. Thank you. Thank you. You have become, Thank you. And gratitude, It is, It is a whole, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Thank you, It is, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, I do, In Obrig, No, May, I, Thank you,affe, And you, theme of history, but it's something to which as I grow older I attach an even greater importance. History is the depth and breadth against which we must set current events if we are to see them in perspective. As one who has for many years been intimately connected with a great newspaper, I am particularly conscious of the responsibility that rests on the press in these critical times. Shallow judgments, shoddy commentary, dishonest reporting may help circulation, but they are crimes for all that. And I would plead here as I and many of my colleagues strive in Britain for unwavering adherence to the highest standard of integrity in journalism and most particularly as regards the relations between our two countries. So much temporary harm can be done by ignorance, wantonness or malice and to so little purpose. And now for a last word on China. That troubled land is a problem to us all and here our policy has not always been identical. You continue to recognize one government while some of the Commonwealth and Britain have recognized the other. I personally have never admired the regime Chiang Kai-shek. But I must admit the response to our recognition by the other regime has certainly not been encouraging. Here again I should like to quote Mr. Truman when he said, we hope in particular that the people of China will not be disled or forced into fighting against the United Nations or against the American people who always been and still are their friends. These words are... These words are words that all can subscribe to. And no propaganda should be allowed to seek to divide us on an issue where there should be no disagreement. So let me tonight in New York conclude what I now have to say to you with these sentiments which I feel very strongly. We may at times disagree with you on the interpretation of events. We shall say so. We may disagree with you about methods. We shall say so. We may even disagree with you in matters of principle. We shall say so. And our disagreements will make newspaper headlines, not all of them well intentioned, throughout the world. But do not let yourselves ever be led to think that on whatever ultimate beachhead our future and the future of our children's children may have to be defended. You will look round and not find the British peoples at your side. . Mr. alm thanks. . After the two magnificent speeches to which we've listened, any words from the chair or from anyone else could only be an anticlimax. I think you will agree with me that we owe debt to both of our speakers for their candor and their inspiring words. We owe debt to our brother pilgrim for the ambassador they've sent to us. And you will agree with me, I'm sure, that the American pilgrims have never spent a more delightful or inspiring evening than this. You are now adjourned. Thank you. Thank you.
