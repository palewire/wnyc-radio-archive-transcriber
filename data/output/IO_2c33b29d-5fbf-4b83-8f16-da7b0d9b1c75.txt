Here the trampled Saxon-Omen, Saxon-Spearmen, Saxon-Omen, be they guys, or I'm, or Yolmen, they now fight the ground. Through the fall of thunder, flag we conquer under. The flag that tries not to fly, nor the law is all in thunder. From where the country needs us, he is brave as he who leads us. Honor sells how proud he has done. Freedom, love, and rise. Rockies, thieves, and glasses narrow, flashed with fear and slight of arrow. Fluid things of death or sorrow, death is glory now. Earl, a reeling, harkman, o'er, let the earth, gentlemen, cover. In a friend, a wife, a lover, tremble on the floor. Hands of life are risen, love for love is given. Freedom, love, and rise. In a world of gladness rhythm, e'er, let theinoziehen, of wrath, rejoice and greats at all. Men of holiday, young glory, would you win a name in glory? Cry for home, a life, a glory. A life for glory. A life for glory like gallies. Freedom, love, and rise. Amen. For their third and concluding number, the Glee Club presents Benny Havens, a ballad sung by sons of West Point for over a hundred years, and sung today wherever West Pointers gather. Come fill your glasses alone, and stand up in a row, to singing sentimentally, we're going for to go. In the army there so priety, from motion very slow, so we'll sing our grand very slow, so we'll sing our grand reminiscences of Benny Havens, O Benny Havens, O Benny Havens, O Benny Havens, O Benny Havens, O Benny Havens, O, to our kind old alma mater, our rock-bound highland home, we'll cast back men's home, we'll sing our grand home, we'll sing our grand home, we'll sing our grand home. May the army be augmented, so more than sea let's flow. May our country in the hour of me be ready for the fall. May our country in the hour of me be ready for the fall. May the time of the soldiers let the feet of the soldiers go. May the time of the soldiers go. May the time of the soldiers go. May the throne in love, in thy heart's name, for Benny Havens, O, for Benny Havens, O, for Benny many home. O, for Benny home. O, for Benny home. O, for Benny home. home. O, for Benny home.

O, for Benny home. From West Point, we conclude this quarter hour of song by the Cadet Glee Club, conducted by Cadet G. S. Harper, with Warrant Officer Barry Drews in Charge and Cadet W. S. Fisher, Pianist. On Tuesday, June 4th, at 10 a.m., the address of Secretary of War Patterson to the graduating class will be broadcast over station WNYC. This is Major Bill Hood speaking and returning you to the studios of the Municipal Broadcasting System. How wellutt? TheISS all over the world. And we live all happy together, no matter what race we come to, no matter what our religion is, God has given us that feeling that we shall continue to love one another, irrespective of our religion, our politics, as long as we are all good fellows together. I say in this great horror, in 300 years, it has developed, and it's been a thing of an inspiration for the whole world. Those that have never had the chance to see our great horror, highly come here to see our tall villains, our great manufacturers, our many things of the interest that help supply the good things all over the world. Oh, people, when the opportunity comes to you, kindly visit our horror. We are the horror of good-hearted people, good-natured people. No drive was ever started in the horror of Brooklyn that ever fell down. This horror has been generous in everything. War front drives, Red Cross drives, War front drives, cancer drives, and many, many others, because the people of Brooklyn were always generous, and they give, they give them out to this hunger, famine, all over the world. And I hope the world, and every time, won't take as advantage of ours, as has been done on many occasions, but love and enjoy the friendship, not alone of the borough of Brooklyn, but the good people that come from all parts of the world to make our country to make our country what it is today. And Brooklyn is one of the springs in our country that has developed, and we in Brooklyn are very, very proud that we are residents of this borough. I thank you. Now, Pete, you've committed a grave error. You haven't said a word about Greenpoint. Well, I wanted to be a little modest. I want to feel this way, that to me, Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world. It is a spot where I was raised and first seen the light of day at number 132 Eagle Street. Thanks be to God there was a Greenpoint. Thanks be to God that the light of day gave me my opportunity, and to the people of Greenpoint, I worked and worked the same as every other man and labored on the docks. I pulled lumber, I worked in the whole of business. I'm proud that I was a long shaman. I'm delighted to say that I work with men and I've done the same thing as every other man done, work for an honest living and thanks be to God for that. Thanks be to God As we stand here and look down historic Booth Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak for a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building housing of Borough President. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836 and then a depression set in and it lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years and then the building was finally erected in 1848. That's when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down and we're going to build $11.5 million Kings County Supreme Court building. Then you go down a little further and we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building we're still going to keep there and we're going to renovate the town of Newson. We're out of a car. In other words, thanks a lot. We're here at Brooklyn at Borough Hall. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges.

We go down a little further and we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building we're still going to keep there and we're going to renovate that and use it for a federal court. This whole Brooklyn Civic Center is going to be flanked on both sides by public buildings and right in the center of it it's going to be a war memorial and it's going to be a useful one instead of brick, lime, lumber, and cement. It's going to be in honor of the 327,000 boys and girls who fought in this war. And don't forget, Brooklyn supplied more than 327,000 and of your 39 states in the union. In this war memorial you're going to have an auditorium that holds 1,500 people and then you're going to have a room on the right where the trophies that our boys captured from the four corners of the world are going to be on display. Then on the left-hand side is going to be a room in bronze where the names will be inscribed of every boy and girl who made the supreme sacrifice. And downstairs this is very interesting and I believe you'll like it. We're going to have a room for each of the veterans' organizations which isn't anywhere in the city of New York. We're going to have the American Legion, the King's County, the Spanish War veterans, the Catholic War veterans, the Jewish War veterans. They're all going to be down there in that one building. So as any of these 327,000 veterans need assistance, they'll have a central location point to which to go. Thank you. I appreciate you very much, Mr. President, your busy life stepping by this way and taking a few moments. That was quite a celebration you had down with Hamilton Ferry, wasn't it? You want to say a word about that? Yes, that was a big thrill. I'll tell you a little about that. A ferry boat known as the Moran Tugboat Company supplied it as a company. He lives in Brooklyn and he's a resident. I wonder if we can pick up somebody here, will you? I shouldn't say pick up, that's the wrong term. You come out, I was walking across the square with Pete McGinnis on my very athletic young man shook hands with him and he says, how are you?
