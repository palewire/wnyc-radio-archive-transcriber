The End I see. And we here at the newsroom have a later report, supposedly originating with the police department at the scene, that 33 persons were removed from the plane before it went down, and that a 34th, the captain of the commercial airliner, has been rescued by still another police launch. Do you have any information about that, sir? We haven't as yet received any reports from our launchers at the scene. I see. They're out of an emergency and they're working and they can't give us a full report until they've completed their job. All right. Can I call you back, say, in about 20 minutes or so? Well, call me back and I'll give you any information we have at that time. All right. And your name is what, please? This is Patrolman Shortell. Patrolman Shortell.

Will you run out one minute, please? I certainly will. I got, uh, looking at YC on the line. Well, uh, what did you want to know, sir? Well, was there anybody there who might have seen the plane go down? No, it was, it was foggy. It was a haze. Nobody saw it. The man, uh, the plane was coming in on finals. It was a, uh, instrument landing. On an instrument landing. From Boston, I understand. And, uh, did you hear anything? Pardon? Did you hear anything at your office? No, we didn't. Well, we just got an alarm. We got the call from the tower that he went down. It was in the water and out we went. And I thought he couldn't see anything. Uh, what, uh, what went out? When you say out we went. I mean, what, uh, pieces of equipment? Uh, wait a second now, please. All right. You want to know what people are doing now? Uh, New York City police launch went out and, uh, several small boats around there. I see. Into the bay, please. Is the, uh, police helicopter at the field now? Uh, he's not at the field. He's over at the scene now. He's at the scene? Yeah, over at College Point. College Point. Where they brought the survivors. Do you have any phone number or headquarters established out at College Point? Uh, wait a second now. Listen, we don't have any numbers. It's, uh, New York, New York City police probably could help you on that. Yeah. It's Marine 12. Marine 12? Yeah, they're Marine Bay. You can ask them. Marine Bay is 12? That's right. All right, thanks very much. Okay, thank you. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.

Hopefully you're all right or we can help you. Well, can you give me the phone number of Marine Base 12? Yeah, I don't know how you're going to get it out there, though. You'll never get it. Well, we can... Maybe I can help you out. What information do you want? Well, I want to see if I can get in touch with the police pilot of the helicopter who flew over the scene. I see. See if I can get in touch with you. I understand he's at the base over there. Yeah. Well, that number is Flushing 95388. Flushing 95388. That's right. Yeah. I was just trying to wonder what his name was, but I don't suppose you know. His name is Woodward. We call a fellow named Woodward. I don't know who the operators are. Mr. Woodward. What is that number that went down there that's close to the place? Well, I'll tell you that's what I've watched. You put it down there before you get an average. I don't know who the operators are. That's the air base. And the other one, Flushing 95388, is Marine 12. And the guy's name is Woodward? He's at the airfield. That's right. He might have went with the plane. I don't know whether Woodward is a navigator or what. Oh, I see. Mr. Woodward, is he a patrolman? I believe so, yeah. That's right. Uh-huh. All right, I'll try both of them. Thanks a million. Yes, well. Right, bye. Aviation Bureau, Patrolman Roney. Uh, Patrolman Roney, this is radio station WNYC newsroom calling. Yep. Uh, is the patrol helicopter that flew over the crash scene of the commercial airliner in the East River back at base yet? No, I believe they're out of LaGuardia now. They're out of LaGuardia? Yeah. I just phoned LaGuardia, and they told me it possibly would be at the air base. No, it wouldn't be back here. It would be somewhere up around the scene. Can you give me the name of the pilot of the plane? Yeah. Yeah, acting sergeant Harold Behrens. B-E-H-R-E-N-S. B-E-H-R-E-N-S. Harold? Harold, yeah. Behrens. Yep. Uh-huh. And did he have a co-pilot? Yes. Thomas Williams. Thomas Williams? Right. And he is a pilot? A co-pilot. Co-pilot. Right. A patrolman, is that? Thomas Williams? That's a patrolman, Thomas Williams. All right. And Marine 12, is that the same number as you have there? Is it Flushing 95388? Would it be over there, do you think? No, that's at College Point. That's at College Point. That's right. That's at Police Point. So I might be able to reach him over there, possibly. You might. I've been trying for a long time. You couldn't do it. Is the line busy over there? Oh, yeah. All right. Well, we'll keep on trying. Thanks a million. One of your, well, what's your latest list on these survivors? Well, we had 33 reported and three missing. Three missing, huh? Yeah, and there were 36, and that 36 had been reported from about two or three sources. Wait a minute. Jules, anything later on there? Yeah. What do you got? The most 33 persons have been saved.

Well, there's 33, two hurt badly, and there are three missing thus far. That's what I understand. Yeah. I understand, yeah. Okay, sir. Thanks very much. Right. Right. Hello, this is WNYC radio station Newsroom. Who is this, please? Uh, this is Captain Jensen speaking. Captain Jensen? Uh, that's all right. Where were you this morning, sir, when that plane crashed in the East River? Well, we were probably about a thousand feet away at the time. We were at our stake boat. We have a stake boat out here that we used to moor our scouts to, and I was tied up there waiting for the tide to come up a little bit more to get two sand scouts into flushing. I see. And what happened? So when she crashed, we were right there. Uh, what happened? And we came right out to the plane right away, but, uh, we had a little tough time driving us through the mud there. It's about half tired, see? Yes, I see. Well, we finally made it and got the tug right up to the plane, and I'll come back. What happened when you got to the plane? Well, when we got there, there was, uh, people, uh, holding onto the wings of the plane and the fuselage, and then there was a crash boat, uh, from, uh, the, uh, some airplane company over here in College Point. Edo, I guess they called it. Edo. And she got there just ahead of us, right in front of us, and, uh, they were taking people off because I couldn't maneuver the tug much around there, and we had the tug up to the plane, uh, the wing, wing of the plane, and we were taking the people off the wing. I guess we took off about six people, I guess. And this crash boat, he got in close to, close to where the other people were hanging on to the fuselage, and, and then he transplanted them to us. I transported them to us, see? And then we put them inside where it was warm and gave them blankets and coffee and things like that. Come back. How many people did you take aboard your ship altogether? That's right. Hello? Come back again, please. I said, how many people did you take aboard your ship altogether? We had, uh, 26 men and five women. 26 men and five women, that would make 31, is that correct? That's correct. And, uh, would you say there were about three or four or more taken aboard the other ship? Uh, no, we, we, uh, we had them all. We had them all. They, they put them all, all aboard us, as far as I know, the 31. But, uh, the two pilots, uh, we left on the plane, and they were chopping a hole on the top of the plane to see if there was anybody else left in there, you know? Come back. Well, we have a report here that as of now, 34 have been rescued and two are still missing. Over. I see. Well, that's about right, I guess. Uh, that's about right. Uh, because, uh, pilots, they said they figured there was two people in the plane yet, you know? Come back. What was the reaction of the passengers after you picked them up? Very good, very good, except that, of course, there were a lot of them, most of them all was suffering from shock and exposure. The water was very cold. It was lucky it was a warm day. But, uh, they were all, uh, shivering, and, uh, some of them was, uh, injured, uh, too. I mean, cuts and bleeding. And, but they did a magnificent job. Uh, no excitement or no hysterics or anything like that. And, uh, these five women, we, they were wonderful. They, they, uh, they didn't get hysterical or anything. And they were, they were pretty badly injured, some of them, too, by cuts and bruises, you know? Come back. And, uh, what happened when you reached College Point? Well, we came over to College Point with them just as soon as they could. And we called the Coast Guard across from the police department so they'd have ambulances over here to, and doctors. So we got in here just before, well, before the doctors got in. The doctor got in here just about five or ten minutes after we got in, and then the police department and all was here, too, because this is a police station right here at College Point Ferry. Come back. Are you at College Point right now? That is correct. We are at College Point Ferry. I see. And, uh, how many other people are aboard your tug besides yourself? Oh, there were about nine more people aboard. Our general manager, our general manager, is aboard now, but there was about nine men aboard the tug when the accident happened. Come back. And they all helped to, uh, rescue the people from the airplane? That is correct. We threw life preservers to the ones that we couldn't, uh, come to right away. And then we threw even lines and, uh, pulled some of them through the water there so they got aboard the boat and they all come back. Did you have any facilities for, uh, uh, medical aid to those who were injured? In other words, did you have blankets and other facilities aboard your tug? I tried. We had plenty of blankets and we gave them blankets and we gave them hot coffee and, uh, and put them in where it was warm in our galley and in the engine room and down our focus hole, which was all nice and warm, but, uh, they were exposed to that, uh, cold water and it was, some of them was pretty well shot, you know. We had to take two across, uh, ashore and stretch this to the police boat. Come back. In other words, uh, there are possibly two of those you rescued who are really seriously injured and the rest are not too seriously injured. Is that correct? That is correct. I don't think any of them are too seriously injured. All right, sir. And, uh, you are aboard the tug Bill Ender, E-N-D-T-E-R. Is that right? That is correct. And your full name is what? Captain? My name? Yes, sir. Your full name? Uh, my full name is E-A-R-L-E-R-L-G-E-N-S-E-N. And are you from New York City, sir? Uh, Flushing, Long Island. You're from Flushing. And how long have you been on a tugboat or Captain on a tugboat? Oh, for about 28 years. Twenty? 28 years. Would you say you had anything similar in your past 28 years? No, I haven't. No, I haven't. I've rescued a few people from drowning that are single people. And, uh, and, uh, excursion boat up in the North River here when I was working for McAllister here a few years back. Uh, broke down. We, uh, put her into our birds and got some of the people off. But that's about all, I guess. I see. Where is the, uh, wreckage of the plane right now as far as you know? Why, it's about abreast. Almost abreast of College Point Ferry between College Point Ferry and Rikers Island. Was it, uh, towed out of the way or is it, uh, the same place where it crashed? Oh, it's in the same place as where it crashed. I see, sir. And as of now, what is happening at College Point? Can you tell me that? Well, uh, right now, of course, uh, the ambulance are all gone and the people, I mean, uh, the people that were rescued are all taken off now. And, uh, they're, they're in the hospital by now. And, uh, the boss says that the police around yet, uh, the police commissioner himself was here a while back when, right after the accident happened when we brought the people in and he went out on a police boat. And, uh, they're right now out to the wreck, which I can see from here while there's Coast Guard out there and a number of police boats. And I think somebody from the DA is out there now, too. Come back. I see. In other words, various officials of, uh, different departments of government are at the scene at the moment. Is that correct? That is correct. All right, Captain Earl Jensen, thanks very much for giving us information about this plane crash of a commercial airliner this morning in the East River off Rikers Island. Thank you very much, sir.
