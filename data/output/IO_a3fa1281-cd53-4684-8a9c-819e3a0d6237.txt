There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I see. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born, sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Come, rat, come, rat, come, rat, come, rat, come on, say, who, how dare I be kind. When they just read us, my darling old comrade, what's there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken, and a mother's heart have broken. There is just another missing from the old home well before. There is still a memory living There's a father of the heart in vain And a picture that is true For the world She's my sweetheart, I'm her boy She's my honey, I'm her boy Good real valley Never up to far With a honey to me It's my sweetheart One evening in the month of May I met old Satan on the way I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die If you want to get to heaven in the good old way Johnny, get your gun, get your gun Roll it on Roll it on, roll it in Roll it in Johnny, get your gun Get your gun from his point Roll it on Roll it on, roll it in Roll it in Johnny, get your gun Johnny, get your gun Johnny, get your gun Johnny, get your gun, get your gun The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End
