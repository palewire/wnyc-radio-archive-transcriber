You may have read or heard recently that New York University has embarked upon a long-range development program. Today I should like to take a few minutes to comment on our plans. But first, I should like to thank the management of WNYC for making it possible for me to talk to you. Last month, we at NYU announced the beginning of a 10-year program to improve and expand our educational and physical facilities. We set the sum of $102 million as our goal. Of this amount, we estimate that $52 million will go into the construction of buildings and $50 million will be added to the university's endowment. Now, we know that the total is large. It is probably the largest publicly announced development program in the history of privately supported higher education. But we believe our goal is both realistic and reasonable. There are two points concerning this program that I want to emphasize. First, I want to make it clear that our purpose is not to expand in size, not to grow bigger. It is rather to augment existing facilities and to improve our educational programs. These things we must do to meet the growing demands upon our educational and research services and to make sure that the university may contribute to the future even more fully than it has contributed to the past. A university, like any institution, or for that matter, any individual, should seek continually to improve itself. It should make careful continuing studies of its objectives, its methods, and its procedures. When these studies indicate that improvements can be made, then these improvements should be made. Then, too, a great university must be dynamic. It must stay in step with the newest developments in all of the fields in which it is interested, the sciences, the arts, the humanities, business, and technology. And it must keep flexible enough, physically and financially, to go on advancing. We have made a realistic survey of the needs of New York University, and we have arrived at what we believe is a reasonable sum of money to require to meet these needs. We could have gone higher, justifiably, than $102 million. But we decided to keep our goal a fairly conservative one, one that we believed would be attainable. Now, the second point I want to emphasize is this. Our current program is not a drive. It is not a short-term campaign for funds. It is a program that will take years. We have no illusions about the task we have set for ourselves. We know that it will require the work of all of us at NYU, day after day and month after month and year in and year out. I am sure that some questions have arisen in your mind, questions that have not been answered specifically in the newspaper accounts of our program, even though many of these accounts have been quite thorough. I think that I can answer many of your questions by telling you a little about New York University, about its history, its accomplishments, and the job it is doing today. NYU was founded 121 years ago, in 1831. At that time, there were only 25 universities and 34 colleges in the entire country. And most of these were universities and colleges in name only. They were aristocratic and highly selective, training young men for the ministry and largely ignoring almost all of the other professions and occupations. The founders of New York University, merchants, clergymen, physicians, bankers, lawyers, had different ideas about education and its responsibilities and its future. They believed, first of all, that higher education should reach every qualified man and woman in the nation, regardless of his background. They saw wisely that the democratic ideals, which were the heart and soul of this young republic, could be realized only by an enlightened citizenry. They were convinced that the rich material resources of America could be developed only if the human resources were developed first. Secondly, they believed that higher education should concern itself with all the fields of useful knowledge, that it should provide for the needs of merchants, manufacturers, mechanics, farmers, architects, and engineers, as well as those of doctors, lawyers, and theologians. They felt that the best place for a university of this type, for this new kind of a university, was here in New York. In the rapidly growing metropolis of the new world, here it could serve great multitudes of people. Here it could use the city itself as a laboratory, thus bringing together theory and practice in education, perhaps as they had never before been brought together. And here, finally, it could offer to the city and to the people many fine services beyond those of its formal educational programs.
