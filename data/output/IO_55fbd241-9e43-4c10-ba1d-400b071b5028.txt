Well, thanks very much, Mr. Savage. I really would like to tell the people of the city of New York to be a bit more careful when they come to the midtown area. In fact, in any area of the city, cross with the lights and not do what this gentleman I just described doing, crossing in between intersections. Because not only did he bring injury upon himself and anguish and heartaches to his family, he caused quite a bit of traffic snarl there, too. Police Commissioner O'Brien says, with the approach of the Christmas holidays, conditions in our streets are bound to be aggravated by the unusually heavy number of shoppers and by an increased flow of vehicular traffic. Therefore, he has directed every member of the police department, in conjunction with the Traffic Safety Bureau, to intensify our year-round safety campaign at this particular time. But our people must help, too. The Police Commissioner further pointed out that from Christmas Eve to New Year's Eve, last year inclusive, 17 persons were killed and 706 injured in 564 accidents. This represents, as he says, a sad holiday for too many of our people and is an unpleasant picture. But it is part of the accident record. In recent orders to the department, the Police Commissioner ordered members of the force to distribute circulars to the public and populous areas of the city, advising them very pointedly to take it easy. Otherwise, your life or someone else's may be in danger. Thank you.
