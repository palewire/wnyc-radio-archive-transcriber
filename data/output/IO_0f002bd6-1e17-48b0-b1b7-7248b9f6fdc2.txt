Great somebody's a-goin' to rob them, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? What for? What for? I've got a lot on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that are tied, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing. And nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my tongue, my head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gals, got my lor, got my lor, got my tongue. I've got plenty of nothing. I've got plenty of nothing. I've got plenty of nothing. I've got the sun, got the moon, got the people see. The folks with plenty of money, got to pray all the day. Keeps with plenty, you're not the worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of life. Never want me long and not well. Never want to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm the boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing. And nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my tongue, for heaven's a whole day long. Do you complain it?
