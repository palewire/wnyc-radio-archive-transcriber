The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay And near the江 your town I am near at the front to fight the foe. The older boys are marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling, goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, follow this, it won't be long. We're on our way, hip hip hooray. We're going down south hooray. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I've hungered. Wandering, darling, is your true? Distance only lands and shuns then. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother. Just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over. Yes, she is here. Christ has been here. When the sun gets flowers blue. He dies so free. He dies so free. You will see the word you say. You will see the word you say. That's the time we do shall wear. When the harvest days are over. Just be near. My just be near. My just be near. My just be near. My just be near. My just be near. My just be near. My just be near.

All the boys and all the girls, they love and show. Though it's jolly, I'll let it through my home. Here's the sunshine of paradise, honey. Two little girls in blue, lad. Two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad, who won your father's home, became your mother, I married the other. But we have drifted apart. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I too. Come, lad, come, lad, ever since we were born, Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Comrades, when manhood was morning, they blew all their eyes behind. When danger's precious, my darling, old comrade, was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken, and a mother's heart have broken. There is just another thing from the old home that we belong. There is still a memory living. There's a memory living. There's a memory living. There's a memory living. There's a memory living. And a picture that is found. For the world. There's a memory living. Where the students look despite. And a memory living. He didn't go along. He didn't go to the hill, the Dee. And a excitement living. And a reallyuty. Form as a memory living. I'm a ghost. No. The symbolic history you saw. It here's the catchy that I never said. I'm a ghost. Hey, don't cry. There, I'm a ghost. I'm a ghost. When you're happy! You're my này, I'm a ghost. Give her a little bit, give her a little bit. One evening in the month of May, I met old Satan on the way. I looked old Satan in the eye, if you want to get to heaven when you die. If you want to get to heaven in the good old way. Throw it on, throw it on, throw it on. Throw it on. Throw it on, throw it on. Throw it on. Throw it on. Donnie, get the gun. Donnie, get the gun. Donnie, get the gun, get the gun. Donnie, get the gun. Donnie, get the gun. Donnie. Donnie. Donnie. The End The End The End The End Makes my happiness complete Makes me fodder at your feet Sweet Marie Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that style? Isn't it the knobby one And just the proper style? I'd just like to have one Just the same as that Where'er I go they come Hello! Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir Say au revoir Say au revoir Say au revoir But not goodbye But not goodbye But not goodbye The past is dead The past is dead Love cannot die What were you doing? We're better far Had we not met I loved you then I loved you yet Baby, baby Give me your answer too I love crazy For the love of you It won't be a styling marriage I can't afford a family But not goodbye But not goodbye But not goodbye But not goodbye I think so good For true When you hear The rest of things in me For joy, love And praise me You must sing And when the birds stand through In the forest of the night Is there real hot time To your ground tonight I can't afford it When you hear The rest of things in me For joy, love And praise me You must sing And when the birds stand through And when the birds stand through And when the birds stand through And when the birds stand through In the forest of the night You'll come to die We'll come to die For the night To die To die
