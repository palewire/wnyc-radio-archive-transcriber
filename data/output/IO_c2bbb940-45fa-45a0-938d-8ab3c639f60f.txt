The following broadcast was transcribed earlier this afternoon. From the Harlem Welfare Center on Park Avenue between 131st and 132nd Street in Manhattan, your city station brings you the special broadcast of the dedication ceremonies for this latest Department of Welfare project. The newly completed Harlem Welfare Center is the first city-owned structure designed and built solely to serve the specialized needs and to facilitate the efficient service of New York City's Department of Welfare. Participating in the dedication of the Center this afternoon are Mayor Vincent R. Impelletary, Robert F. Wagner, Jr., President of the Borough of Manhattan, Mr. Albert H. Morgan, Deputy and Acting Commissioner of the Department of Public Works, representing Commissioner Frederick H. Zermulin, and Lester B. Granger, Executive Director of the National Urban League and past President of the National Conference of Social Work. To introduce the program and the speakers, here now is the presiding chairman of the ceremonies, the Honorable Henry L. McCarthy, Commissioner of the Department of Welfare. It gives me great pleasure to welcome you here this afternoon for the dedication of the new Harlem Welfare Center, the first building constructed by the City of New York exclusively for the use of the Department of Welfare in serving the people of this community. We will open our program by having the flag raising, which will be conducted by the color guard of the 369th AAA Group, the New York National Guard. Captain Richard T. Jones, commanding.

The invocation will be delivered by the Right Reverend Monsignor Cornelius J. Drew, pastor of St. Charles Catholic Church in Harlem. The End Because after all, it is you who provides us with the rich resources whose surplus we share with our needy neighbors. Because it is you who inspires us to be generous to our brothers in gratitude for thy goodness to us. Because it is you whose wisdom is needed to direct those who must balance justice and mercy in the distribution of what can mean so much to so many. Amen. Thank you, Monsignor Drew. I think nearly everyone who is here today, and especially those who come from this area of the city, will know that Monsignor Drew, as pastor of St. Charles Church, has been doing a wonderful work in this area. And that he plans to do even greater work through the construction within a short time of the St. Charles School and Community Center for bringing better and more service to the people of the whole community. We wish him well in that endeavor. This is where many of our activities were carried on in the past, and we have gone into newer and more modern, up-to-date locations. And this is, of course, the newest and the most modern, the most up-to-date, and the most efficient of all of the plants that we have throughout the city. This is the beginning. We are going to have, and we now have in the planning stages, additional welfare centers. The next one, far along in the planning stage, is for Brooklyn. I think this is appropriate because it is a recognition of the fact that public assistance is recognized as an integral part of that entire network of protection, which we, as a people, have set up for the protection against economic hazards of all of our people. We have the protection of the federal old age insurance program for those who can work. We have the protection of unemployment insurance for those who are temporarily unemployed. We have the protection of workmen's compensation for those who are employed and who may be injured while they are employed. And then for those who can't work, who can't come under and be eligible for the benefits of all those protections, for those who, through no fault of their own, are in need, we have, as an integral part of this network of protection, the public assistance system which is administered by the Department of Welfare. Now we have, in the Department of Welfare at the present time, some 8,000 employees, serving 280,000 people in this city who are in need of assistance. That 280,000 represents a percentage of the total population of the city, which is just about the same as the national average of those who are receiving some form of public assistance. We have the aged, we have the blind, we have the disabled, and we have the children. And we have those who are temporarily ill and do not have unemployment insurance rights, or temporarily unemployed and who do not have unemployment insurance rights. Now the load at the present time is pretty stable in terms of the long-run cases those who, through no fault of their own, cannot support themselves and who must be taken care of by the community at large. We are, as I say, very happy to have this fine building, four stories, efficiently laid out, and ready to serve the people of the community, all the people of the community, in terms of our regard for the taxpayer's dollar, and in terms of our regard for the need of those who come to us for help. And we have a number of distinguished guests, some of whom are going to speak this afternoon. And there are too many distinguished guests, commissioners, deputy commissioners, heads of departments, and distinguished citizens of the community for me to try to introduce each of them. I will, however, introduce those who will speak to you. And the first one that I will introduce is a man who is here very fittingly on two counts. One is that he is the son of the father of the Social Security Act, which is, of course, the parent law under which all of our programs are administered. And then on the second count, in his own right, he has been a distinguished public servant and has given greatly of himself to the people of the city as a whole and particularly to the borough of Manhattan. And it is my great pleasure to introduce to you the Honorable Robert F. Wagner, Jr., President of the Borough of Manhattan. Mr. McCarthy, Mayor Impeletary, distinguished guests and friends, it's a great privilege and pleasure for me to come here to play a humble part in the dedication of this beautiful building. And I know, too, that when we start out our ceremony here with a prayer to God to assist us in the many problems that we face, we do that in the spirit of true democracy and the spirit of the religious principles which are so important in these troublesome times. I know many of us feel that sometimes progress is slow. Many of the things that we seek to make life a little better don't come as quickly as we anticipate or hope for. But here today we have a classic example of a beautiful building that will give comfort and aid to those who come to it in need of that comfort and of that aid. We know that we have, as the Commissioner has said, an assistance program devised to give every one of our people, regardless of their race, color, or creed, the benefits of democracy and the assistance that democracy has and should give them. We know that we have good housing projects being developed not only in this great area of our borough, but throughout our whole city. We know that our schools are slowly but surely being improved so that our children will give the very best advantages of a good education. We know that added recreational facilities are continually being given to the people for their comfort and their enjoyment. And I know all of us in this area and in the borough appreciate these things. And we realize that the city is doing everything possible it can to make life better here as a place to live in and to work in. And here today we again demonstrate democracy at its best, our city at its best, giving to its citizens the help which they deserve and they need. Thank you very much, Commissioner, for allowing me to participate here today. I know this is a momentous occasion for all here and for all of the people of this great section of New York. Thank you very much. The National Urban League is known as one of the great civic organizations throughout the country. Its work has to do with improving relations between the different groups in the community and protecting the interests of those who might suffer if they did not have a strong spokesman and a strong interest on the part of the staff of the league speaking for them. So it is a special pleasure for me to introduce to you Mr. Lester B. Granger, who is the executive director of the National Urban League and who I know is as happy as we are today at the dedication of this building. Mr. McCarthy and Alan Pelletary and fellow occupants of this exposed situation, I am happy to be here because it's a great thing to be in a group like this and to witness the fulfillment of a dream. And that's exactly what we're witnessing here today. And when I say fulfillment of a dream, I don't mean merely the dedication of an imposing pile of brick and cement and steel. It is important that this building, which we've just dedicated, is here in New York City, as the Commissioner has said, the first city-owned and first specially planned center for the administration and the supervision of public welfare programs. But to me, the real importance of this occasion lies in the fact that today is the fulfillment, in more ways than one, of the hopes and the dreams of our leaders, of our community, for the past two decades. Because this building indicates that public welfare has at last attained stature in the eyes of our public as a dignified and vitally important feature of our public services. It was just about ten years ago, a little more than ten years, when former Welfare Commissioner William Hudson held me in conversation in a meeting on the top floor of the Amsterdam News building, a few blocks from here. I know that ten years is an awfully long stretch to be covered by the public's memory. But even so, I know that all of us here remember that Bill Hudson was one of the great public servants in the history of this city. And we remember that he died tragically before his time, but that he left upon the welfare operations of New York City the stamp of his imagination and his integrity and his deep humaneness. While Bill Hudson and I had been talking about the distressing indifference with which the city's welfare programs were regarded by a considerable proportion of the public. And in spite of the fact that the department was now on a regular established basis and is no longer a temporary and emergency operation. And the commissioner remarked with a grimness that was unusual in him, he was a very sunny disposition, that as long as the city of New York itself treated its public services without dignity, the people of the city could scarcely be blamed for following suit. And he went on to say this, as nearly as I can remember his exact words. He said, some of the dingy, fly-specced, foul-smelling fire traps where our offices are located are a disgrace to the city and an insult to the citizens who have to visit our offices for services. And he said, I'll never think that we're treating our staff or our clients fairly until we can set up a chain of modern, attractive buildings as welfare centers throughout New York. And then we'll be able to get the public to understand that public welfare isn't just a matter of handing out relief checks, but rather it's a job that's important because it serves the welfare of the general public itself. Now at that time, the idea that Bill Hudson expressed seemed to me to be little more than the wistful dream of a very sensitive, forward-looking city official. And especially did it seem a dream when wartime shortages wiped such building programs off the planning boards entirely and when Commissioner Hudson and Mayor LaGuardia both died before further plans could be laid. Well, it was a dream, but it was not the castles-in-the-air kind of a dream. It was a dream that had a chance to grow into reality because it represented the determination of hundreds of thousands of serious-minded New Yorkers and because it represented more than merely putting up buildings, because it represented decency in municipal administration and consideration for the needy and respect of our citizens. And that kind of a dream simply had to come true because in the long run all such dreams will come true if we believe in them hard enough and work on them long enough. And here today, though we have had two mayors since LaGuardia and four welfare commissioners since Hudson, here is the dream come true in the first of what will surely be, Mr. Mayor, a succession of similar welfare centers throughout New York City. So let's take a good look at this building now. This is probably the last time that most of us will be conscious of its beautiful facade or its architectural proportions or the layout of its office space. Because from now on, this building is going to represent not architects' plans, but people. People by the tens and possibly the hundreds of thousands. It will be literally run over with people. Because the administration and the supervision of public welfare programs, as Commissioner Carthy has indicated, constitute a tremendous operation in this city. nearly $200 million a year spent, 18 welfare centers, over 280,000 people on the public assistance rolls, help given of all sorts, food allowances, allowances for clothing and shelter, dental and medical care, care for the eyes, when these can be provided by the people themselves. But public welfare is not merely a matter of financial aid. Because financially distressed families are apt to have serious health problems. And so the department has its medical social workers available for consultation to advise relief recipients on how to meet their personal health needs. There is a resource division not merely to protect the city against fraud, but also to help the clients themselves by realizing on sources of possible income like insurance and property and the like. And families that are hard-pressed as we well know, families that are hard-pressed economically, are apt to come apart at the edges emotionally. And there are family quarrels and threatened separations, there are divorces and desertions and youth delinquency and cases of severe family neglect. And all of these inevitably become the concern of the welfare department. And its court section has been established to express that concern by working closely with the domestic relations court and the court of special sessions. and all of this, I know, sounds grimly familiar to those of us who live or work in Harlem or otherwise have special knowledge of the social characteristics and economic problems of this area. Because Harlem is a general section, whether east or west or north or south Harlem. Harlem has more than its proportionate share of social and economic problems and it therefore needs a more than average amount of help. The people of Harlem have more than their fair share of personal and group problems. And some of these problems are those of color discrimination. Others are problems of language difficulties. Some Harlemites find the going extra rough because they are newcomers to the city who haven't yet learned their way around. and others have established long residence, but they still have been made to feel rejected so often that they've lost heart and sometimes given up struggle. And these are the problems of economic deprivation. They are problems of social congestion. They are problems of psychological distortion. And Harlem needs this welfare center. But in administering, the welfare department needs the understanding support of the general public as well as the loyal and intelligent service of its center staff. And in this latter respect, and I know Hank McCarthy wants to cut my throat for doing this, for jumping the gun on him, but I can't help saying it. I think that we are awfully fortunate in the commissioner's choice of the senior administrator for the Harlem Welfare Center. I'm not going to call her name and leave it for him to do. But she's as much a part of Harlem as the corner of 135th Street and 7th Avenue because she was born on 135th Street. She graduated from Harlem and Manhattan's parochial and public schools. And with the aid of two scholarships, she completed Hunter College. She has financed two daughters of her own through college. One is a graduate of Cornell and the other has a Harvard degree. She started off as an investigator in the welfare department. She went up the ladder, interviewer, supervisor, director of special projects, administrator, and now to a top spot in this location. And so this senior administrator is to be congratulated on the opportunity for service opened up to her. But the department is to be congratulated on having appointed an administrator who knows so intimately the area in which she now serves and who's proven in so many ways her feeling of responsibility to it. Because this is no handkerchief-sized operation, not by any manner of means. 16,000 cases in this center alone involving 30,000 people. A monthly expenditure of $1,300,000 each month for this area alone. 478 staff members and two assistant administrators. 30 case units with their supervisors. Medical service, employment service, statistical unit, control unit, fire unit, stenographic pool, dictation booths, intercommunication telephones. I'll never envy any administrators their responsibility of running this operation that will so often seem to them and to others like organized insanity. But I could very easily envy them what is a rarely equal chance for service. Because what service could be greater, even if seldom appreciated, than that which lies in meeting the destitute with assistance, offering advice to the bewildered and guidance to the lost, reassuring the terrified and soothing the desperate? And what greater service to the community of New York than this one of constantly reminding our citizens that for better or worse, we are all yoked together by unbreakable bonds of common community interest and interdependence. That if one of us falls, the others must stumble. And that together we can make the city, we can yet make the city, not only the largest and the richest, but also the finest and the kindest and the most decent metropolitan center in the world. To go back to this point I've previously made, this is not merely a matter of skillful administration and staff devotion. whether at departmental headquarters or any one of our 18 welfare centers. It is a matter that involves the teamwork operation of our whole city, one that demands the most understanding and intelligent support by our general public and an unwavering policy dedicated by our city administration and followed through from year to year regardless of political changes in that administration. And the most impressive feature of this dedication to me is the fact that it represents the steady unfolding of progress in the state of welfare that has taken place regardless of changes in the mayor's office. We no longer hear the ignorant and sometimes vicious references we used to hear to public assistance as the dole. And this is because any American who is intelligent enough to read and understand what he reads knows today that the individual is so economically dependent upon our whole national economy that it's absolutely impossible for any one city, any one state and certainly for any one individual to guarantee self-sufficiency for himself out of his or its own personal resources. Public assistance, therefore, is no longer considered a charity handout. It is organized society's way of trying to make up for its own mistakes by tiding the individual and his family over a rough period for which the individual himself is apt to have no responsibility. And this growing social intelligence should also make us understand as citizens of New York that welfare funds wisely invested are not so much a tax burden as they are a social opportunity for they give us a chance to make our whole community life more decent, more humane, and more constructive. And we realize that the more we do along this line, the more it'll cost. But we realize that as community pressures become more complicated and more intense, we must do more and not less. For our children, for instance, we must give every child his birthright of protection and love, opportunity for good health and education, and a chance for the full unfolding of his personality traits. For our agent, we must give respect and similar love and protection. For our community, we must give our very best. And this is what our dedication ceremony means to me as a social worker, as a resident of Harlem, and as a citizen of New York. And that's why, Commissioner McCarthy, I'm proud to have had a part in this program. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Granger. I think this would be a good time to let all of you have a good look at the lady about whom Mr. Granger was speaking. And I am very happy to have his endorsement of our choice. We chose her for all the reasons that he mentioned, plus the fact that we know at first hand of her abilities, having seen them in operation for such a long time. So I'm very happy to present to you Mrs. Gertrude Bolden. I won't ask her to make a speech, but I would like to have her see, have you all see her. Mrs. Gertrude Bolden. It's always a great happiness for us whenever we have any kind of an occasion to be able to call, be able to call upon the sanitation ban, which, for my money and I don't mean to be invidious about any other departments, is the best ban in the city and we're now going to hear from them. Thank you. Good night. Love you. Good night. It's gradual. Good night. haha. Hey! Good night. Good night. Good day. Good night. The End The End The End The End The End The End The End However, it was finally decided to select this location and we then had to revise our plans to meet the new site conditions. It's part in bringing this structure to completion and we are very glad to assist Commissioner McCarthy in the development of his plans for future centers. Thank you. The End There are 60,000 agents receiving help from this department. 60,000 agents receiving help from this department. 130,000 people have 130,000 people have 130,000 people, and nearly 3,000 blind. And nearly 3,000 people have 216,000 people out of the total of 280,000 now receiving public assistance. That leaves about 64,000, that leaves about 64,000 others who are temporarily ill or handicapped or unemployed, which is less than one-tenth of one percent of the total population of this city. Less than 5,000, less than 5,000, less than 5,000, less than 5,000 people have been placed in jobs as rapidly as possible. Just last month, the relief rolls went down by 5,000. There are 25,000 less persons on relief now than there were just one year ago. Our people, and this is important to bear in mind, our people do not want relief except when they have to have it. They would much prefer to have jobs. And the proof is that our relief rolls have kept going down as quickly as jobs have opened up. For those who can work, the department's big objective is to help them back to self-support and self-respect as quickly as possible. For those who cannot, and that means the aged and the children and the disabled, this city will continue to provide the kind of decent care that any of us would expect if we were in the same unfortunate position. It is my sincere hope that this institution dedicated to human welfare will be a real instrument of service to the needy in this community. An instrument to transform their desperation into hope in such a way that it will result in the individual so helped moving on into gainful occupation. And that through this help, they will be able to rise to a standard of living that will help develop their self-respect, assurance, and faith in our democratic society. To the accomplishment of this end, let us all dedicate our hearts and our hands. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. America, land that I love, can divide her and guide her through the night with the light from above.

The benediction will be pronounced by the Reverend Dr. Samuel H. Sweeney, pastor of St. Mark's Methodist Church. O God, let thy blessing rest upon this project, and upon these thy servants who will administer the work here, and upon all the people who will receive benefits through these facilities. And now the Lord bless you and keep you, and make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you. The Lord lift the light of his countenance upon you and give you peace, now and forevermore.
