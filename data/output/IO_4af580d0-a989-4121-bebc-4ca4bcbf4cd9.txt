The President of the United States who labored long and hard to get out the vote. And most of all, tribute for this victory must be paid to all the American people, working men, farmers, professional men, and civil servants, businessmen, and the millions of housewives who helped swell the Democratic vote. They showed that they are politically alert and completely able to judge candidates and political parties on their record of performance. The American people have shown what they want. They have given the Democratic Party a challenge. The Democratic Party will live up to its great trust. We have the official victory statement by Democratic Senator Jay Howard McClain claiming the election for President Obama. We're going to take the microphone to the platform and see if we can speak to him. We're up now. He's standing amid the flashbulbs which are going off here. His family wants to pass. Is this Mrs. McGrath? That's right. Mrs. McGrath, how are you? Oh, fine, thank you. How do you feel today? Very happy. Your husband, of course, is the man who led as the national chairman of the Democratic Party to this victory. May I speak to the kids? Could you get them over a second? Yeah. That was Mrs. McGrath. She's being pushed and jostled here so by the photographers that she can hardly speak. Here is young David McGrath. I'd like to get you to talk. Can you say hello? Hello. Hello. The photographers are pressing in just as quickly as they can, and we had to get back for a second while they could take their pictures. Mrs. McGrath spoke to us a moment, and perhaps you'll talk again. No, we have to wait till these photographers. They are standing on the platform now. Directly behind them are the pictures of President Truman and Vice President Alvin W. Barkley, for whom Mr. McGrath has just claimed victory and made the official victory statement, which we've been waiting for in this remarkable election so far. He's shouting back and forth to the photographers, has a great wide grin on his face. Next to young David McGrath, his son, is Mrs. India Edwards, who is Executive Director of the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee. I think she'd certainly like to have some. She reaches over and gives Mr. McGrath a great big kiss. They kiss directly on the platform here. We're going to try to get to the Senator in just a moment, but of course there's quite a rush here with television, newsreels, and everything else. We have to take our time before we can get them to speak to us individually. Senator, could you come over just a second, please? Let me step out of the way. Here is the Democratic National Chairman, Senator J. Howard McGrath. Could you talk to us a second? Oh, just to say thanks a million to the great many mutual listeners who have stayed up all night and all day for this great moment. Well, thank you and thanks for mutual, Senator. And now here is Mrs. India Edwards, Executive Director of the Women's Division of the Democratic Committee. What do you have to say? I think it's the most glorious victory the women have ever won. I know they came out and elected Harry Truman President this time. And we wanted to talk to young David McGrath a moment ago, but he was so pushed out that he didn't have a chance to. What about you? Well, I think that it's very nice to be up here and I didn't want to miss any of this and I hope Harry S. Truman will win. He did win, Lord. Well, Mrs. Edwards looks over and says he did win after that victory statement. She's not forgetting her politics. They go back now. Mr. McGrath. We take an offer. To keep our nation strong and free and to establish peace in the world. Thomas E. Dewey. What time was I sent you? Just sent a few minutes ago. That's all. That was James Haggerty, Governor Dewey's press secretary, reading the telegram, which of course means that Governor Dewey has conceded the election to President Harry S. Truman. Mr. Haggerty is now on the floor. And that probably winds up affairs here at Republican headquarters in New York. It's been a long vigil throughout the night. We've been here now for some 18 hours. And finally the climax has come. Governor Dewey has conceded the election to President Harry S. Truman. Mr. Haggerty is now re-reading the telegram for the press. Photographers are really having a heyday here, taking pictures of this very dramatic moment in this 1948 election. This is Hollis Seavey speaking from Republican headquarters in New York City. We now return you to mutual election headquarters in New York. We end up with a cooperate and consultation with me. And downtown Mar!! Well, the pictures are all done now, and I think Truman will retire for a few minutes, perhaps to work on the formal statement that he will issue later. I return you now to Mutual's election headquarters in New York. Thank you, Charter Heslop in Kansas City. Ladies and gentlemen, Harry S. Truman, by the vote of the American people, has been elected to succeed himself as President of the United States. Now, here is Gabriel Heater. Hurry, hurry, hurry! It's time for the Vaudeville Theatre. Give me a short vamp there, please, Mr. Conductor. Yes, it's Thursday night, and time for WNYC's recorded presentation of the Vaudeville Theatre. So, sit back and get ready to be taken once again to those days of the three-a-day in the Keith Circuit. Yes, sit back and listen to the Vaudeville Theatre. Now, here is the Villanuel Theatre. Now, here is the Champions League uh, aid-oh uh, Poigautres Theatre, The Witch Football scandal. Now, thanks to all for the events of the Lauder ahead��의crown, Quite a huge reward,ань literacy news.

I knew you would. And don't be blue if I eat over soup. Oh, that's a habit of mine. Oh, pardon me, it's a habit of mine. But I've got to be kissed. Oh, yes, I've got to be kissed. Oh, pardon me, but your lips are divine. And they've got to be kissed. In order that we may bring you a special broadcast, Cedric Foster and the News will be delayed. We take you now to Republican headquarters in New York. We are speaking to you from the Dewey headquarters in New York City. We're speaking to you from just outside the ballroom. Governor Dewey has just entered for a news conference with newsmen. He is posing for photographers now. And in just a moment, we will bring you this press conference of the air here from the Dewey headquarters in New York. The governor looks somewhat tired. We can't blame him for that. We're a little tired ourselves, having been on an 18-hour vigil since 6 o'clock last night. As you probably all know, the governor has been spending the whole night checking very closely the returns. And it wasn't until 11.20 this morning that he finally conceded the election to President Truman. And now, in just a moment, Governor Dewey. The governor has not yet begun the press conference since literally hundreds of photographers are taking pictures of him as he stands before the table. He's turning in various directions, wearing a gray suit. I believe the same suit he wore yesterday when we last saw him at the polling place. Now, Governor Dewey. Let's see. Let's see. All right. Will you, uh, will you allow us to go ahead without any more interruption now? So long as you won't interrupt. All right. All right. All right. Let's regard the pictures as done now. Will you not interrupt them? All right. All right, boys. No interruption. All right. All right. All right. Thank you. Is there anything I can tell anybody here that they don't already know? What happened? What happened? I am just as surprised as you are, Dick, and I gather that that is shared by everybody in the room. As I read your stories before the election. And looking back over at Governor, was it an error of strategy or of tactics or what? No. I'm Governor Warren and I are both very happy. I've talked with him that we waged a clean and constructive campaign. And I have no regrets whatsoever. Was there anything about failing to get out the grassroots vote? I don't know. I haven't had a chance to study the detailed figures. Governor, what role do you think labor plays? The question is... It's impossible to know that you know more about figures. And the governor has said it's impossible. But... It's very hard to tell. Particularly when you find states like Wisconsin and Iowa going contrary to the opinions of all observers. Along that same line, Governor, what do you think of the chief operating faculty? I think that would be impossible to answer at this stage. I'd have to study it a little more and hear a lot more opinion. Read what you, ladies and gentlemen, write over the next few days. You think you need a little guidance on the subject? Governor, sir, what are you... I'm not better able to guide you than before election. Governor, what are your... I'm going to Albany at 5 o'clock this afternoon with Mrs. Dewey and my mother and the two boys. and then I imagine I'll go down to the farm pretty soon. For the weekend, at least. You don't intend any long vacation to get over the rigors of the campaign? I haven't any plans for that. Governor, how about political plans? How about political plans? I haven't. No plans for anything at this moment. Governor, the 8P has a story on the wires that you claim to resign. I'm keeping it up short. I'm not sure. Are you trying to... Pure fiction. I don't think he's... His answer was pure fiction. Gentlemen from the 8P would like to have the 8P part of your question taken out since he says he doesn't think it was the 8P. That's a private fight you have to settle between you. Do you think resentment against the 8P of Congress may have had something to do with the 8P? The question was you think resentment against the 8P of Congress has to do it. I think that also is one of the things we'd have to conclude by after careful examination of the 8P of Congress and the election. What do you think is the future of the Republican Party? Well, as I understand it, the difference of half of 1% in three or four states would have made a different result. So, uh... That leaves the question pretty wide open, I think. Governor, what do you think of the future of the Progressive Party? Not much. You said not much and I got a big laugh. What do you think of the future of the political party? of the political party? Well, I don't like to comment on anybody else's misfortune. I guess all the newspapers in the country that had polls have red faces too this morning, don't they? They didn't even have the polls. Have you received that word from President Cohen? Have you received that word from the government? I heard his reply read on the radio, but if it had come in before I left, it hadn't reached me. But I hear from the radio what he said. Governor Dewey, do you think that the American people maybe are not ready for an intellectual appeal if they still like coin? Ruth, I'll have to leave that to your own conclusion. it won't be worth it. I'll be there. Augustine, thank you. Ugh. All right, we'll be there. What's the end, Stu?
