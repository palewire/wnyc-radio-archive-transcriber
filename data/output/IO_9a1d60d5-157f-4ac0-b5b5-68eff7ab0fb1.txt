We'll bring you now to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Hello, New York. This is San Juan, Puerto Rico, where WNYC is about to bring you the ceremonies attending the dedication of three planes by the Korean veteran now in Puerto Rico Hospital, Corporal Ango Jormez, of the Fighting 65th Regiment. The occasion is the inauguration of nonstop plane service from New York to Puerto Rico. We are awaiting the arrival of the Puerto Rican from New York City, which has just come in. On that plane is the Honorable Vincent R. Impeletari, the Mayor of New York City. He will be greeted officially by Sol Descartes, the Treasurer of Puerto Rico, Lieutenant Colonel Alberto Arriaga of the United States Army, Police-Hurring-Corn de Gauthier, who is the Mayor of San Juan, and who is about to present the Mayor of New York City with the keys to the city of San Juan. Along with them will be Stanton Robinson, the Director of the Office of Tourism. The Mayor has just descended from the Puerto Rican, the plane that will be dedicated this afternoon, along with Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, the President of Eastern Airlines. He currently is talking with Felisa Rincon de Gauthier, who is, as we said, the Mayor of San Juan. They are, of course, besieged by newsreel photographers and representatives of all the major press services in this continent. You can hear in the background the press asking Mayor Impeletari to pose for them, and he is here as usual, applicable self, currently following the Latin custom of kissing the hand of the Mayorist of San Juan, Puerto Rico. In a moment or so, we're going to try and get over to the Mayor to see if we can get a few words from him, although we are deceived somewhat here by all personnel who have come out to greet this plane. Later on, we will be hearing the actual ceremonies of dedication, which will be participated in by three veterans, all of the 16th regiment, which represents the country of Puerto Rico. The main dedicatory message will be delivered directly from Washington, D.C. by Jorge Lando Gomez, who, as you may know, is the triple amputee veteran of Korea, currently at, as we say, Walter Reed Hospital. We are going to try to pick him up directly by direct line. And now, ladies and gentlemen, you are about to hear Captain Eddie Rickenbacker of Eastern Airlines introduced to you by Mr. Harwood Hall. Mr. Hall is the general manager of radio station WAPA in San Juan, Puerto Rico. What you are hearing in the background is the Spanish introduction to Captain Eddie Rickenbacker that, I believe, will be followed by Mr. Harwood Hall speaking in English. We are working to provide Puerto Rico the same air service that the Eastern Airlines offers in other parts of the continental United States. The inauguration of these flights between San Juan and New York on the domestic route of the Eastern Airlines, passing by San Juan a country, and the country's main destination. The United States is the result of the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States. The United States is the result of the efforts of the government and the people of Puerto Rico to provide the island with high service rates available in all the other states of the nation. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, President and General Manager of Eastern Airlines. And I will now be the first to meet the American Airlines Airlines. Many of you know Captain Eddie as the ace of aces in World War I. You are familiar with his record in World War II. Many of you know he is the leading figure in aviation today, heading one of the world's largest airlines. This is a great day for Captain Eddie as well as for Puerto Rico because for many years he has worked toward giving Puerto Rico the same kind of airline service offered other parts of the United States. The inauguration today of flights between San Juan and New York on Eastern's domestic grout making San Juan a key city system on the mainland is the result of his efforts and the efforts of the government and people of Puerto Rico to bring to the island the high standard of service and low passenger fares available elsewhere in the United States. Ladies and gentlemen, damas y caballeros, Captain Eddie Rickenbacker. Thank you very much. Naturally, all of us are very happy to be here. But before getting into the program, we'd like to hear from the Governor's representative, the Honorable Saul Descartes. Twenty years ago, scarcely 50,000 people traveled between Puerto Rico and continental United States. Ten years ago, that figure was slightly 60,000 people. Last year, the president of the United States was a 300,000 people traveled between the island and mainland. The development of aviation is responsible for this tremendous growth in travel. And it is this growth that is making us more and more every year become a part, in fact, of that great federation of free people, the United States of America. To inaugurate one more means through which the citizens of this great federation will be brought together more closely. It is indeed with great satisfaction that we see this new link established by Eastern Airlines, a truly great company, ably headed by a remarkable American American, Captain Eddie Rickenbacker. Captain Eddie Rickenbacker. Captain Eddie Rickenbacker. May now be in Spanish. I have a great deal with the same way. I want to know that I have to say those words in Spanish. I have 20 years ago, a lot of people have traveled between the United States and Puerto Rico. I have 20 years ago, only 50,000 people traveled between the United States and Puerto Rico. 10 years ago, that number of people have traveled between Puerto Rico and the continent. The number of people traveled between Puerto Rico and the continent, 300,000 people traveled between Puerto Rico and the continent. The development of aviation has been responsible for this big increase in the number of people who traveled between the island and the continent. And it is through this growth that every year, more and more, we are more part of that great federation of free people who call the United States of America. We are here today, of 6 months. At large time, a structure like renovating what the United States of America, and it is for us a great satisfaction that this union line constitutes the Eastern Airlines a great company directed with great success by a notable man of this century Captain Eddie Rickenbacker Thank you very much Mr. DeCartus on behalf of the distinguished guests myself who have honored both Puerto Rico and Eastern Airlines by making this historical inaugural flight from the mainland to San Juan this new service initiates a new era in the history of Puerto Rico this island and its nearly two and a half millions of American citizens are and have the right to be considered an integral part of the mainland of the United States the order of the President of the United States and the Civil Aeronautics Board authorizing the establishment of this service we are inaugurating today is high recognition of the ever increasing importance of Puerto Rico to the economy of the mainland and to the security of these United States Eastern Airlines is more than pleased to have been selected by the President of the United States and the Civil Aeronautics Board to provide this urgently needed service we consider it both a privilege and an obligation to Puerto Rico to offer Puerto Rico the kind of transport service upon which the continuing progress and prosperity of this island depends to provide that service adequate to your needs at a price the people of Puerto Rico can afford to pay our initial schedules which are faster and our initial rates which are lower is an earnest effort of our determination in this direction as a result of this new service Puerto Rico will have two main trunk line airways direct non-stop to the mainland gateways New York and Miami respectfully by Eastern Airlines through these gateways over the network of Eastern Airlines your capital of San Juan will have better faster and cheaper service from the 90 odd key cities of industry and population in the eastern half of the United States from these areas we hope to attract the Puerto Rico the industrial activity and thousands upon thousands of tourist travelers who should have and know more about and enjoy the advantages of the unrivaled opportunities of this friendly most colorful and oldest land under the American flag in the establishment of this service we have not asked our government or the taxpayers for one cent of subsidy of any kind we ask only the privilege and the opportunity to provide this urgently needed service confident in our ability to share profitably in the development of this great area just as Eastern has contributed to and shared in the tremendous progress of the South and the Gulf States and the Southwest and the Northeastern United States and in two of the three fastest growing areas of the mainland we are hopeful too that with this recognition of Puerto Rico's importance in our national pattern of domestic airways that the Civil Aeronautics Board will properly recognize these facts and reverse its recent decisions so as to provide for the establishment of a Southern Transcontinental Service with San Juan as its most Southern terminal through Florida the Gulf States and Southwest to the Pacific Coast the people of these important areas have for more than 20 years stopped such assistance from our federal government the requirements of our national emergency program now and in the interest of our national defense make such a transcontinental route of first importance to the security as well as the welfare of these important areas finally may I express appreciation for the wholehearted support we have received from the people of Puerto Rico from one end of the island to the other in our struggle for the right to establish this new air service which we are inaugurating today the leadership of your great governor and the tireless efforts of your government officials and the leaders of your industry and commerce alone made this achievement possible on behalf of Eastern Airlines and its entire organization I pledge you in return that we shall devote every effort every facility at our command that this air service shall
