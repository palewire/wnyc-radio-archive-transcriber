The End Two little girls in blue, lads, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lads, who won your father's home. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted above. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow's last is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I too. Come, come, come, come, come. Ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Comrades, when manhood was morning, they blew, oh, there might be kind. When danger's precious, my darling, old comrade was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken. And a mother's heart has broken. There is just another thing from the old home that we've all. There is still a memory living. There's a father unforgiving. There is still a memory living. And a picture that is good, who's a blue. Mario! She's my sweetheart, I'm her love.
