This afternoon, most of you participated in the very simple and significant ceremony by which this magnificent place was transferred to the University to serve as a home for this and future meetings of the American Assembly. This represents, from the standpoint of the University, the fulfillment of an aspiration for such a conference center which we have long held. We believe that the plans which have been made and which are now approaching fruition have been soundly made. We believe, and indeed I need not add that we hope, that this will prove to be an institution of national service which will thoroughly justify the effort that has been made to make it available. And which will justify, in addition, the generosity of the Harriman brothers whose assist without his assistance this could not have been done. And so, ladies and gentlemen, I have the very great pleasure, on behalf of the University Administration, now in turning this meeting and the future sessions of this meeting of the Assembly, over to Ambassador Douglas, the Chairman of the National Policy Board, in whose hands we are from now on. Ambassador Douglas. Ambassador Douglas. Ambassador Douglas. Ambassador Douglas. Ambassador Douglas. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Gracie Kirk, Vice President and Provost of Columbia University. Now Ambassador Douglas. Dr. Kirk, members of the American Assembly and its guests, in calling this Assembly, this first session of the American Assembly to order, as it were, I am not unruly, but I am not unruly, but I am not unruly, but I am not unruly. I am not unconscious of the, of the handicap under which it is being held. It is the handicap of the absence of the President of Columbia University, General Eisenhower. And he regrets deeply that his duties elsewhere prevent him from participating in this session of the Assembly. But he's expressed his own feelings much more adequately and much more pungently and much more convincingly than I could do it for him. For he's written me a letter which he has asked me to read to you. My inability to attend the opening conference of the American Assembly is more than a personal disappointment. I feel robbed of an opportunity to participate in an event which I am firmly convinced will grow to be a program of incalculable value to our country. This value will, of course, depend on the objectivity and impartiality of the proceedings, the integrity and thoroughness of the professional research work, and upon the character and qualifications of the participants. This initial conference is, and must be regarded as an experiment from which much will be learned to improve and guide us in the conduct of future meetings of the American Assembly. But the quality of those who attend this conference, their abilities and high loyalty to the nation's welfare assure its unqualified success. I hope you will give Senator Taft, at the moment, has been detained, and Senator Douglas, my sincere thanks for taking the time from their public duties to speak on this occasion. I hope, too, that you will extend to every participant the assurance of my personal appreciation for this cooperation, as well as a warm welcome from the Columbia University family to the home of the American Assembly, with cordial, personal regard, Ike Eisenhower. It is a very real infirmity, and the fact that the family has been taken to the office of the American Assembly, that he cannot be here. For this is his creature. This is the child of his mind, and his personality is necessary to the growth of this infant during its early days. I am but a very poor substitute. But I am sure that you all will join with me in expressing the hope that at the next meeting of the Assembly, General Eisenhower will be here to nourish and foster the creature of his own imagination. I am sure that you are not. There is nothing I can say about the Assembly, the American Assembly, that has not already been said. But there are two observations that I should like to make. The first is that if it is to discharge adequately and effectively the responsibilities which we all repose upon it, then it must preserve with meticulous care, its compliance with meticulous care, its compliance and responsibility. The first is that if it is to discharge adequately and effectively the responsibilities which we all repose upon it, then it must preserve with meticulous care, its complete intellectual independence. I am. There is a painting, art. All Straight Fl feathers,ياvel Service,���ed aération, move within 24 Prozent of Campions against any inclusion. I remember once, many years ago, sitting with Clermont Sal in his little fisherman's cottage in the Vendée. I asked him what he considered to be the most valuable qualities of a person to possess. And after considering the question for a few minutes, he placed his hand upon my knee and he said, My son, I have lived almost the span of a century. And so he has. And he said, I have seen kingdoms made, I have seen kingdoms destroyed. He chuckled. And he said, I have probably destroyed more government than any other living person. And as I review this scene, he said, I've come to the conclusion that there are only two things in life that really matter. The first is to love and to be loved, and the second is to be intellectually honest. To be more不了 right there. I believe, the same what I précéd I did I Alaincticamente廠 Now that quality of intellectual integrity largely upon its ability to protect that one essential characteristic. The second observation I should like to make about the first session of the American Assembly is that because it is the first meeting, it must by its nature be experimental. Experimental in the way in which the data has been assembled and distributed to the participants. Experimental in the organization of this particular meeting. Experimental in the way in which the findings, if any, shall be distributed throughout the public consciousness of the country. This is an extraordinarily difficult task that has been undertaken. And it will not be easy to find the answers that from day to day and month to month will put in their questions, that will put in their appearance. And so you must, I hope you will, view this as the first earnest and sincere endeavor to perform a national service. If you have criticisms, as I hope you will have, if you have suggestions, and I am confident that you will entertain them. We express the expectation that you will express them, so that future sessions of the Assembly can be improved by this experience. I have said that this first session was operating under a handicap. And so it is. I hope that it is. But on the other side of the coin, there is an advantage. Senator Douglas and Senator Tapp have agreed this evening to present alternative views of the issues which they are believed to be associated with and implicit in the subject which was chosen for this meeting of the Assembly. That is, the United States' relationship with Western Europe, viewed from within the context of the present worldwide international environment. And I should like to add your appreciation to the appreciation of General Eisenhower to both Senator Douglas and to Senator Tapp for taking the time from their public duties to start this session off with what may be two somewhat divergent statements of opinion and of facts. Ultimately, we hope that this Assembly will be able to define some area of agreement and that it will also be able to define an area of disagreement. Disagreements are not, in themselves, injurious to a free society. Indeed, as long as men are free, disagreements will always exist. The important thing about disagreements in a free society is they reflect an honest disagreement. And so, it would be of great significance to the country if this Assembly could do no more or to define honestly and with complete integrity an area of disagreement as to fact and as to conclusion. Now, this evening, Senator Douglas has agreed to speak. Senator Taft, similarly. And here he is. I'm sorry, Bob. We proceeded, knowing that you would come because of the time element on the limitations of time on the radio. Senator Taft has agreed very generously to speak this evening and Senator Douglas, similarly, has agreed to speak. After they have finished and concluded their presentation, they have agreed to submit themselves to questions. I shall be the arbiter of the nature of the question, of the time. But I'd like to make this quite clear. That any question which is put to either of the two distinguished Senators will be put similarly to the other. And the questions will alternate. Senator Douglas will speak first and Senator Taft will speak second. The first question will be put to Senator Taft. And the similar question, an identical question, will be put to Senator Douglas. Is it? Is it? Is it there? Before we go further, I again should like to express our gratitude collectively and individually about Senator Douglas and Senator Taft for agreeing to come here and to start this first session of the assembly off, as it were, on a high plane. Neither one of these two gentlemen need any introduction and I would be wasting your time, their time, and everybody else's time, if I were to attempt to introduce them. I merely want to make it clear that the one is entitled to as much respect as the other. This is a frightfully difficult thing to do. I could say something very nice about both of them and be quite honest. And that I shall. Senator Douglas has been a distinguished member of the Senate since he first went there in 1945. With his views, many of us have from time to time disagreed. But no one of us has ever questioned his intellectual integrity. And with the full assurances of all three unions, you are coming here tonight, our respect for you as an individual, and as a member of the second, amongst the senior branch of the legislative part of the United States government. I introduce you. My name is Mr. Douglas, and our friend and colleague, Mr. Tass, friends of the assembly. It's a very real honor to be invited to help initiate the discussion in this opening session of the American assembly. And one naturally feels quite humble and somewhat inadequate before the task. I'm afraid that most of the things that I have to say about the importance of Western Europe to the United States will seem fairly obvious. And perhaps trite to such an able audience as this. My only excuse is the saying of Dr. Johnson that men need not so much to be informed as to be reminded. And also perhaps I can lay a basis for the discussion, much more valuable discussion, which will follow in the days ahead. I want to start with the fundamental thesis that it is of vital importance to the United States that Western Europe should not fall into Russian hands. It would not seem necessary to labor this point were it not for the fact that there are still many in this country who seem to believe that the United States could ultimately go it alone and have a very good chance for survival if we did face a completely hostile world. The present division of the population of the world approximately in the ratio of one to two. Seven hundred and fifty millions under communist direction and approximately a billion and a half under non communist direction. About three quarters of the billion are in Asia, Asia Minor, the islands of the Pacific. And therefore aside from natural resources are not of great immediate military importance. If the two hundred and fifty million peoples of Western Europe were added to the seven hundred and fifty million under communist control. And the some two hundred and fifty million under communist control in Europe proper. We would have on our side the hundred and fifty three million of the United States plus the thirteen million of Canada. Plus possibly the forty million of Mexico and the Caribbean. Or a total of not greatly in excess of two hundred million people. So that from the standpoint of population we would have the odds very much against it. From the standpoint of industrial resources we would be about on an even basis. As you know the steel capacity of the United States is present one hundred million tons a year. Steel capacity of Russia is thirty five million tons a year. The steel capacity of Western Europe is sixty five million tons a year. As long as we have Western Europe on our side. We can out produce the Russians. And I suppose steel is the most sensitive index. In the ratio of approximately five to one. But if Western Europe passes into Russian hands. The steel capacity of the communist bloc will then be approximately equal to our steel capacity. The shipbuilding capacity of Europe will be in excess of certainly our present shipbuilding capacity. So the first simple thesis and it's very trite and very obvious. Is that from the standpoint of population and industrial resources. We cannot afford to let Western Europe move into Russian hands. What about the economic aspects of Europe. We of course do not depend upon Europe for any vital war materials with the exception of Mercury. It is South America. Asia and to some degree Africa. So called tropical regions of the world. Which we need for raw materials. But a third of our exports go to Western Europe. And our three great export crops. Upon which the prosperity of the South and the Middle West depends. Largely depend upon Europe as a market. A third of our cotton is exported. Most of which goes to the cotton mills of England and the continent. Roughly a third of our wheat. Most of it for Western Europe. A quarter of our tobacco. So that if Western Europe were to fall into communist hands. These markets for exports would be shut out. Cut out. And we would have great economic distress. In this country. If they are held. And if in addition we can build up a. Greater degree of economic unity. Between the United States and Western Europe. So that our alliance is not merely a military one. But it's also an economic one. Then the capacities for the expansion of our exports will be almost unlimited. The United States and Canada are the natural granaries. Or the industrial regions of Europe. The agricultural factories. Agricultural machinery factories of this country. Can produce agricultural machinery cheaply and efficiently. And could be used to build up the agriculture certainly of Germany. Possibly to some degree of Western Europe. The machine tool industry of this country. Could find a great market in Europe. The electrical machinery of this country. Could find great expansion. And perhaps if we can become strong enough allies. Wedded closely enough to each other. We can create a great economic system. Which will span the Atlantic. And make possible international division of labor. On a very wide scale. To the advantage. Of both countries and all people. But I do not wish to be purely materialistic. I do not wish to speak entirely in terms of military strength. Industrial potential. Increased military prosperity. It is certainly also true that Western Europe and the United States. Are with all our differences. A cultural unity. These sections of the world. Where we have developed political democracy. Political freedom. Great religions of Christianity. Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Are the basic faiths. And do not as a matter of fact. Greatly extend outside. Of Western Europe. And the United States. Except in the case of Catholicism. South America. And the Latin American country. So. To repeat. I do not think we can take lightly. The danger that Western Europe. Might fall under communist hands. And if that were to happen. It would be a calamity for this country. Of the first magnitude. Because at present. If we take total communist military strength. Of approximately 175 divisions. Plus. 60 divisions. In the European satellites. Exclusive of the Chinese army. We have a total of 235 divisions. Against which. The. Countries of Western Europe. Probably could not put more than 15. In the field. And then they would have to. Draw up on so-called territorial. And the French reserve division. And the French reserve division. So. First. To repeat. Finally important. That Western Europe. Should not fall under communist hands. Then the question comes. How can it be defended? Some have advanced the idea. That. It can be defended primarily. By. Our contributing air and sea power. But not any appreciable number. Of land troops. That the defense of Western Europe. On the land. Should be either. Predominantly. Or. As in some cases. As this is advanced. Exclusively. The function of Western Europe. Well. I would say. That the defense of Western Europe. On the land. Should be predominantly. The concern. Of Western Europe. But it should not be. Exclusively. The concern of Western Europe. In the first place. It seems probable. That we would not have. Air superiority. If any attack. On Western Europe. Would occur. Within the next. Two or three years. The. Russian superiority. In tactical aviation. Is so great. That it will take. An appreciable amount. Of time. Before we can build. Our. Air forces up. So that. We could launch them. Against an advancing. Russian. Or. Satellite. Advance. Through Germany. And through Western Europe. You may say. That. It is the fault. Of the administration. That it does not. Build up. The air force. Or you can say. That it is the fault. Of the air force. That it does not. Developed. Tactical aviation. And is concentrated. Instead. On strategic bombing. Or you can say. That it is. Inherent. The desire. The desire. Of the American people. Not spend. Very much. On element. And to. Try to. Economize. It matters. Of defense. Whatever the. Explanation. May be. Certainly. It is true. That. We would not have. Air superiority. In the immediate future. And that therefore. The. Prospect. That is held out. From the air. Seems to me. To be fallacious. In the second place. With. Even if we did. Control the air. At least. With. Such weapons. As have been. Developed. And put into practice. Up to the present. The. Lesson of Korea. Seems to be clear. That air power. Cannot stop. An advancing army. We have had. Dominance. In the air. Over Korea. Ever since the beginning. Of hostilities there. We controlled the air. When the North Korean. Surged down. From. Across the 38th parallel. Down through. Central. Korea. And almost. To the gates. Of Busan. And yet. Our air power. Was not able. To turn back. The. North Korean armies. We similarly. Had dominance. Over. Korea. When the Chinese. Armies. Attacked. In November. And in December. And while our air force. Did extremely well. It was not able. To stop. The Chinese land. Armies. Most of us. Have talked. Probably. With people. Who have returned. From Korea. Everyone. With whom I have talked. Has said that. That is certainly. One of the lessons. Of the Korean War. That aviation. In itself. Cannot stop. Ground troops. Now. It is quite possible. That. We may. Be able. To deliver. Atomic. Bombs. In such. Minute. Quantities. As to. Stop land armies. In the future. That is possible. That we can. Localize. The effect. Of an atomic. Explosion. Of an atomic. Explosion. So that it can be. Used. Against a division. A corps. Or an advancing army. But. I think. We shouldn't. Depend on these. Possible. Buck Rogers. Developments. If they have not. Yet. Been tried out. And have not yet. Been demonstrated. Yet. Demonstrated. It seemed to be. Unsafe. To. Place. Our reliance. Upon. Air power. In the face. Of the Korean experience. And not. And we should not. Depend. Upon weapons. Which have not yet. Been developed. Or tried out. The scientist. Always. Wants. To abolish. The infantryman. And to. Transform. A war. Into a push button. Affair. In which. Science. Is dominant. But. In every. War. That has occurred. Is the human spirit. That is ultimately. Tested. And it is the land armies. And the infantryman. Who ultimately. Make the difference. Between success. And failure. So. I would like. To advance. The thesis. That. The continent. Of Europe. Cannot be defended. By air power. Alone. Certainly not. By our air power. In its present form. And that if it is. To be. Successfully defended. There will have to be. A large army. A large. Well equipped army. Fighting to defend. That area. That area. Well. You asked. Why should not. Europe itself. Furnish. The. Exclusively. The army. Is it not. Their territory. Is it not. Their population. Which. Will be attacked. Invaded. Conquered. Should it not. Therefore. Be their. Exclusive. Responsibility. As I have said. I think it should be. Their predominant. Responsibility. But I do not believe. That it can be. Their exclusive. Responsibility. From the prudential. Reason. Alone. to fight. That. To fight. To fight. That. To fight. That. Western Europe. Will probably. Be willing. To fight. If it feels. That it has. A fair chance. Of success. Will be much greater. If American troops. Are fighting. Alongside. Of their troops. Rather than. Remaining. In the rear. Protecting. The British Isles. But not. Engaging. In any struggles. On the continent. My good friend. Senator Taft. He will forgive me. If I. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. To. Try to quote him. In advance. On this. All right. My good friend. Senator Taft. On other occasions. Has advocated. This doctrine. Of. Defending Europe. By. Air and Sea Power. That's fundamentally. As I understand it. The same policy. Which the. Which Great Britain. Adopted. In relationship. With the continent. For. At least. Two centuries. In the time. Of Queen Anne. Particularly. At the. Poleonic Wars. And at the outbreak. Of the First World War. Though wars. Were much less destructive. In those days. Than in these. It did not arouse. Very much enthusiasm. For Great Britain. On the part. Of the French people. The French people. Felt. That. Great Britain. Was pushing them. Into the forefront. Letting them. Take the Buffets. To the West. And. And. Remaining. Discreetly. A safe position. And it was this policy. Which won. For Great Britain. The title. On the continent. Of Papidius Albion. It put such a strain. Indeed. Upon the. Franco-Pritish. Relationship. That. In the preparations. For World War Two. The French. Were insisting. That there should be. British. Divisions. On the continent. Of Europe. In the very beginning. And while. I suppose. The full diplomatic. And military. Negotiations. Of the 20s. And 30s. Are not known. Certainly. The French. Constantly. Insisted. That at least. The British. Should be there. Initially. At the trouble. So. I think. It's quite apparent. Although. This may be questioned. That the French. And people. Of the low countries. Would have. Their spirit. Of resistance. Very much. Diminished. If they felt. That both. Great Britain. And the United States. Would remain. Behind the lines. If however. They have. Pledge. That Great Britain. And the United States. Will help. Bear part. Of the initial. Shock. Even though. A minor. And therefore. Give them. An assurance. Then their will. To resist. Will naturally. Be greatly heightened. That was the testimony. Of. General Eisenhower.

Ag would use the misschien, I do not see how we could expect to hold Great Britain for long if the continent of Europe were to be lost to the Russians. Russians undoubtedly have developed guided missiles far beyond the point which the Germans have developed them. They have a great many of the German scientists with them, and they could set up their launching platforms from the channel. And with the range which guided missiles now have, it seemed to me that they would virtually be able to compel a surrender by Great Britain, and Great Britain did surrender, that we would lose these air bases upon which Mr. Hoover and others seemed to depend. Therefore, that we need a peripheral of land on the continent of Europe to protect the very island bases which we need for air or for an aviation attack. I suddenly remember that I omitted perhaps the most obvious point of all in this discussion that I've been giving, namely that you cannot expect the Western Europeans to have much enthusiasm if we permit them to be conquered in the first place and then bomb them to pieces after they have been conquered as a reward for their behavior. And yet that is precisely the consequence of those who advocate air power alone. Well, if Western Europe should be defended, and if land armies as well as air and sea power are needed for its defense, the next question comes as obviously whether we are being asked to bear a disproportionate share of the burden. Nobody quite knows what the Brussels agreement provided for, but we know from the statement of former Prime Minister Plevin that under it France is committed to furnish 20 divisions. Probably Great Britain committed to furnish approximately 8 divisions. Low countries, perhaps 5 to 6 divisions. The statement of General Marshall before the Armed Services Committee was that the United States is committed to furnish 6 divisions. That makes a total of 40 divisions, excluding Italy and West Germany. It is probably not too far from the point to say that it is planned to build up a force of from 50 to 60 divisions at a minimum with the target date perhaps in 53, although I hope it will be at the end of 52. And our contribution of six divisions out of this total would therefore be from one-eighth to one-tenth of the total, we bearing in addition the equipment of a number of divisions, particularly the French divisions. I would suggest therefore that this is not a disproportionate share of the initial amount. On the contrary, it would seem to be a modest share. I had thought that probably we could go up to a ratio of one to four or one to five, which would mean that we would contribute from one-fifth to one-sixth of the total. And therefore, I had thought that under the Brussels Agreement, we would probably go up to ten divisions. That did not seem excessive to me, although I did not want us to contribute and do not want us to contribute a larger fraction than this amount, one-fourth or one-fifth to one-sixth of the total. But we have a large margin of safety to operate on, and therefore after General Marshall's pledge, a statement that present plans call for only six divisions, I cease to advocate placing a ratio in the resolution approving the sending of troops to Europe. Another question that inevitably comes up is whether the other countries are doing their share. Certainly under the Brussels Agreement, they are pledged to do their share. The question is, have they given any present evidence of doing their share? In January, I collected some figures on this point, which I believe are substantially accurate. I shall repeat them and try to bring them as much as possible up to date. In all these comparisons, we want to take the relative burden, and not merely the absolute amount of the contribution. And one of the best measures of relative burden in terms of armed forces is the number of men per 1,000 population, which are who are in the armed forces. As of the end of March, we had 18 men out of every 1,000 population who were in uniform. And interestingly enough, that was the precise ratio in Great Britain and in France as well, 18 to the 1,000, so that they were on an equality with us. In Italy, the ratio was only one-third of this, about 6 to the 1,000. But that was because the Italian peace treaty in itself placed a ceiling on the maximum size of the Italian forces. The smaller nations of Western Europe had a ratio of only 10 to the 1,000. And I think it is true that they and the British Dominions to date, and I included in this all the British Dominions, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, have been coasting along on the strength of the so-called great powers. If they are to make a proportionate contribution, they should greatly increase the number of men under arms. Belgium and Holland and Denmark, and Australia, New Zealand and Canada. It's always somewhat ungracious, however, for the big nations to urge the small nations to arm in this fashion. But there is an obligation upon them. The point I want to make is this, that as of January, they had as many men under arms in relationship to that population as we have. Indeed, if you were to take the French reserve forces, men who had served their period of compulsory military service, and had passed into the reserve, and there were a million and a half of those, and formed in reserve divisions, though poorly equipped, the French ratio was 50 to the 1,000, as compared to our 18. I was basing my figures on two and three-quarter million men under arms as of the end of January. Of course, we hope that by summer, and is planned by summer, to have roughly three and a half million men under arms. That would be 23 to the 1,000. But there is every evidence that when the French add 15 more divisions on the continent of Europe, which is their plan, that the French ratio will exceed 23 to the 1,000, and that the planned increase in the size of the British forces, which runs from 100,000 to 200,000, the total men, will bring them very close to 23 to the 1,000, perhaps 21 to the 1,000. So that I think we can say that the major powers are going up together in the ratio of men in the armed services, and that we are not being asked to bear, we are not being asked to bear a disproportionate share of the manpower burden. What about the financial support? What about the money contributions, which, though less important than men, are still extremely important? Well, I've made some comparisons there, too, taking the expenditures for national armament and figuring them as a percentage of gross national product. I would prefer to take net national income as a better absolute measure, but as a relative measure. I think it's all right to use gross national product for the various countries. Last year, the year 1950, all of these countries were probably spending, with the exception of Italy, or rather we should say UK and France, were probably spending a somewhat larger fraction of their national income for purely armament purposes than were we. At present, we are spending at the rate of 25 billion a year, which is about one-twelfth of our gross national product, or a little over eight percent of the total. The ratio for France and the French budget, 9.7 percent, and for the United Kingdom, 8.0 percent. The French budget may be slightly padded for military expenditure, but I think one can safely say that the French, as of this moment, are spending about the same proportion of their national income that we are spending, and the British are probably spending as large a fraction of their national income. We, of course, intend to double this rate of expenditure, from 25 billions a year to a rate of 50 billions a year, and that 50 billions will include the sums which we will spend for the rearmament of Western Europe, re-equipping French divisions. This will be one-sixth of the gross national product, assuming that to be a constant magnitude. The British budget is going to increase, but according to my figures, it will not increase much beyond 11 percent of the gross national product. The French may get up to 11 percent. This is the first point, this is the first figure which I've turned up, indicating a greater degree of sacrifice on our part than the major European nations. But let us see, let us go into that a bit more and see whether it really is a greater degree of sacrifice. The per capita real income of the United States, in terms of American dollars, is about fifteen hundred dollars per year. The per capita income, in terms of American dollars in Great Britain, is about seven hundred fifty dollars a year. And in France, something over four hundred and fifty dollars a year. Or in other words, our per capita income, in terms of real purchasing power, is about twice. The per capita purchasing power of Great Britain, and at least three times, possibly and probably more, the per capita real income of France. Well, in this country, we've come to accept the fact of the progressive income tax, that people with a larger real income can bear a larger percentage tax, without necessarily any greater psychic sacrifice. I submit, therefore, that in view of the fact that our real income per capita is twice that of Great Britain, three times that of France. It is not disproportionate for us to spend one-sixth of this per capita income on our month, as compared to one-ninth in Great Britain and in France. In short, the conclusion to which I come, at least, is that in view of the importance of the stake, in view of the inadequacy of air and sea power alone, in view of the contributions which Europe is already making, and to which Europe is pledged under the Brussels Agreement, that it is proper for us to send these four added divisions to Europe, and to stand beside them if a land attack occurs. Now, the terms of reference which Mr. Douglas gave me, were that we were to discuss the relationships between Europe and the United States, primarily. In fact, there was nothing else mentioned in the covering letter and covering telegram. But I know how impossible it is to confine any discussion of foreign affairs at this time, purely to Western Europe. And perhaps this is all right, although it's sometimes rather difficult to deal with, because as you try to discuss one subject, you find other parts of the globe being brought in. But since it is a global struggle, I think perhaps it's appropriate to say a few words, at least, about Asia. I want to say that this program of defending, helping to defend Western Europe, in no sense implies any abandonment of Asia. I'm not here to make a party speech or to defend the present administration. I like to think for myself, and I like to believe at least, that I take my positions independently of the line of my party. But I think it is appropriate to point out that the administration, which with the aid of many splendid Republicans, has come to the defense of Western Europe, is also the same administration, which came to the defense of Korea. And I know that act was questioned at the time, both on its constitutionality and afterwards on its wisdom. And I think it is important to have been, and it seems to have been a fundamentally wise procedure, because if we had not done so, inevitably all of Asia would have fallen, and the feeling of discouragement and of defeat would have leaked over into Europe, and it might well have been the spark precipitating and advance in Europe. We have achieved great things in Korea at real cost, to be sure. We have destroyed the North Korean army. We are rapidly chewing up the Chinese Communist army. We have saved Indochina, at least for the present, from attack and preserved the Malay Peninsula. We are splitting the Chinese people away from the Chinese Communist government and from their Russian masters. And we are vindicating the principle of collective security. The mistakes made in the military conduct of the war. I wish that the other members of the United Nations had stood beside us and stood beside the United Nations somewhat more loyally, both in their contributions of troops and in their willingness to apply economic sanctions to the aggressors. But on the whole, the job is being done. I do not wish to launch a discussion as to the precise steps to be taken in Asia. I think that's outside the terms of reference which Mr. Douglas gave us. But I do wish to say most strongly that it does not in any sense mean that the adoption of a strong policy in Europe does not in any sense mean the abandonment of Asia. On the contrary, the two are faces of the same policy, which is to resist aggression wherever it occurs, provided only the two conditions are meant. In the first place, that the place is accessible. We have not taken up the cause of Tibet. Tibet's too inaccessible place to reach. And provided in the second place that other nations make a substantial and an equitable contribution to the common defense. I think that's the American policy.
