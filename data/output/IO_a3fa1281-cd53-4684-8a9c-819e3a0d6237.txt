Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir, say au revoir, say au revoir. But not goodbye, but not goodbye. The past is dead, but not goodbye. Love cannot die, not goodbye. Better far had we not met. I love you then. I love you, yes. Maybe, maybe, give me your answer too. I love crazy, for the love of you. It won't be a smiling marriage, I can't afford a family. But you don't speak, but not speak, I think so good for you. When you hear the rest of kings in me, For joy, love, and crazy you must sing. And when the birds stand through, In the forest of the night, there'll be a hot night, To your ground tonight. When you hear the rest of kings in me, For joy, love, and crazy you must sing.
