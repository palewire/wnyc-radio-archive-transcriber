All right, let's take it. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, we are speaking to you now from historic City Hall in New York City, where Thomas F. Murphy, whose present term is Police Commissioner, expires today, and he is about to be sworn in by Mayor Vincenna and Pelletere for a full five-year term in the post of Police Commissioner here in City Hall. The Mayor has commended Mr. Murphy for having discharged his responsibilities to the Mayor's complete satisfaction, and the Mayor went on to declare that he, meaning Mr. Murphy, could remain in his police post as long as he desires. The expiring term was originated by Arthur W. Wallander, who is, of course, at present Director of the City's Civil Defense Organization. William P. O'Brien, you will recall, succeeded Mr. Wallander in 1949, and then he was succeeded by Police Commissioner Thomas F. Murphy. In just a moment now, you will hear the Mayor swearing in Police Commissioner Murphy. I hold the pictures until I get through the swearing. I, Thomas F. Murphy, do solemnly swear that I will do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New York and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the Office of Police Commissioner of the City of New York according to the best of my ability. Congratulations Tom. to the best of my ability. According to the best of my ability. Congratulations, Tom. Thank you very much. Congratulations to you. Ladies and gentlemen, you've just heard the Honorable Vincent R. M. Pelletary, Mayor of New York City, swear in, please, Commissioner Thomas F. Murphy for a term of five years in his present post. These ceremonies have originated in historic City Hall, and we return you now to our studios in the Municipal Building, where we will join with WNYC-FM for the program already in progress.
