A spiritual is just sung by the choristers. And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabelle de Bore, accompanist, in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks is plenty of plenty, found a lot on the door. Pray somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? I've got no luck on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the drugs from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the sky, are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my song, and the head is a-whole-day-long. Do you complainin'? I've got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I can't go sun, can't go moon, can't the people see. I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got plenty of nothing, and worry I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of life. Never want me long, and I'm well. Never want to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell, are you glad I'm the boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, got my gals, for heaven no day long. What are you complaining? Drop my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Bet.
