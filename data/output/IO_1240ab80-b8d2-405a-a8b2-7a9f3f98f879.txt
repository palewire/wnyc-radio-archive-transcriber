Thank you, gentlemen. This afternoon, we are privileged to have a Prince of the Church with us at the dedication of a cathedral of healing. And with the psalmists we say, except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. It has been said that in no activity does man approach nearer to God than when he ministers to his fellow man. It is in that spirit that the James Ewing Hospital is being dedicated today. And it is in that spirit of dedication that I am privileged to call upon his eminence Francis Cardinal Spellman to pronounce the invocation. Cardinal Spellman. Cardinal Spellman. New haven for the helpless. Gain to seal the James Ewing Hospital as a home where thy glory dwellest, thou who gloriest in mercy deeds. Curing the afflicted and destroying dread diseases. Keep thy merciful presence abiding within its walls. Quickening with divine and human hope and health those that enter here for care and cure. Bless those that labor here in this hospital. With thee and for thee in thy workshop of mercy. For thine is the light finding dark causes. Thine is the light finding dark causes. Thine is the light finding dark causes. Thine is the light supporting great labors. Thine is the light renewing doomed bodies. Thine is the hope girding worn spirits.

welfare And for man's eternal salvation Amen We are met here this afternoon To dedicate the James Ewing Hospital Devoted to the treatment of and research in neoplastic diseases This meeting is a real historic occasion for our city How urgently this hospital is needed Is evident from the fact That as our population increases in age The incidence of cancer also rises Nor is cancer limited to those in the afternoon of life It strikes the helpless infant The adolescent child And men and women in their most promising and productive periods It casts its malignant shadow upon every home In New York City alone The disease has increased From a mortality rate of 136 per 100,000 During the decade between 1930 and 39 To 185.8 Approximately 186 per 100,000 in 1949 Presenting a challenge Which calls for the massing of all the knowledge The skills and techniques that science is possessed of Plus all the humaneness And the love of mankind That can be encompassed Within the spirit of civilized humanity And it is this great harmony of skills and attitudes That we shall find here At the James Ewing Hospital This hospital which we are dedicating today And the Francis Delafield Hospital Which will be dedicated later this month Are partial answers to the challenge Of the second greatest cause of death In the city of New York Moreover They are an earnest indication Of the cooperation that exists in our city Between the municipal and the voluntary hospital system And with all the medical colleges And they are the answer To those who preach that there can never be A real report between government and voluntary effort Here we have a formula In the best democratic traditions Government and voluntary effort United by mutual trust In an all-out offensive Against the greatest of all of man's enemies Sympathy for the sick And an understanding of their problems Are a measure of the greatness of a man He to whom the woes of his fellow man appeal And more than that He who understands their problem Is by these standards a great man But even a greater man is he Whose sympathy and understanding Go beyond emotions And resolve themselves into practical effort For the alleviation of these woes And the resolution of these problems By these standards No man is greater in our city Than its chief executive The Honorable William O'Dwyer I come now to what is to me And I am sure to all A sad note in these ceremonies To say farewell to our mayor The city's thousands of sick Will miss his kind understanding His zeal To better their lot The city will lose a great administrator It was under Mayor O'Dwyer's administration And under his guidance That our great hospital construction And reconstruction program Was gotten underway This beautiful new edifice The second cancer hospital That we will dedicate up At the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center Next week The 570-bed tuberculosis And chronic disease hospital On the grounds of Kings County Hospital Which we intend to open The latter part of this year The 2,000-bed Bordeskola Memorial Hospital On Welfare Island Which will be opened early next year Forever will be monuments To a great chief executive Beyond that The 150 million dollar hospital construction And reconstruction program The greatest in the history of our city Would not have been possible Without the very real help Of our principal speaker The Honorable William O'Dwyer Mayor of our city Dr. Kogel Your Eminence Dr. Rhodes Distinguished ladies and gentlemen Present at the opening of this hospital I'm grateful to Dr. Kogel For putting me on first I have a few things that Are absolutely screaming from City Hall And I must leave at once To come here today And see this cancer hospital Actually swinging into action Against one of the greatest enemies To public health Is gratifying And this is a good time For me to make a point A hospital program Doesn't develop overnight Ladies and gentlemen The first thing I did In 1946 In breaking ground Was breaking ground For this hospital It has taken all of these years To make it into a going concern I express now the gratitude Of the city To the memorial center For making the ground Upon which this hospital Rests a gift to the city I also gratefully acknowledge All the help That all the volunteer hospitals Have done for the city And are doing You have no conception Of the difficulty of meeting The demand for medical care For the indigent poor Even though I tell you That we raised the budget For our city hospitals From 37 million dollars In 1946 To 81 million dollars This year Believe me when I tell you That that only touches lightly The problem of handling the needs Of our needy citizens The volunteer hospitals A great, great Series of institutions The ones that His eminence the cardinal gives The All the other Hospitals of a volunteer nature That take our cases We have raised The contribution that we make To them for city cases But it falls far, far short Of what it cost them To give this service Ladies and gentlemen Now that this one is open We are adding a few beds Approximately 300 To hospital care of cancer Delafields next week Will be for the same purpose As Dr. Kogel told you The program of improving our hospitals Has been big The need has been great The 570 beds for tuberculosis Over in Brooklyn Will be ready in October And as he mentioned The Bird S. Kohler 2,000 beds over on the island Which you can see Will be ready by next spring For chronic disease Then and only then Will you have arrived At a point in our public hospitals Where you can take The chronic disease patients Out of your wards Where at the present time They're in Inconvenencing And making difficult The administration Of our municipal hospital Plant for acute medical cases Then you can Begin to see the improvement The $150 million program For rehabilitation And new construction Will follow It will make a total Of $192 million In six years That we have allocated For this work I wouldn't want The responsibility Of stating how $150 million Should be spent Dr. Kohler Would not want That responsibility It's too much Dr. Berniker Who proceeded Dr. Kohler Wouldn't want it So what we did Was to set up In the law A Committee A board Of civilian people Because of their interest If there were not Medical people In hospital administration Made up of that type Of people We appointed a board Staggering out their terms So that you'll always have A continuing hospital board To deal with Our municipal hospitals Not only for the construction program But to elevate And maintain The high standards That this board Has been Trying to get In their individual capacities Over a number of years Under the whole Medical profession Once This board Has been set up This is The only guarantee That Dr. Kohler And myself Can give to the people Of this city That the program Will be carried out Without let our faith In the solely Dedicated to the interests Of the needy state Of the city With that My gratitude Again To Memorial Center To Dr. Rohn To all Had anything to do With making it possible To add to the facilities Of the city For cancer patients With cancer research May the Good God Who made it possible Who made it possible Continue his blessings On it And everyone Connected with it So that when it brings Its message Of hope To the soul Who is without hope So that it gives A laugh To a human being Who has forgotten In his dread How to laugh That Is the work That God Surely Will bless Thank you very much There must be Something magnificent In the ideals Of this center Which can command The services And the means Of such outstanding Men of our country As Mr. Reginald G. Coombe Chairman of the Board of Managers Of the Memorial Center For Cancer And Allied Diseases And his associates And the thousands Of others Whom they In turn Inspire to serve And there must be Something Also In the inherent Makeup Of these men And women Which prompts them To give of themselves So unstintingly And truly This magnificence Exists in both For the center Which is composed To God And to fellow man It is now my pleasure To ask Mr. Coombe To speak to us Chairman Chairman Chairman Chairman All you ladies And gentlemen Who have come here Today Because of your Deep interest In the problem Of cancer As a public health Problem We are gathered Here today to dedicate for use the finest hospital which the ingenuity of man could devise and construct in aid of those who suffer from cancer. It is the property of the city of New York, conceived by the city for the benefit of its citizens in consultation with a professional group which has been devoted to the study of cancer as a specialty for the past 66 years. The building stands upon land deeded to the city for the purpose by Memorial Center so that the Ewing Hospital may lie adjacent to and contiguous with the three other units comprising Memorial Center, the Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Hospital Proper, and the Strength Prevention Clinic. Including those at the Ewing, Memorial Center will now have under its care nearly 600 bed cases of cancer and in its clinics many thousands of ambulatory cases coming regularly for treatment. In welcoming the city through the Ewing as our partner in the work to which we at Memorial are dedicated, I should like to tell you briefly of the philosophy, policies, and problems of the center in which the Ewing now takes its place as a vital unit. Our primary task is the study of cancer in man. Hence, the very heart and core of our center lies in the human cases to which we give the most effective therapy possible within the limits of human knowledge. We believe human knowledge must be fluid, not static, and that therefore the techniques of therapy resulting from it should also be fluid, becoming constantly obsolete as increased knowledge introduces improved methods. It is our conviction that a staff of experienced and intelligent men and women observing and treating the greatest number and variety of human cancer patients ever assembled at one point cannot fail to expose some of the present secrets of the disease and in so doing bring about a vast amelioration of it. With this objective, we have assembled two general classifications of staff personnel, the research workers of the laboratories and the clinical personnel charged with care and treatment. It is not wise, however, that these two groups should work in isolation one from the other. They must be in constant contact so that the ideas and philosophies of one may flow into and be interchanged with the ideas and philosophies of the other. Then and only then will the research staff become constantly aware of the need for the development of agents of practical use in treatment and in turn the ideas of the clinician and the knowledge of the patient and the patient and the patient and the patient and the patient. The research staff must not become vested in the infallibility of techniques of treatment accepted at standard at any given time. An investigative attitude of mind must prevail. We cannot isolate ourselves and our work from others for it must be made available wherever cancer is to be treated. Hence, in addition to the functions of research and of care, it is our obligation also to teach all we know in both of these areas. Thus, the research worker and the clinician must have a little of each of the other in him. Thus, the research worker and the clinician must have a little of each of the other in him. And both must have the ability to pass his techniques and findings on to others so that they may go out and apply them at points elsewhere beyond our walls. So that the function of teaching may be carried on under the aegis of a top university, there has just been established at the Sloan Kettering Institute, a graduate division of Cornell University Medical College. In addition to the research, greatly strengthening our educational possibilities, this will also bring about a closer collaboration with one of the outstanding general hospitals of the country, just across the street, the New York Hospital. In a sense, therefore, two great medical centers, one in general medicine and one specializing in cancer, have pooled their knowledge and their efforts for the benefit of patients at the Ewing Hospital. These splendid buildings, equipped with the most modern of apparatus and facilities which you see about you, have come into existence at great cost. Four parties have joined their resources to this end. They are you, the general public, Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Mr. Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., and now the great city of New York. To operate Memorial Center costs over $5 million annually. And that does not include the cost of operation of the new Ewing Hospital, which will be met by the city. Since neither Memorial Hospital nor the Sloan Kettering Institute nor the Strang Clinic are heavily endowed, approximately $1,600,000 for resaved and $200,000 for the hospital, or a total of $1,800,000, must be raised annually, from outside sources. The United States Public Health Service, the American Cancer Society, the New York City Committee, the Damon Runyon Fund, the Atomic Energy Committee, the National Cancer Institute, and other professional donors provide a substantial part of this. The rest must come from you, the general public. Now, I mention this because I think you should realize, counter to the general opinion that prevails, that Memorial is not a wealthy institution. Yet, I know that the public, believing our way to be for its benefit, and of high standards, will continue its support. Now, particularly to summarize, the city of the раб, we're being a spokesman program also. которые полетаeism достаточно best libraries, because of the federal and state mandates realizar," lab pourquoi?"

These is the technology closed budget or so we used to make sure that we are able to lose the system. the very finest possible medical care. It was only relatively a short time ago that Mayor O'Dwyer and his administration were faced with the problem of providing long overdue hospital facilities for this city. We not only needed new hospitals, but our existing hospitals, most of them more than 50 years old, are badly in need of modernization and repairs. The war and a subsequent shortage of materials and labor, high construction costs, the city's limited financial, limited finances, and the fact that the overlong deferred public improvements also were needed to meet the city's school, housing, health, and other requirements didn't make the job any easier. To his everlasting credit, Mayor Dreyer faced the problem squarely and promptly. Soon after assuming office, he set in motion this $42 million hospital construction program that could be undertaken immediately. It soon became apparent that the tremendous program and the construction needs of the city would require much more more than the solely pressed capital budget and debt limit could sustain. Mayor Dreyer sponsored the legislation by which you people last year were able to approve a $150 million bond issue outside the city debt limit to be used solely for hospital construction. As commissioner of the department of public works, which is charged with the design and construction of hospitals, I am proud to report to you people that the entire program is well underway. Our latest report for the first six months of this year shows that four structures already have been completed at a construction cost of $17.5 million and that we have under construction at this time five hospitals to cost an additional $53 million. to give us a construction program thus far this year of over $70 million. We also have underway a hospital design program calling for $127 million of hospital construction. Another $10 million will be used over a five-year period for the modernization and rehabilitation of some of our existing hospitals. The mayor and his administration may be well proud of this program. The mayor may be well proud of it as a personal achievement. Since his announcement that he would accept another post in the service of his country, many have been eloquent in their tribute to his record. At this time, I should like to add my own tribute and sincere thanks to the mayor for his cooperation and guidance. For his cooperation and guidance which have enabled my department during his administration to break every production record in the history of the department. For no words at my command can match the lasting tribute contained in the building that we dedicate here today. For no words at my recommendation, the mayor to the mayor to the mayor to the mayor to his hometown, he will see public improvements such as this hospital as a living testimonial and a more eloquent tribute than I could voice to him today. I should like also to point out at this time that none of this hospital program would have been possible without the forward thinking and planning of our most able hospital commissioner, Dr. Colbert, and his predecessor, Dr. Bernicke, and his entire medical staff. Also to the members of the Board of Estonia, who may well share the triumph at this moment as evidence that they have served their city well. Now let me tell you a little about this structure. It is impressive appearance is in complete harmony with the other buildings in this medical group covering the entire square block. Structurally, its hidden strength and quality equals its outer appearance. The entire building is founded on rock, and the frame is of structural steel with floor slabs of reinforced concrete. Its exterior walls of brick rise above a granite base and a slate facing to the second floor. The 12-story building with two basements has a gross volume of 2.5 million cubic feet, equal to nearly 5,000 single-family houses, and its cost is $5,600,000. The site, as you have been told, was provided by the Memorial Hospital. It occupies the entire west end of the block of the Sloan-Kittering Institute. This 275-bed cancer hospital was designed by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owens & Merrill, under the direction of my department. In direct charge of the work was the director of the Bureau of Buildings, Pointe J. Fowler, assisted by Albert Fowler, architect for hospitals on design, and William Barry, chief of the building. The plans were started way back in February of 1946, and were completed in 10 months. Excavation was started in January 1947, and today you see the completed structure, which embraces the latest developments for the medical and physical well-being of patients. It is important, it will double the present cancer facilities of the Department of Hospitality. As a practicing engineer and architect, I want to thank all the employees of my department, whose skill and toil went into the making of this public improvement. They may well share the pride, the plaudits, and the gratitude that accompany the completion of any large construction job well done. And now, Dr. Kogel, it is my privilege, as a commissioner of the Department of Public Works, to officially turn over to you this fully completed hospital, ready for service. Thank you very much, Commissioner Mullen. I'm very happy to accept this magnificent structure. Dr. Kogel, the influence of a great teacher upon his disciples is a chain reaction of goodness. Not alone are they affected by it, but they in turn radiate the knowledge and skills which they have acquired to their own disciples. Dr. Lesperance was closely associated with Dr. Ewing for many years as an associate and as a student. It is a pleasure for me to call upon her to tell us something about Dr. Ewing, the great teacher, but greater still the kindly human being who was so intensely and personally interested in the welfare of all of his patients. I, it is my great privilege to introduce Dr. Lesperance, the director of the Kate DePew-Strang Cancer Prevention Clinic. Dr. Lesperance. Specialurer Reynolds Award I'm Dr. Ewing Members and Friends. The completion of this magnificent institution is fitting tribute to the memory of a great man in the field of cancer. It does not fully indicate the far-reaching effect the dynamic personality of this simple, dignified man had on medical men and women who were fortunate enough to come under his influence. His untiring energy and enthusiasm, his desire for perfection, his vision of the great future in the study of Panther made him one of the most inspiring figures in medicine during the past 50 years. Every great man is entitled to have his shadow, and I enjoyed that rare privilege of this close association from 1910 until his death in 1943 with one of the most brilliant yet human individuals I have ever known, Dr. James Ewig. Those were the years of his greatest activity as professor of pathology at Cornell University Medical College, writing his masterpiece, Neoplasic Diseases, planning the future of a great cancer center, which would develop through expansion of the activities of the small hospital on 160. Anyone who attended the conferences there during this time felt the vast power and vision which Ewing brought to the cancer problem. His energy and capacity for concentrated mental work were boundless. He felt that a task once undertaken must, if humanly possible, be finished. He wrote me one summer, I spend my mornings at memorials where cancer runs its uninterrupted course in large numbers. At night, I take approval meals and read or write on my book till nearly midnight. I admit it grows tired, but I am going to keep it up until this book is finished or finishes me. I am going to keep it up until next. Few who read this standard work on neoplastic disease realize that every detail of this book was done by Ewing himself. His aim was to gather together in one volume a short, but complete study of neoplastic disease. Holidays and Sundays were spent at the same driving pace. It is small wonder that this continuous tempo should have culminated in severe characterisms of facial neuralgia. He often said, This is the price I have paid for my book. His loyalty to his friends was remarkable. For once you were a friend of Ewing's. He accepted that friendship as an obligation to minimize your failings and emphasize your good qualities. He was prodigal of his time to those who came for information or help in any or all problems. I have seen him spend an entire afternoon with a troubled student or an anxious patient. There was very little in Ewing of the austerity considered requisite in the public picture of a scientist. For he thoroughly enjoyed in frequent relaxation such as swimming, tennis, motoring, or a stimulating game of bridge. In all of these pastimes, he excelled. Today, we see one of his dreams realized. The establishment of a hospital for the prevention and treatment of cancer. A complete research institute. And now a hospital for chronic cancer cases. It is unfortunate that he could not see this dream come true. But we who were closely associated with him know that his was the vision. And his was the faith that laid the foundation of this world-famous cancer center. This beautiful building is a tribute to his greatness as a scientist and a physician. But the tribute that can never be destroyed is carried in the heart of those who knew him as a man of vision, integrity, and courage. Whose kindness and loyalty were priceless possessions to those who were privileged to know him as a friend. Thank you.
