The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the bugle I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, babe Goodbye, darling, I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am near the end The wind tell them I am near the end I'm near at the front to fight the foe. He was soldier boy on marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, it won't be long. We're on our way, it's pit for rain. We're going down south, through rain. We're on our way, it's pit for rain. We're on our way, it's pit for rain. We're on our way, it's pit for rain. That is why I long for you Lonely through the night I thunder Wondering, darling, is your truth Distance only lands and shams them Though the ocean waves divine Absence makes the heart profound Longing to be near you Be near your side She was happy till she met you And the fault is all your own If she wishes to forget you You will please leave her alone She has come to her old mother Just because there is no other She'll be happy in her own sweet home When the harvest days are over Yes, she is here Christ, she is here And the sun gets flowers No need rise so clear Need rise so clear You will see the word you said That's the time we do Good, she is here When the harvest days are over Just, she is here Just, she is here And the harvest days are over And the harvest days are over resources such For your little Few shall take What Reply Come of a consciousness I love a bird Third place, two birds Have you gave their life The band he adored as the band they were. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded. The poor girl was straight with her. He narrates the girl with a small-earing friend as the band they were. The band he adored as the band he was. In all my dreams, your fair-faced be. You're the flower of my heart. Sweet love, my heart. Sweet love, my heart. Sweet love, my heart. He's only a man in a fearless pain. A beautiful sight to fear. You may think he's happy and free from care. He's not the most he seems to be. He's done when you think of a wasted life. For you shall not make me wait. And her beauty was sold For an old man's gold. She's a bird in a given day.

They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad, who won your father's home. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted apart.
