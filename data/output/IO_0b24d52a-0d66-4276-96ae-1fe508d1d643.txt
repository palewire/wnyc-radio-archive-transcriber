Reverend Clergy, ladies and gentlemen, I am... consider that I am singularly honored in being chosen to represent the Police Commissioner at these ceremonies this morning, where you, uh... assemble here to perpetuate the memory of those members of the Department who have answered the final roll call. It is particularly fitting that we should assemble each year on the Saturday before Memorial Day, when all veteran organizations of the Department combine, to pay tribute to our dead whose names are engraved on the tablets that adorn the walls of this rotunda. The men whose names are inscribed on these tablets were courageous, loyal, self-respecting, devoted, home-loving, and God-fearing men. These are the attributes of a good police officer. The hundreds of names on these tablets is brilliant testimony to the never-failing courage and devotion exemplified by all of those men who gave their lives for the protection of life and property in the enforcement of law and order. A policeman's job is not an easy one. He knows not when on his tour of duty, at any hour of the day or night, he may be called upon to shoot it out with an armed thud, or to enter a burning building to rescue those who may be trapped by the flames, or to dive into the surrounding waters to save someone from drowning. In any circumstance, he is always prepared to do his duty, regardless of the odds confronting him. There has never been an instance in the recorded history of the Department where a member failed to risk his life to protect the lives of others. A recent example of this self-sacrifice was the case of Patrolman Harold K. Randolph, who, while off duty on May 12, 1951, was called to protect some citizens whose lives were threatened by a man armed with a loaded gun. Patrolman Randolph unhesitatingly approached the gunman to disarm him, but the gunman fired and fatally wounded the patrolman. In this instance, Patrolman Randolph exemplified in the highest degree the truest traditions of the Department. His name will be inscribed on the honor roll in this rotunda, in the company of the other heroes who have gone before. May we be always blessed by having men of courage and determination in all ranks of the Department. In behalf of the Police Commissioner and the members of the Police Department, I extend to the families and friends of the departed heroes our deepest sympathy, and I pray that God will give them the strength to enable them to bear the burden of sorrow with which they are led. We will now have a selection by the honor legion boys band of Thundra. That's the favor.

Thank you. encouraged from the knowledge that your loved one made a noble contribution to his fellow man that even time cannot erase. Over the years our police department has been referred to as New York City's finest. As the executive officer of the city government I have been and am earnestly proud of that description for there is no doubt that we have indeed the finest police department in the nation and in the world. I say this because it is my sincere conviction that the police force under the able guidance of Commissioner Murphy is doing an outstanding job in a most difficult period and is continuing that job in the face of some of the most complex problems that have ever faced a large municipality. I think it is appropriate to this occasion to call upon the people of the city of New York to consider the role of the average policeman in the light of all the responsibilities of his job. It is not an easy one and his work at one time or another. In fact on many occasions touches upon the lives of all of us. There is one element of that job that I brought into vivid focus today. One intangible factor that cannot be merely taken for granted and that is that regardless of daily routine or assignment every policeman walks the paths of danger. His life is constantly in jeopardy by virtue of the very nature of his service to the community. Those whom we honor today give tragic testimony to this fact. We don't know what tomorrow will bring but we do know that we can best serve their memory through a realization that the policeman's job is not commonplace and that he is entitled to the respect and cooperation of all of us in the performance of his sworn duty. On behalf of the people of the city of New York I want to thank Mr. Dave Soller and the officers and members of the Police Honor Legion for their thoughtfulness in conducting these very appropriate and impressive ceremonies here today. Thank you. We will now have a selection by the Police Department Glee Club, Still Still With Thee.

The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God the Father, and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen. The services of the Honor Legion of the Police Department are at an end. Ladies and gentlemen, from police headquarters in lower Manhattan, we have brought you the decoration of tablets and memorial services of the Honor Legion of the Police Department of the City of New York. The featured speaker this morning was his honor, Mayor Vincidar Impewateri, and representing the police commissioner of the City of New York, Thomas F. Murphy, was the fifth deputy police commissioner, General Martin H. Meany. This was the 39th annual declaration of tablets, perpetuating the memory of policemen who were killed in the line of duty during the past year. Heard on the program also were members of the Police Department Glee Club and the Honor Legion Boys Band, which you now hear in the background, composed of the sons and relatives of those who are members of the New York City Police Department. So from the rotunda of the police headquarters in lower Manhattan, we return you to our studios in the Municipal Building. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
