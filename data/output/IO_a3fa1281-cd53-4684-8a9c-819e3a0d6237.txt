Johnny, get the gun. Good, my darling, I must leave you, oh, it brings my heart to soul. Don't think that the iron need is, but the front to fight the war. Lay the white in your heart, and I can't no longer play. And I can't no longer play, oh, it brings my heart to soul. After the fall is over, after the praise of God, after the dancers are leaving, under the stars are gone, still your heart is waiting, if you'd greet them all. Come on, come on, come on. Come to me, sweet Marie. Sweet Marie. Not because your face is fair, love to see, but your soul, so pure and sweet, makes my happiness complete, makes me fodder at your feet, sweet Marie. Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that style? Isn't it a knobby one and just a proper style? I'd just like to have one, just the same as that. Where'er I go, they shout, hello! Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir, but not goodbye. The past is dead. Love cannot die. Love cannot die. We're better fall had we not met. I love you then. I love you then. Baby, baby, give me your answer too. I love crazy, oh, for the love of you. It won't be a smiling marriage, I can't afford a marriage. But you don't speak, oh, for the love of you. I think so good for you. When you hear the rest of the things in me, for joy, love, and crazy you must sing. And when the birds stand through, in the forest of the night is there a hot night, with your heart and mind. I love you then. When you hear the rest of the things in me, for joy, love, and crazy you must sing. And when the birds stand through, in the forest of the night is there a hot night, you'll come to die. We have a fight, for the night, for the night.
