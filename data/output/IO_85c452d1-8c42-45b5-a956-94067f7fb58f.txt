Be exercised on the matriculation books of black bears. black bears black bears black bears and the high wages that you tied in with that the percentage of increase I'm going to take some credit for that because we maneuvered that into your pay envelope now I say you can reduce prices you can sell more goods and I think that's the way to do it because what about the actual course of events and I can give you two sets of figures on the advance in retail prices and the advance in wholesale prices which are tremendous and they'll show this that all items in retail prices are up 17% clothing up 17.5% food up 20% and then in wholesale prices you have a farm product up 27% all commodities up 31% and foods up 43% now those increases don't represent any reasonable advance how about manufacturing prices you're concerned because industry has made profit I'm frankly for profit no no no I'm for ample profit I think it's a good thing and to pick this out now is going to be one of the causes of the next depression I've heard more reasons for the last depression I know one guy blamed it on his wife he should now I don't think you'll be able to pick this out and when this comes if it does come and I'm I'm against advertising it I heard a few speakers at this conference that I'm not going to mention them by name but I think they're creep hangers because if we don't get a depression it will not be because it wasn't the best advertised depression that ever came I don't think there's any need for how about underconsumption as a prime cause of your depression well that leads us really to another question let's get on to that for a moment do you think that wages today are sufficiently high or not sufficiently high why don't you pick that one up Mr. Zola what's your opinion about wages I think wages and I'm going to concede that there may be some spots but generally speaking wages should level off this should be the last round up if we're going to do anything from here on in let's cut the price of our goods how about organizing school teachers with the organized labor that's okay listen there's a teachers union there's a teachers let them join it that's another department I mean the teachers I think they're all right I'm for them but I have no authority to raise their wages Mr. Zola is your point that the wage line should now be held and wage permit prices to go down definitely all right what do you think about the problem now just one moment let's see what happens every time we get an increase because after all the trade union is a limited organization it's designed to take care of wages we have no influence over prices when Walter Ruther about I think was two years ago tried to discuss prices with General Motors incidentally after they raised the subject they told him to mind his own business so let's see what happened after labor was told to mind its own business on February 2nd 1946 Business Week indicated that the wage increases which the unions were receiving at that time had shaken themselves down into a pattern of 15 to 16 percent the editors of Business Week and I don't know of a Marxist among them came to the conclusion that that wouldn't represent much of a threat because it should result and they accounted for the whole line in no more than a 3 to 4 percent increase in prices very plaintively over a year later they said that isn't what was supposed to happen when they looked at the figures with retaining competition now you explain it now obviously we're going to be told to hold the line if every time we get an increase that should warrant about a 1 percent increase in prices it's used as an excuse to jack up prices at 20 and 30 percent sure we've got to hold the line we have no alternative or perhaps what we ought to do is organize as consumers but that isn't what we're discussing there's nothing wrong with the wage picture here the trouble is that the wages have been used as an excuse together with clever propagandists in order to account for increases that are completely unrelated to the wage picture and this is the proof of it why is it a proof? how did they know? when they said that a 15 percent increase of wages only meant about a 1 percent increase in prices I take it that they're very competent economists sat down with the financial statement I think the events proved that they were not I'm sure that the draw hill is going to be terribly embarrassed when they hear it from you Mr. President well I'm sorry to embarrass them but I think the events have proved that the costs have gone up much more than that proportion in fact very nearly in the same proportion as the wages went up in that case how do you account for the tremendous increase in the operating surpluses that the financial statements showed a year later if that were the case they should have remained at approximately the same level yet they're running 28 percent higher in one case and then three months later 305 percent higher how do you account for that? Mr. Prince do you want to turn that over to Mr. Zuloff? Well I think either of us can answer it that you're comparing with a period when for various reasons the profits were very low we had a strike in General Electric General Motors had a strike why shouldn't the things be more favorable this year when we haven't done it? No I'm not comparing it with the strike period I'm comparing it for the 1946 here they had exceeded the record earnings of 1945 by 28 percent and then in addition to that there was a 305 percent increase over that I'm not accounting for the strike period it's been left out there what I do want to point out is I believe that there is a reason for it and that is that all of you have priced your product to make sure that you don't have to reduce prices in case a depression comes I can assure you that we haven't and I doubt very much whether you can document it that anybody Well yes I can document it 1945 factory management and maintenance published figures that indicated that American industry was operating at break-even points on a civilian basis of 56 percent of capacity That was during the war? No no during the war they were operating at 37 percent of capacity on the all-out of war basis now I submit that when you had the prospect of selling 100 percent of your output fully three four years in advance of that date that that was nothing else but planning for a depression I don't know whether that was true in the particular companies that you represent but we are discussing industry in general and I imagine the goods that you manufacture figured in that itemization Well Mr. Shavitz would your contention be that wages today are too low? Yes We've been discussing prices and profits and let's get along to the third sector wages they're too low because they do not enable the worker to buy what he needs prices have gone up so that he his dollar and the value of the raises that he's gotten have been wiped out but let me get back to something a little more humanistic and a little less dry I think than the amount than the kind of figures that we've been throwing around here and that's the opportunity that we have all of us together labor and industry to produce the kind of a system that will be of maximum advantage to the maximum number of people in our country in the way of production maximum production maximum employment maximum benefits for all our people now I think that's a challenge to American industry on the part of labor if you will a challenge that must be met and answered well I'd like to get back to this question of wages and let me let the U.S. chamber of commerce express itself on this matter the U.S. chamber of commerce in the same month that it denounced the you know us fellas the profits of recession didn't evidently coordinate its organization very carefully and so when the monthly newsletter came out it gave out the embarrassing news that while manufacturing was taking place at an annual rate of $180 billion current income levels will only absorb a manufacturing output of $165 billion now there's a nice juicy deficit there of something in the neighborhood I think of $25 billion that $25 billion may very well be the source of a spiral downward I'd say we've settled for a wage increase at this time of about $25 billion I believe it was I don't I don't think either one of you I don't think either one of you really believe that the solution is a general wage increase would you prefer a price decrease don't you really believe now that there are areas of agreement here that we have I'd like to get one story in here if I may I've been listening to all of this pointing and all the money that we have now I'm wondering how much money you fellas have it seems to me that your memberships have been increasing and you must have a pretty good treasury now give us a look at that for a change oh sure well look then with your half-party act you're all good to go right at it yeah but they're not giving it out it's confidential I understand wait a moment as I understand that I'm not too clear on the law we've been submitting reports to the treasury under the revenue act we've had to give those reports for the last year so there's nothing well besides remember the fact that most of the unions have been publishing financial accounts for a good many years particularly the big unions and you know pretty well what their treasury amounts to oh we won't show you oh it's wonderful we want everybody to know how much money we have and can't they think of starting a fight we were trying to keep the ghost of the cast Hartley bill out of this economic discussion I wonder if we could go back just to see specifically what we might agree upon I take it I take it that all of you agree today regardless of where you put the emphasis that there is an imbalance between wages prices and profits although one of you will emphasize one factor rather than another do any of you think we're in a state of economic equilibrium so to speak in which all the factors are perfectly balanced and we can go on from there I would take it not no but I don't believe we'd agree as to which way the balance is out no but you would agree that there is an imbalance and therefore there is an area for further exploration as to how the seesaw might be made to balance more evenly secondly do you all agree that we need greater production in America regardless of what you consider the factors responsible for production there's no disagreement on that would you also agree that it is the responsibility of both labor and management to do its share in maintaining full production and employment or do you think the responsibility lies on the shoulders of the other fellow it seems to me since management is in the driver of a seat and is so jealous of its prerogatives it will have to assume a responsibility for whatever happens but labor must at least cooperate well we'll cooperate to the expense of discussing your labor causes with you but there are a number of other decisions that are going to influence the level of production in this country I mean we're already being made partners to the coming cataclysm I decline I draft you yes we're really on another issue here to what extent does labor want or will management accept the partnership of organized labor in making decisions on other matters than wages alone I think that was the question you were getting at judging by what happened to Walter Ruther they won't they won't well let's forget Walter Ruther let's let our guests follow up do you think labor has any role in assuming responsibility on the level of production and employment prices price policy and so on or not I don't want to put you on the spot here you're not putting me on the spot but I don't think that I think it's a team job I don't think that union or labor should take over any of the functions of management any more than management should take over any of the functions of labor I don't like the word prerogative well all right you call them functions but you keep both the function and the responsibility thereof well we in management are trying to develop certain technical groups as a part of management that try to figure everything out I'm sorry but our time is up thank you very much Mrs. McKelvey and gentlemen this has been a special program from the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University
