Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. Here now is our arthur, the rein save the world's settled in. The bertins start? The BRACHIPS 특별 everybody. The on Aberdeen. The End The End The End The End Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, mayor Pertuzio, as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. May the cause for which you have made our lives, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. May the cause for which you have made our lives, may the people of the city of New York. May the cause for which you have made our lives, may the people of the city of New York, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the city of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy, not only in Italy, but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the city's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the city of New York for your services for mankind. Thank you. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. And now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable syndicate in New York. It's building up the public'saringSS stance with lovely straightforward outlooks to the sanctity H śmal of peace. And today I spoke with the great privilege of telling you from the truth that I here, here we have an honor of promoting.

Impiniteri, is also here in Europe and is here in my city, she did not have only made a good visit to all of us. She also has a great honor to the city of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is also here in Genova ambassador of democracy, of that democracy that is so expensive to men of the United States, but so expensive to the Italians, especially the genoveses. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of democracy that lives in the United States, and so every citizen of America, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been given to the city, as she has been given to the high level representative of the city. So, this is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri, this is not only a visit of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and its own, which has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. This is a tribute to this household of the people here and the parents of the United States. This is a meeting that isagne its roots, so we are grateful for this and the population is in charge of this. and that has contributed modestly to reconstitue it, it is a salute of this man and of the Italian population to the great people of the United States, to the United States, which we are deeply grateful because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to give us freedom of democratic freedom when he intervened so potent in the war and to protect them today with many material sacrifices and of men also, so today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently because they have defended democracy in Europe and really in the world and well, on the impenetra, on the sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work because the democratic freedom will be really extended to everyone and there will be peace and work for everyone not easy to do for a few times we are not understanding we are not understanding we have to remember we have to remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just in the moment in which we were gravated by the weight of the conflict we were not able to do it we have lost the power of the country we have lost the territory in which our work could be exploited butae if we were killed we are able to do it in our resources in Copenhagen we are able to do it we are able to Generates work moral and materiality our country. It is with these sentiments, the Hon. Imperiteri, that I salute you and the city of New York and I say that we are tenacious in the work of reconstruction of our democracy in our country.

Grazie. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which mean so much to us and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
