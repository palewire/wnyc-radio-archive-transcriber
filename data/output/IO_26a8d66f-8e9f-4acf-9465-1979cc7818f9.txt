And now, friends of the March of Dimes, it's time to bring on the master of ceremonies of this spectacular show, the man who will introduce to you such famous show business personalities as Helen Hayes, Nadine Connor, Wally Cox, Eartha Kitt, Joey Brown, and the Ames Brothers. You know him well as the master of ceremonies of his own network program, the country's most famous editor of news on television, the star of today, Dave Garraway. Those of you who are here, standing with your open heads in the fresh air of City Hall Plaza, but with shoes on, as I think almost everybody inside has, will appreciate that this is a fine place to be working for such a noble cause, and there will be no better places found today. This even goes for the first group that are coming out here, and they're probably the most surprised people that you're going to see today, because they showed up without shoes on. They really don't have any shoes on at this moment, and that keeps them in pretty happy motion, too. There are a wonderful new group of Calypso singers who've come up from Trinidad with some of the great new sounds that Calypso is. Calypso, you know, is a kind of a singing in which you sing the words first, and then rehearse it, and then think what you had in mind, and by that time you're ready with a new one. No one can do it except somehow people from Trinidad, and there's a great new group out that have just won the international contest for such esoteric kind of singing, and you can hear some of them right now. The Trinidadians, L.A., if that's the verb. I don't think it is. Little children, keep your fingers crossed. Have faith in the bigger boss. We know that relief is coming soon. It could be today, tomorrow, or maybe in June. So little children, keep your fingers crossed. Have faith in the bigger boss. We know that relief is coming soon. It could be today, tomorrow, or maybe in June. Fathers and mothers in the USA Polio must go, no, it cannot stay Fathers and mothers in the USA Polio must go, no, it cannot stay Well, something with this disease should be rarely done Because it robs little children from having fun Rarely breaks my heart when it strikes a kid So let us all join together and make this bid So little children, keep your fingers crossed Have faith in the bigger boss We know that relief is coming soon It could be today, tomorrow, or maybe in June So little children, keep your fingers crossed Have faith in the bigger boss We know that relief is coming soon It could be today, tomorrow, or maybe in June With the adults who are grown and have experienced pain I have less when it attacks I must maintain So just imagine a little baby's condition When this dreaded disease takes its command The baby cannot speak and say Daddy, I am paralyzed But don't be grimaced and stare as though hypnotized This rarely hurts being a parent Even if you are poor and haven't A blooming sense for little children Keep your fingers crossed Have faith in the bigger boss We know that relief is coming soon It could be today, tomorrow, or maybe in June Keep your fingers crossed Have faith in the bigger boss We know that relief is coming soon It could be today, tomorrow, or maybe in June We know it attacks the body with its iron claws It steals our little ones by the trees and the foes Well, this disease, I say We must color Even if it takes our last dollar Well, scientists, doctors, and physicians Are helping the situation But while the grass is growing, it's taking time So let us hustle up this campaign The March of Dimes Children, keep your fingers crossed Have faith in the bigger boss We know that relief is coming soon It could be today, tomorrow, or maybe in June If you folks on the radio don't hear any startlingly overwhelming applause It's because everybody literally has written sound And this case is perfectly all right The Trinidadians that you've just heard Are going to take now, starting from City Hall Square here today A nationwide tour on behalf of the March of Dimes They were in the March of Dimes float At the Rose Bowl parade in Pasadena And won a big prize there They'll be in most every American city During the ensuing month During which the March of Dimes campaign goes on And we hope maybe you'll get a chance to see them If you're visiting New York today And going home soon from now I have very little idea how to introduce The next guest on our program All the cliches fit so beautifully And she sumounts them so completely It's my honor, let it put it that way To introduce to you the First Lady of the American Theater The lady whose wonderful talents have been adapted To every branch of show business Even now and to the strange vagaries of television I saw her on Omnibus a few weeks ago And she was overwhelming As she has been in everything that she has touched With her magnificent hand And she's National Chairman of Women's Activities For the March of Dimes And she's not very far away Miss Helen Hayes Thank you I'm sure that most of you Have made your New Year's resolutions I know that I've made mine And both of us You and I Know that throughout the world Free peoples Have resolved to conquer the enemies of democracy And to win an honorable peace But this month of January, 1953 Must also be a time of dedication We must rededicate ourselves To victory over another enemy The crippling disease Infantile paralysis Polio is an enemy that strikes without warning An enemy that has no regard for race Creed, color Climate Or community If you've followed the onslaught of polio Through the years as I have You know that last year This nation suffered its worst epidemic More than 55,000 cases were reported In all regions of the country And of course as always Most of the victims were little children But last year More adults were stricken than ever before Thousands of infantile paralysis Patients are still receiving help From the March of Dimes They are your neighbors and mine They must have care and guidance Toward final recovery Thank God most of these neighbors of ours Will regain a firm hold on a normal life For many of them Though the road will be long and hard And costly Today We must dedicate ourselves to their final victory Undoubtedly You've read About the encouraging advances That science is making in this war against polio After years of research Medical specialists Were able to tell us last year That they have discovered A temporary preventive Against the disease Now Now we are waiting Hopefully and prayerfully For a permanent vaccine To be developed soon For this Research must go on Friends It is for us to repair The ravages of the past And to prepare for any emergencies Of the future It is for us to give Our full support To the forces Who are gaining ground In this battle Our national foundation For infantile paralysis Is the leader In this crusade Our dimes and dollars Have been the vanguard In the steady Sturdy march Toward defeating the crippler Like many of you I have felt The tragedy of polio In my own family As an American mother I appeal to you today Let us all rededicate ourselves To victory In this fight Because of the thousands Of polio patients Who still must have care Because of vital medical research That must go on The need today Is far greater Than ever before Let us not wait Until tomorrow But join the 1953 March of Dimes Today And now By the end of this month There are two little girls Who will have the most familiar faces In America They're on the famous March of Dimes poster Patricia and Pamela O'Neill And these are the girls Who will steal everybody's hearts They have fought polio The hard way And won You want to say hello? How do you feel, Pamela? Pamela feels very quiet Cold out here, huh, dear? Pamela feels very quiet How do you feel, Patricia? All right Well, that's a good way to feel And no one knows better Than Patricia Who, as Helen says Has fought and won this battle Thank you, girls For looking so pretty In the middle of the daytime here We'll put them down now And away go The O'Neill girls Who you'll see In many places With those two handsome faces All over the country On the March of Dimes poster The one that becomes A part of the scene Every year About this time Yeah, she's here I just turned my head around To see if Eartha Kitt Was here And she's not very far away Those of you Who've seen Eartha Kitt In new faces Or some of the more blue Rooms Like the Angel In New York Have discovered A genuinely Electrifying young lady I discovered her I thought All by myself About three years ago In Paris I thought this was A great French singer And I'd be her agent And bring her to New York And let the American public Discover her It took me over half an hour To find out That she comes from North Carolina And knew all about that And all about people Discovering her More people discover her Every day Maybe somebody For the first time here From Monotonous From New Faces rather She's going to do The strange and wonderful Things she does To a tune called Monotonous Eartha Kitt Good morning Thank you very much Ladies and gentlemen 1953 is just beginning But I don't think Anything I do this year Will give me Greater satisfaction Than appearing here today For the March of Dimes 1953 is going to be A different year For the March of Dimes Or rather a difficult year Because of last year's Terrible polio epidemic Thousands and thousands Of added polio victims Are looking to the March of Dimes For help That's why more of us Have to give more of our Dimes and dollars this year This year we have A brighter hope And a better chance To conquer infantile paralysis If we contribute generously In joining the 1953 March of Dimes Thank you very much Now I'd like to do the numbers Everyone gets into a dull routine If they don't get a chance To change the scene I could not be wearier Life could not be dribbier If I lived in Saiviri I'll tell you What I mean I met a rather amusing fool While on my way To Istanbul He bought me the Black Sea For my swimming pool Monotonous for thirty days Salt air I sniffed While I was shipwrecked And cast adrift With a man who looked like Montgomery Clift Monotonous for what it's worth Throughout the earth I'm known as a femme fatale But when the yawn comes up Like thunder Brother Take back your tears My howl Jack fat made a new style For me I even made Johnny Ray Smile for me A camel once walked A mile for me Monotonous Monotonous Monotonous Monotonous I could not be wearier Life could not be dribbier If I lived in Saiviri Though I know I've acres of dough I'm not sure Of the amount It might be exciting Someday If I learn to count Shang Kai-shek Sends me pots of tea Gay Lord Hauser Sends me vitamin D And furthermore Ike likes me Monotonous Monotonous Monotonous Monotonous That was Earth the Kitt You'll not be surprised to know You can see If you're down here Or if you've heard her On some of the records That are going around These days The next man To appear For the March of Dimes Opening campaign Coming to you From City Hall Square Here in Central New York In the cool But clear air Is a jewelry craftsman By trade And he has a sideline Going now Appearing on the television And it's a pretty fair Little sideline There was a time When Those of us Who've loved him For many years And that's an old Show business cliche But in my case It's accurate Didn't think That maybe he was Going to get The rewards He so justly deserves But the public Thought so And thank goodness That that old Happening really did happen By overwhelming demand His television show Is on now Every week And charming All sorts of people From those who can see Everything he does To those who just look How wonderful he looks When you see him He's here this morning And his name is Either Mr. Peepers Or Wally Cox This one works Okay Well During my youth My most candid friend Was a lad named Dufo I shall speak to you Of him in the manner Of another childhood friend Johnny Fazula For your listening convenience We used to have A friend Dufo What a crazy guy Always makes us laugh You know when you're a kid You do anything for a dare You hang over the edge Of a roof on a board For a dare We've seen these guys Just trying to get Dufo To hang over the edge Of a roof on a board And We've seen a board It was a little thin board And we thought I'm going to hold you You know So he's going to do it anyway What a crazy guy We used to play Roof tag Everybody has to run Over the roofs And Everybody has to run Under the wire For Radio Or something I don't know So anyway Everybody runs Under the wire But Dufo Gets him right in the neck What a crazy guy You know when a guy Can't swim He throw him in the water He gets scared We've seen this guy Couldn't swim We just throw him in the water And he's getting really scared So I was telling Dufo Hey pull him on You know he's drowning He's turning blue Everything So he keeps pushing him in again What a crazy guy We used to play Backyard race Everybody has to run Across the backyard And climb over the fence And run across the backyard And climb over the fence And like that And Whoever gets to the end For his wins So this one backyard Every time we run across A lady comes out And throws things at us You know Water Pants Bottles Everything And her husband Gets real mad He pulls up a board With nails in it So every time We climb over the fence We have to jump over the nails So one time He's out climbing Over the fence Everybody jumps over the nails But Dufo Sixteen stitches What a crazy guy We used to take Different cars And drive it around We didn't keep them Or anything You know Some guys sell them We didn't sell them Or anything We used to park it In front of the police station When we used to With them Well we seen his car It was 39 Something And The keys is in it So we used to Drive it around So I said Let's go to Dufo's house So we went over there And left it on the front On the winning side And I said Hey Dufo There's my car How do you like it So he says That ain't your car You know He's real dumb So I told him Sure Here's the key I said Go ahead Take a girl For a ride So he gets in it He just gets around the corner And the cops Pick him up He's on two years Probation But you know something That's the only thing He ever done wrong Well I'll see you around And that's the saga Of that particular character The world seems to be Full of A variety of people I noticed that As I walked down the street Last Thursday They seem to be Signal differences Between individuals Occasionally you meet Some mean people Of course The gentlemanly thing To do When you meet somebody Who's mean Is to go quietly away I believe I'll look that up When I get home And I urge you all To do the same However With the diseases It's another matter The thing to do With a mean disease Is to pounce upon it And thrash it The meanest disease On my mind At the moment Is infantile paralysis Meanest Because It does what Bullies do It picks on kids Children And youngsters And Succeeds Many times In In hampering Their effectiveness Throughout life Fortunately We have A means For Beating up This bully disease And I urge you To give as generously As you can To the March of Dimes For 1953 Thank you The gentleman Who speaks to us now Had a predecessor In his job Who said That the city Of New York Should never have Been allowed to exist It is far too big Too wieldy Too unhandy For any possible city To be And yet We do give The job of running That city As great and frantic As it is To a single Administrative head Who is therefore Concerned with our Individual welfare In New York And the fact that New York's welfare Concerns the whole nation That's equally true Of polio And its effect On everyone In our town And therefore Across the nation And to speak to us This morning Here is the head Of our city Ladies and gentlemen My honor to present His honor Mayor Vincent Impeletere Mr. Galloway Ladies and gentlemen It is my great privilege To be here before you today To officially open The New York rally For the 1953 March of Dimes This is a serious And a solemn obligation Particularly this year Never before Has the March of Dimes Been faced with a problem Just like the one Confronting it In 1953 We have just come through The worst year In the long And distressing history Of infantile paralysis Throughout our nation More than 55,000 Children Teenage boys And girls And adults Were afflicted With this dread disease In 1952 Thousands of these people Have not recovered Thousands of them Are still looking To the March of Dimes For help Thousands of them Are still In need of aid Aid that will cost Not thousands But millions of dollars Because infantile paralysis And the cure for it Is a very Very expensive operation The National Foundation For infantile paralysis Is pledged to support This health You contributors To the March of Dimes Have obligated yourselves Because You have set The high standard Of humanitarian service Which the National Foundation Has carried out That standard Has been Never To turn down A request for aid From any Polio victim This Is the year When medical science Has at last Come to death's grips With polio This is the year When our doctors And research workers Can make the Greatest progress So far Towards Wiping out Polio From the face Of the earth Infantile paralysis Epidemics Have been getting worse But our ability To deal with them Has been getting Better And better A limited Temporary Preventative For polio Paralysis Has been discovered And will be used This year It is called Gamma Gobulin It is not The final answer To polio But it represents An enormous Advance A safe And permanent Vaccine Against polio Has been understudy For years By some of our Most brilliant Medical experts And now They have the Greatest confidence That someday Real soon Such a vaccine Will be available To all of us These facts Are heartening They indicate That our National Foundation For infantile Paralysis Has been making Wonderful use Of the dimes And dollars That we have Entrusted To them Here in New York City The problem Of infantile Paralysis Is especially Dramatic Here As in no Other community In America We have A mixture Of racial Stocks And religions Here As nowhere Else We are Constantly Reminded That polio Plays No favorites With respect To race Creed Or color This Abominable Disease Hits Everybody And that Is why Fighting it Is everybody's Job Fifteen Years ago The March Of Dimes Was founded By one of the Most illustrious Presidents That this Nation has Ever had Franklin D. Roosevelt Franklin D. Roosevelt Did not Know about Infantile Paralysis Merely By hearsay He himself Was struck Down by it In the Prime of Life He learned The hard Way About the Tragedy And suffering That polio Can cause And with And with the Typical Aggressiveness That made Him great He did Something Tangible About it His answer To polio Was the March Of dimes Your answer To polio Today In 1953 Is still The March Of dimes In opening This 1953 Rally Of the March Of dimes I want To plead With you To give This cause Your most Enthusiastic And generous Support Remember This year More polio Victims Need your Help But this Year We have The best Chance Ever To strike Some of The decisive Blows That will Make This disease Obsolete It can Be done You Can help And I Know That you Will Thank you Very much Our thanks To Mayor And fellow Terry For coming Down On a very Busy day To give An initial Shove To the March Of dimes As it Begins Its 1953 Campaign Here in City Hall Square In New York And the News that He gave Us About Gamma Globulin And the Permanent Vaccine Which has Been promised Not too Long from Now Is an Especially Warm Thing To all Of us Who have Given Dimes Before Hopefully To see That bread Come home Upon the Waters So richly Multiplied As it Has now The Calypso Singers That you Heard During the First part Of the Program Have been Taken In And warmed Up And given Wool socks On each Of their Two feet And I Think we Can go Again The Trinidadians Shoot Flying Can Newdes We are the music makers are up to date With the sentimentals, they're very great And the bebop and the jive, they don't hesitate Take for instance, Steve Eucalenton Call a competition, he haven't won But to have a good jump on dancers, you know You have to dance to West Indian Calypso So we tell you to jump, jump, jump Jump for so to West Indian Calypso Jump, jump, jump Jump for so to West Indian Calypso Because it is Mambo No bebop, bebop, no tango It's West Indian Calypso Mambo, no bebop, bebop, no tango It's West Indian Calypso Let's go back to old England Where classical music can never dance But when you drink your whiskey and rum With that kind of music you have no fun You have to sit very quietly And listen to the music attentively But we don't like it so We like to jump to West Indian Calypso So we tell you to jump, jump, jump Jump for so to West Indian Calypso Jump, jump, jump Jump for so to West Indian Calypso Because it is Mambo No bebop, bebop, no tango No bebop, bebop, no tango It's West Indian Calypso Mambo No bebop, bebop, no tango It's West Indian Calypso Let's take the South Americans They have a few good beats here on their drum And as far as you know It's the nearest rhythm to Calypso We have a few good beats here on their drum And as far as you know We have a few good beats here on their drum And as far as you know And a little more coffee It'll bring them back to life again That's what it takes on a day When the temperature is Well, never mind where it is Everybody here knows And you don't want to be reminded at home I hope You're going to meet a very pretty lady now Who combines two remarkable talents If you've seen her in the new Broadway hit The Seven Year Itch You know that you've never seen a lady Who can look as innocent And as alluring In the strong sense of the word As the lady named Vanessa Brown Who is our guest this morning Vanessa was a quiz kid On that famous radio program Out of Chicago a while back A real legitimate live and breathing quiz kid And grew up to be one of the most charming ladies In the movies and the television And on the stage today And let's talk to her And see what she has to say About the March of Dimes Here's Vanessa Brown Thank you, Dave Good morning on this cold, cold day I think all our thanks go to those lovely girls Who are not wearing any clothes this morning And it's so freezing Well, I have a message to give you These days on Broadway It's my job to get every laugh I can But I'm not after laughs today I don't have to tell you all That polio and fighting polio Is deadly serious business And I know, for instance That many people my age Some a little older A lot a little younger Were put into iron lungs On account of this awful epidemic We had last year And I also know that the Research scientists Are closer to a vaccine They're not bombing New York yet The mayor told you That we are very close To having a serum Which will cure polio At the moment It's only temporary But the research is improving And we hope in the next two years I think to lick it Research means money But research to us To you and me Generally means dry statistics But if you think of it In terms of children Who are most afflicted by polio Then we can understand it And maybe be a little touched And give a little bit more To the March of Dimes We all feel for children And to have them come down When they're so young With a disease Which sometimes cripples them for life Is something Even if they're not our own That we can feel for And therefore I'd like you all To feel that The March of Dimes Is worthy of your contribution And give a little more this year And so perhaps In three years from now We won't have to collect money Again for polio Thank you very much Every five or ten years According to the statisticians An act comes along Which becomes a show business Standard act A whole lot of acts Come and go And they last for a season or two Here or there But about three years ago Via the jukebox method And now the radio disc jockeys All over the country One of the standard acts Is getting to be one of the boys Who are selling more phonograph records Than almost anybody This is a quartet And you know them Not under their names Of Eddie and Joe and Vic and Gene But as the Ames brothers And they're all here this morning The Ames brothers Thank you very much Dave Good afternoon folks I'd like to say that My brothers and myself Are very proud To be a part of this Great March of Dimes rally I don't have to tell you folks What a What a very dread disease Infantile paralysis is And I think that you now realize That we're very close To a solution To this terrible problem However the one thing That remains The one problem Is a lack of funds And that's where You come in And that's where we come in And I know that We're going to do our best And we'd like to Urge you again After all the others On this platform We'd like to urge you again To get behind The March of Dimes Being four singers We'd like to kind of Offer you a musical invitation To string along with us And that's a musical

isn't done in our business But they really are But they'll overcome that somehow They're doing a great job at overcoming it right now You're going to meet now One of the great people of our business He is celebrating his 52nd anniversary in show business this year He started at the age of nine As one of an acrobatic group called the Five Ashtons I doubt if anybody is in our audience today who remembers the Five Ashtons But I'm equally sure that there's nobody who doesn't know the great man that you're going to meet Known by every GI and every theater of the recent war And in this war For the wonderful things he's done for them And for all of us Because there isn't a man or a woman living today Who hasn't derived some happiness From the fellow who came down here this morning to spread a little more Good He's a star now of the NBC Circus Hour That warms up every fourth Tuesday awful pretty And his name Need I tell you is Joe E. Brown Thank you Thank you Thank you ladies and gentlemen You overdid it just a little bit there Dave 52 years Look at me a child 52? Oh no that's way over That's way too much As a matter of fact It's 51 I'll tell you the truth That's on the level 51 years And Mrs. Brown and I were married over here at the Municipal Building Just 37 years ago The 24th of December And here I am back home again But ladies and gentlemen I didn't come down here to try to make you laugh But to call your attention to something that's very close to the hearts of all of you I know I know that each and every one of you feel as I do about children We're pro-children And so they told me that And that's my reason for coming here They told me that my presence might mean just a few extra dimes And an extra lift for a lot of kids who need it so very, very, very badly And so here I am doing something that's quite serious And I hope I don't disappoint you too much Because my business throughout all those years of my life Has been that of trying to make people laugh And there's nothing else that I want to do except that There's nothing that I feel is so wonderful as the laughter of people I believe that laughter is godly And love what I'm doing so much But this is different All those years, that's the one thing And now I appeal to you because Well, you know There are a lot of kids, a lot of youngsters That should be put in the frame of mind of wanting to laugh And if we want a completely happy world We have to have happy children And to have completely happy children We must have healthy youngsters Give them the opportunity Our kids are all good All children all over the world are good And people are good If given the right opportunity Just that And so these children have that terrible handicap And by your dimes and by your assistance The more dimes that you give The more assistance you will be giving to these children Who need it so badly And we can very easily say there But for the grace of God Stands, assisted by crutches and supports and braces Stand I Stand a person who is healthy and well And I think it's well for us To help those who are completely unable to help themselves Children And I'm very happy for this opportunity To come down and just say a few words And hoping and praying that it will mean something to you And lifting for these children I never want to feel that at any time That I'm disassociated in any way From those who are unable to help themselves And I know you too feel that way And so if I can just help just a little bit Just a teeny weeny bit I received a letter this morning From a youngster on the way down I opened a letter From a youngster in Burksville, Kentucky A child that I wrote a letter to And he said that I made him get well Because of the letter that I wrote And so just a very little thing Something that brought me great happiness The fact that I knew that it meant something to that child Can be the same to you Get that pleasure and happiness Out of helping these youngsters Let's all, not alone help ourselves And don't say just because the guy across the street Isn't giving We won't give Or look for any sort of an excuse Or wait for tomorrow But do it today This is the time to help The March of the Dimes March of Dimes Is the agency that's going to support it These ladies and gentlemen That appeared here this morning Make me feel that I am So very happy and proud To be part of the great business Of show business And so Thank you ladies and gentlemen For listening to a guy Who feels it way deeply down From the bottom of my heart Thank you Bye His heart's as big as his mouth Isn't it? One of the great stars of the Metropolitan Opera Is here in the cool afternoon air now There was a time you remember When sopranos for Metropolitan Opera Resembled a squad of observation balloons But under the new management And the new techniques That thank goodness Has been a past day for some time In fact the lovely lady we're about to meet now Has engaged in the newest kind of Operatic experimentation Under Mr. Bing at the Metropolitan The brilliant English production In English of La Boheme And she has made so many happy With her incredible voice Which will now fill this great cool space And part of your radio at home If you're listening Miss Nadine Connor is here Miss Connor Thank you I'm the mother of two children And I'd like all of you who are parents And I am like you I want them to grow up strong and healthy And I know just how you feel during polio season When the threat of the disease is hanging over our heads That's why I urge you all to join the 1953 March of Dimes As generously as you can In a moment I'd like to sing a lovely song Which is the title song of the March of Dimes movie short Which will be shown in theaters across the country Later this month It's through the years Through the years Our dimes and dollars Have helped the unfortunate victims of polio On the road to recovery Through the years to come Our money in the March of Dimes Will help give our children And all children A greater hope of escaping polio By paying for the research On a polio vaccine That will someday banish this disease forever So won't you please give all you can To the March of Dimes Through the years I'll take my place beside you Smiling through your tears Smiling through your tears I'll keep my place beside you Smiling through your tears I'll be near No matter when or where Remember What is mine I'll always share Through the night I'll be a star to guide you Shining bright Though clouds may come and hide you Through the years Till love is gone And time first disappears I'll come to you I'll come to you Smiling through Avenida Our thanks, of course, to Nadine O'Connor and Miss Henrietta Pelter who played the chilly Steinway for her in the cool afternoon air down in City Hall Square. The news that the mayor gave us a few minutes ago, which he repeated a couple of times, I guess couldn't be repeated too many times, but that we're on the verge of a discovery of a permanent vaccine to permanently prevent polio is almost too good to be true, and yet there it is. It's the kind of thing, I guess, that most of us hope for, kind of vaguely, when we gave dimes in 1938 and 39 and all the other years that the March of Dimes has been coming forward. It's amazing that we can do real good with such a, not ordinary thing anymore, but the real thing is money. We're used to giving money for lots of good causes, and we kind of see it go and say, well, that'll do somebody good, but we don't realize it as acutely as the good things that have come out of the March of Dimes so far and the fact that we're so close to the ultimate goal for which President Roosevelt hoped, I'm sure, when he started the March of Dimes many, many years ago. The complete whipping of this problem and the relegation of polio to that column of diseases that you don't hear of anymore that have been wiped out by the technical advancements that we have made, which don't just happen. Doctors and scientists don't just happen to study things. They have to live, and research is expensive, and it requires tremendous investments. These investments can come, of course, from nobody except us who might get it. And by, from the most selfish viewpoint, we are only ensuring our own lives and our own future by investing again this year as we have so many in the March of Dimes. So if you just want to be plain selfish about it, you owe it basically to yourself to give for the March of Dimes. Thank goodness most Americans don't seem to be like that, and that's why we've come so far in this campaign. The day that we hit the jackpot and get the permanent serum and the permanent vaccine will be another bright and blessed day for our country. And in hopeful celebration of that, the First Army Band, led by warrant officer Marion Durbin, plays now, God Bless America. We, when we are now, as we're here to come, and let's play it. The End The End The End The End The End
