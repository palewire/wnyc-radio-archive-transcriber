In the spirit of self-dedication to the high purposes with which these ceremonies are invested, we turn our hearts to the source of all inspiration. Thy Spirit, O God, implanted in man, doth move him to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thee. Thy prophets have taught us that the measure of man's merit in thy sight is the extent of his concern with the well-being of his fellow men. Millions of thy creatures inhabit this huge and multi-complexioned metropolis. May our chosen leaders keep their minds and hearts attuned to the needs of the masses of the people. May they not hesitate to vent their cleansing wrath upon iniquity. May they bend their compassion to the weak and the underprivileged. May they devote their talents to the improvement of our city's manifold services to all its citizens. upon him who this day assumes high office, an office to which he was elected by the people, we ask thy special blessing. May his vision of a community cleansed of its dross be matched by zeal of performance. May he be granted health and strength to endure the strain of public office. May he be granted health and health and safety of others. Patience to cope with the obstacles which may obstruct his path, skill to overcome them, skill to overcome them, and wisdom and resourcefulness to set ever higher goals for the progress of our community. Thy blessing, O God, bestow upon all who carry public responsibility in our city, state and nation. May peace reign within our borders and flow from our borders like a torrent to all parts of this strife-torn world. Establish thou, O Lord, the work of our hands. The work of our hands do thou establish. The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord cause his spirit to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his spirit upon thee and grant thee peace. Amen. If you will all remain seated, Mr. Halley will receive those who wish to do so in his offices downstairs.
