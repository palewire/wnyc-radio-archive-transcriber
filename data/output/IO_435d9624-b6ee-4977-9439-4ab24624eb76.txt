Everybody seems happy and bright like the day itself, and well, it's a great day for the Irish and it's a great day for history, because when the little people emerge, there's nothing to worry about. In a few moments, you'll hear the brilliant voices of the Police Glee Club, raised in song here in the Council Chamber in City Hall, and Mr. Whelan is about ready now to inform the Mayor that he has brought another distinguished guest to this great and wonderful building, City Hall. Mr. Whelan. Will you please be in order? The Police Glee Club will open the proceedings with the national anthem. I'll sing you a song, a soldier's song, with chilly rousing chorus, as round our blazing miles we throng, the starry heavens all of us, impatient for the coming fight, while we await the morning's light, till in the silence of the night, we'll chant the soldier's song. So who germs are we, whose lives are played to Ireland? Some have come, from a land beyond the way, sworn to be free. The Lord, our ancient style, and shall shelter the despot or the slave. Tonight we man the barn of will, in air in scores of the foe of will, with cannons roar and rifles the stars will chant the soldier's song. The apostle's song, for example, by the glory of insulares and hell,bijines all of us, the lice of outer небu, lead by staan. And will you please be in the heart of the tengu, by the stars of the paralysis of the Victoria, this morning's the only one amberern and while we are regenerate in the heart... The lord will happily be the worst, then, hogy japtop or deer dóna-kis 타?! Can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight All the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air It proved through the night that our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the lands of the free And the home of the brave And now, Mr. Whalen will make the introductions The mayor of

have given me Today here I will take this welcome As being a welcome Intended to Be conveyed To the Irish people It has been my privilege To be here In the United States When the Republic of Ireland Act came into operation I felt That there were So many bonds Of blood And of friendship Between the people Of Ireland And the people Of the United States That it was only right I should be here On this occasion To tell the people Of the United States Of the position Of our country Quite apart From the great many Ties Of blood And friendship That exist Between our two nations Probably greater ties Than exist Between any other Two nations In the world We have a common Tradition That is the people Of the United States And the people Of Ireland Have a common Tradition Of fighting For liberty And for justice We first established The Republic In Ireland As far back As 1798 That Republic Was established Then By Presbyterians From Belfast In our generation It was again Proclaimed in arms In 1916 So that The coming Into operation The Republic Of Ireland Act Was not in effect For the first time Establishing The Republic In Ireland That had been done Before It was merely Securing International Recognition For the Republic Mr. Mayor Has Referred Very kindly To the fact That we Have not yet Reached Our ultimate goal Our claim Is a very Simple one We assert That the Form of Government In Ireland Is a matter For the Irish People Without any Outside Interference We claim As much Right To select Our government And conduct Our affairs As any Other free Nation That is A fundamental Democratic Right Is the Fundamental Democratic Right Upon which Most other Democratic Rights Rest The right To nationals After determination No country No country In the world Has more Clearly Defined Boundaries A more Distinct National History Or a more Homogeneous Population Denial And we Claim That Britain's Interference In our Affairs Britain's Occupation Of a portion Of our Country Is a Denial Of Ordinary Democratic Rights I hope And I Trust That that Cannot long Survive In the Theer That in The democratic World That on This side Of the Iron Curtain At least It should Be recognized By all Freedom Loving Nations That the Irish Nation And the Irish People Are as Entitled To the Exercise Of Democratic Rights As any Other Nation Again I want To thank You Mr. Mayor Mr. Will And you Ladies and Gentlemen Who did Me the Honour Of coming Here For the Welcome You have Given To me I take That welcome On behalf Of the Irish People And the Irish Government I would Like to
