From the Red Cross Drive luncheon at the Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Commodore in New York, we're about to present His Eminence, Francis Cardinal Strowman, Archbishop of New York, who will be introduced by Mr. Jarvis Cromwell, citywide chairman of the 1946 campaign. The next voice you hear will be that of Mr. Cromwell. Your Eminence, Mr. O'Connor, workers and friends for our Red Cross. The Red Cross is an heroic ideal, the world over. In his essay on heroes and hero worship, Thomas Carlyle described the hero priest as one who brings great ideals to mankind, and who consecrates his life to making a God's kingdom of this earth. Such a man is our honored guest today, and it is most appropriate that he should be here with us. For when war came, unable to bear military arms himself, he followed quite literally the precept of the Apostle Paul by putting on the whole armor of God and going forth as an inspiring ambassador to our men-at-arms. He traveled countless distances as military vicar to the armed forces, bringing comfort to our soldiers and sailors of every race and pre. He knows firsthand what war meant to these men. He saw our Red Cross in its most dramatic activities, and he knows what it meant to these soldiers and to the peoples for whom they fought. Now he is returned from receiving honors which mark him as one of the first citizens of the United States. Born one of the best beloved in this city, he needs no introduction to any New York gathering. And so with pride and gratitude, we express our appreciation of his coming here today for this great meeting on behalf of Red Cross. And we bespeak a warm welcome home to his eminence, Francis Cardinal Spellman. Mr. Thomas Cardwell, Mr. Basel O'Connor, co-workers for the Red Cross, my dear friends. I need no expression of appreciation from anyone for coming here today. I assure you it is a duty and a privilege to come to speak for the Red Cross. The Red Cross is the foe of none. The friend of all. Uniting men in bonds of justice, charity, and peace, even midst the satanic struggles of war. In Europe, in Africa, in the Philippines, in Asia, in Japan, and in the Pacific, on sea frontiers, on battlefields, and in the skies, I was privileged to be with the boys of our armed forces as they lived, fought, and died together to gain victory and peace. They were the men whose characters and personalities may have differed. Men of all racial origins and of diverse religious beliefs. But the common bond of patriotism lifted them above disunion and discord, united them in devoted service to America. And in most of the places that I visited, I found the men and women of the Red Cross, working beneath her banner, with the red of its cross, the symbol of love, the symbol of love, and the cross itself, the symbol of sacrifice, united also by the common bond of loyalty, as unsparingly they devoted themselves to our boys, regardless of class, color, or freedom. Silence for today are the guns of war, but the war of the Red Cross never ceases, as unendingly she wages war on war for humankind and the peace of the world. From out the chaos of world wretchedness come cries to the Red Cross, I am hungry, give me to eat. I am thirsty, give me to drink. I am naked, clothe me. I am sick, visit me. I am in prison, help me. And because I know the creed of the Red Cross is an American creed, I feel that the strength of the plea I am able to make in its behalf is a paralleling plea for the tolerance symbolized by its cross, practiced in its work throughout the world. Every true American yearns and should work to promote American ideals of unity and charity. You and I, with all our hearts, deplore racial and religious intolerance, undermining the fundamental principles avowed in the human and humane documents, which more than a century and a half ago, chartered and charted a new way of living, the American way. If our country is to remain a human, humane homeland, in a world where millions are homeless, hence we must enjoy the spirit of those God-inspired principles on which our government was established and has progressed, for which the lives of millions of our boys were offered, and for which a million of them gave their lives. And during these days, so decisive for human destiny and universal peace, when America is least able to tolerate intolerance, anyone who incites, propagates, or cherishes racial or religious hatreds is disloyal to American ideals. Not alone for patriotic reasons should we purge our minds and hearts of selfishness and bigotry, but also because we should obey the commandment to love our neighbor as ourselves, the commandment on which the Red Cross bases its appeal. Give. Give. From the muted lips of our hallowed dead, we the living hear another commandment. Live in peace. For death still stalks the highways of the world. Hatred still mines the highways and the path of the world. The pathways of humanity. And man is challenged to obey these commands. It is not the creed of Americans to allow racial and religious prejudice to poison and pollute the blood poured from the wounds of the older nations of the world into the great crucible that is America. A crucible of common sacrifice, suffering, work, and triumph. Our creed calls for love of God and country, and a sense of brotherhood which we must learn, not alone from Valley Forge and Gettysburg, but from the sacred shrines of yearlings, the Red Cross is a patron of peace, promoting peace through charity. From her cross, she cries to us her creed, the creed of the Red Cross. I believe in the service of mercy. Wherever disaster calls, there shall I go, to alleviate suffering and sorrow. I ask not who calls, but where am I needed. I have no price for my service, but accept gratitude, that out of its largest I may expand my mission. I know no barriers of race, class, creed, or country. No barriers of ideology. No obstacles of rivers, mountains, continents of seas. Wherever human beings are in need, there I shall go, to minister unto misery, under my banner of merciful, fraternal love. An earthquake in Tokyo, a typhoon on the China coast, a typhus in Asia, a landslide in Chile, all these call a light to my heart. An epidemic in Alaska, starvation in Greece, ravages of diseases, fires and floods, in our own homeland of America. All these needs find me ready with my service. I know no distinction between French and English, Russian and Greek, Italian and German, Czech and Poles. I serve all because I am of all, having been born of the finest instincts of mankind. Faith in God and in his son's redemptive mission, which my cross symbolizes, and merciful love for all, which my crimson color declares. You who believe in me, you, so many of whom I have mothered in your sons and daughters, strengthen my hand and reanimate my courage, for I am the spirit of humanity marching beneath her cross.
