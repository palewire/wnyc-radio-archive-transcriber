What for? I've got a lock on the door That's the way to be Take and steal the rug from the floor That'll pay the fee For the things that I try Like the stars in the skies are on me Oh, I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I've got my gals Got my song Her head is a whole day long Do you complain it? Got my gals Got my gals Got my law Got my law Got my song I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I've got the sun And the moon And the people see The coast with plenty of money Got to pray all the day He's got plenty You're not the warrior Gotta keep the devil away Away, away I am a friend of hell When it's not a ride Never want me long as I'm well Never want to strive To be good, to be bad What the hell are you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of love here And nothing's plenty for me I've got my gals Got my gals For heaven Oh, I've got plenty of love Now, you complain it I've got my gals Got my gals Got my gals Got my law Got my law Got my law Got my law You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing I've got plenty of nothing from Gershwin's Forgy and Betts The choristers are under the direction of Florence Martirosian With Isabelle Laboree as piano accompanist Piano accompanist As theoka Withreso Boom Get vì bize Angst Đ millones Thank you.
