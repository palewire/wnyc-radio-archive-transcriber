He's life from the flow with a trail he adored as the band played on. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded. The poor girl would shake me off. He's there, he's a girl with a strawberry crown as the band played on. Sweet Adeline, my Adeline, at night, dear heart, for you I find. In all my dreams, your fair face feels. Your heavenly dreams, you're the flower of my heart. Sweet Adeline, my heart, we love. Sweet Adeline, my heart, we love. He's only a man in a fearless day. A beautiful sight to hear. You may think he's happy and free from care. He's not the most he seems to be. He's done when you think of a wasted life. For you cannot make me wait. And her beauty was sold for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a given day. A little brown car, a shady green spot. So happy home I find. My heart's barely gone. My heart's barely gone. I love only one. She's the girl I have to be mine. Boy, I love only one. See you when I ask. You can hear. And see you when I see you, you can't see you, shouldn't you? Oh, hey, she is just a place. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. THE END When we are married, how happy we'll be. For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady, and Rosie O'Grady the sea. In the coast of our time, in the coast of our time. Going through the shady lake, with a lady's eye. To hold her hand and feel good, and that's a very good try. Just leave your birthday home, see in the coast of our time.
