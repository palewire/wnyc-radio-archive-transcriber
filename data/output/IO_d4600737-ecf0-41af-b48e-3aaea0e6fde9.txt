The End The End The End The End It took a private ride in the squad car to get Mr. McGregor to the center. But when he did get there, he wasn't much impressed. Well, this is how we do it, Mac. We give the boys basketball to work off some of that excess energy. We give them artworks so that they can get a kick out of creating something themselves. But we need more equipment. Now, if we had some tools, we... Tools? So they could practice up on how to break into people's houses? Oh, now look, Mac. These kids aren't criminals. They're just neighborhood boys. Oh, most of them, maybe. But you got a few bad apples here. The hoodlums who hang around with Hank Travis, for instance. Maybe those bad ones will corrupt the good ones. I'm not worried about that, Mac. We've broken up that Travis gang. Hank has lost his power as a gang leader. Does he come here? Oh, we haven't been able to attract Hank yet, but we will. Maybe. Hank used to work at my store, you know. He was always stealing candy from the candy counter, so I made him delivery boy. But he wanted to drive the delivery truck. How do you like that? Well, Pat, I've got to get back to the store. The missus is picking me up, and we've given the new car a spin. Don't let me catch you speeding. Go on. You're too busy playing with kids to catch anybody breaking the law. Come again, Mac. Hey, Billy. Billy Brooks. Me, Pat? Where are you sneaking off to? Well, I've got to go home early today, Pat, but I'll be back tonight for the game. You better, fella. We're counting on you. Come early and help me put up the bleachers, will you? Sure. Sure I will, Pat. Hey, Billy. I'm over here. Hi, Hank. Smiley told me he wanted to see me out here. What's up? Come on. Let's go this way. Where are we going? Come on. I've got something to show you. What is it, Hank? You'll find out. Just down this alley. Well, how are things at the Robo Boys Club? Oh, things is okay. Say, I've got to go home, Hank. Shut up. We're almost there. Here. Behind the shed. There. Gosh. Some car. Get in, punk. Well, whose is it? It's my uncle's. He loaned it to me. See? I got the keys. Well, get in, I tell you. Some people think I can't drive, do they? Well, I'll show him. Where are we going, Hank? Center City. We're going to take in a burlesque show. Gosh. But, Hank, they won't let us in. I'm only 13. Besides, I'm playing in the basketball tournament tonight. He'll have more fun with me. Oh, let me out, Hank. Well, suppose I don't. What'll you do? Cry? Mama's baby? Suppose I told all the guys what a crybaby you were. Nothing you told the guys would matter to them. Oh, yeah? Well, suppose I told your pal, Pat Farley, about the night somebody broke into McGregor's. You did that? I didn't take anything. You're along just the same. That makes you as guilty. Now, are we going to Center City? Okay. How much dough you got? About 75 cents. All right, give me a quarter. I want to stop here for some butts. And I want to see you here when I get back. How'd I get into this? I don't believe this car belongs to Hank's uncle. I'll bet... Gosh, I'll bet it's hot. There's the keys with the nameplate attached. McGregor! Holy cats, what am I going to do? What am I going to do? Good afternoon, Mr. McGregor. I just came in on the off chance that you could match this thread. Why, Mr. McGregor, you're as white as a ghost. My car's been stolen. You're... Right from in front of my house. My wife saw the thief drive off in it. Oh, that's terrible. It most certainly is. The police. I must call. Oh. Hello, operator. What kind is it? Your car, I mean. Nice, I'll bet. Operator? Oh, my car? Yes. Yes, very nice, Miss Winkle. Very expensive. Maroon convertible. Operator! Maroon convertible. Now, where did I just see a maroon convertible? At last. Now, operator, I want a policeman. I know. It was just now. I saw it as I was coming down the street. Guess somebody else in town got one, too. Well, connect me, then, and be quick about it. I'm sorry, Miss Winkle. What were you saying? I was just saying I saw a maroon convertible in front of the cigar store just now. I remember because there was a boy at the wheel. A boy? A boy? My wife said she thought it was a boy who stole the car. She... Miss Winkle, that's my car you saw. Oh, my goodness. Maybe it's still there. It was just a minute ago. Maybe you can catch the thief yourself. And where did you see it? Right in front of the cigar store. Excuse me, Miss Winkle. Wait for me. Oh, isn't this exciting? There it is. There it is. That's my car. Stop, thief. Stop, thief. Come out of there, you. Let me go. I didn't take your car, Mr. McGregor. Honest, I didn't. Then what are you doing sitting in it? Well, I was going to return it to you. Honest, I was. But, well, I guess I don't know how to drive. Don't try to lie yourself out of this mess, my boy. Oh, please. I can explain. Save it for the police. The police? Are you going to have me arrested? And what did you expect? An ice cream soda? Of course I'm going to call the police. Holy cats. Say, Mr. McGregor, will you ask for Pat Farley? And what do you want with him? Oh, I get it. You're one of his basketballers. That's right. Ask for Pat. He knows me. Don't worry, my boy. I certainly will. I want to show that flatfoot what all that baby and stuff leads to. Come on, now. Let's get out of this crowd and go into my store. We'll wait for Officer Pat Farley there. Well, Billy, looks pretty bad for you, unless you speak up. What's the use of saying anything? Nobody believes me. Billy, why did you take the car? I was going to return it. I was trying to start it when he came along. All right. Let's have the story from the beginning. When did you drive the car away from Mr. McGregor's house? I don't know. I forget. Mm-hmm. Well, you can tell me that, Mac. When did your wife call you? Hmm, let's see. It was about half past three. That was just after you returned to your store after visiting the recreation center? Yes. But the car was stolen about a half hour before that. Uh-huh. My wife was trying to get me on the phone while I was wasting my time at that blamed boys' club. So the car was actually stolen before or during the time you were with me? That's right. Well, that's just dandy. And what do you mean, Pat? Mac, Billy couldn't have stolen your car. For the simple reason that he was there, too, playing basketball. In fact, I spoke to him just after you left. All right. So this boy didn't steal my car. Then, who did? Are you ready to talk, Billy? No. Where's Hank Travis? Hank? Wait, how would I know? Billy, why are you protecting Hank? He doesn't care about you. He lets you take the rap alone. I don't know anything about him. Okay, Billy. I guess I've still got lots to learn about what makes a boy tick. But I respect you for not wanting to squeal on Hank. I don't know why you should be so loyal to the dirty rat, but I respect you for it. He made me, Pat. I didn't want to go. He made me. When he got out for cigarettes, I saw it was Mr. McGregor's car and I tried to return it. But I couldn't get it started. You gotta believe me, Pat. I thought it was something like that. Oh, you believe me, don't you, Pat? Yes, I do believe you. Now, uh, you run along home and have some supper. You're playing a game tonight, you know. You mean you're gonna let me play? Well, I can't think of any reason why not. Can you, Mac? Huh? Oh, no. No reason at all. Oh, see you later, Pat. Goodbye, Mr. McGregor. Bye. Bye. Well, I suppose I ought to go out and pick up Hank Travis. Uh, you are going to press charges, aren't you? That's, uh, what you expect me to do, isn't it? Well, why not? Your car was stolen. I know. But that, that other kid, Billy, was trying to return it to me. It, uh, it kind of makes me think. Yes? Makes you think what? Well, uh, well, maybe there's something to this recreation stuff after all. That's exactly what I was trying to get into your thick skull. Then why don't you get boys like Hank Travis into your club? Mac, I tried to tell you why this afternoon. We don't have enough equipment for a program for older boys. I, uh, thought I could put the bee on you for a donation of some tools. Oh. So that's what was on your mind. Uh-huh. I should have known better. Well, don't I get another chance? That was As the Kids Go, produced by the National Mental Health Foundation. And this is Eddie Albert, saying so long, neighbor. Oh, don't go away. Your announcer has an important message for you. Thank you. Hi, neighbor. This is Eddie Albert, inviting you to listen to a play called Everybody Gets Into the Act. Listen closely, because it might be about some people you know. Might even be about you. It's Saturday afternoon, and Doris Brooks has the blues. Doris is that attractive war widow who lives down the street. We find her now working in her kitchen. There's a cake in the oven. And while it bakes, Doris remembers the way things used to be before the war. When she and Bob and their little boy Billy used to pile into the car and go driving on Saturday afternoons. Now Bob's gone. Billy's 13. He's been a comfort to Doris. But just the same, there are many lonely moments in her life. Is that you, Billy? Yes, Ma. Come out to the kitchen, dear. I'm taking a cake out of the oven. I'll smother it with a chocolate icing, and we'll have it for dessert tonight. Billy? Billy, where are you? Billy? I'm upstairs, Ma. Don't you have time to speak to your mother once in a while? I'm collecting my gear for the game tonight. Billy, come down here. I'm coming. Come on. Now what'd I do? You've been at that club all day. Don't tell me you're going back tonight. I'm going back right now. Right now? Sure. We're building lockers in the gym so we don't have to lug our gear back and forth. And then there's the game tonight. What about your supper? We'll get supper at the lunch wagon. We? Me and Tony Capelli. And the other guys. Pat Farley, you know, the cop. He's coach, so he comes along, too. It's like a training table. Training table. You'll get better food at my table. Oh, gee, Ma. Besides, I thought maybe you'd go to the movies with me tonight. And miss the game? Holy gee, Ma. I can't do that. Oh, right. I guess I can't compete with your roughneck friends. Oh, I gotta go now, Ma. See you later. I wonder just what goes on at that recreation center. In another part of town, Angelo and Maria Capelli found themselves in much the same sort of fix. Ah, Maria, don't be sore. I ask myself, what's the good of having kids? It comes Saturday and they all go off and leave us alone. Ah, kids is kids. They got to have their fling. Shoo, shoo. But six kids we brought into the world. Where are they? They're growing up now. They don't need us no more. Hmm, even Tony. Ah, don't worry. Mama Tony's okay. Hey, he's playing basketball at the center. It's a nice place. Well, you know it's a nice place. You have been there? No, no. But I know the guy who coaches athletics there. He's a nice fellow. He asks me to drop in to see the place sometime. Oh, so now you're gonna run out of me too, huh? I give up. I'm not gonna cook no more. Hey, Maria, without spaghetti I cannot live. Oh, sure. Now, Maria, calm down. I love you too. Hey, we'll both go over. What do you say? The recreation center had a lot to offer boys like Billy Brooks and Tony Capelli. First of all, it was their own place, where they could do as they liked. Then there was basketball. There was a woodworking shop. And there was Pat Farley, a man whom boys instinctively liked and trusted. Okay, shoot. Hey, come on. Stop hogging the ball from the backboard. Okay, fellas, take five. I'm gonna see how the carpenters are making out. Hey, you two. You're supposed to be working on those lockers. Oh, we was discussing something, Pat. Discuss it later. Get to work. Gee. You think he heard us, Tony? Nah. But listen, Billy. How'd you know that today's Pat's birthday? Well, he told me himself. Said he was hitting 35 today. 35. Phew. Gee, he's pretty spry, ain't he? We gotta surprise him somehow, Tony. Well, how about a present? You got any dough? Only supper money. Yeah, me too. I suppose we could go without supper. Well, how can we play basketball in an empty stomach? We could ask our folks for money. You ask your mother. She'll give you some. Oh, Nick's on that stuff. Why not? You scared of her? Mama's boy. You lous. Stop putting her right in that cheek. Sure you are. Hey, look out. Somebody's coming. All right. Knock it off, you two. Come out here, Billy. Tony. What's the matter, Pat? Nothing. Only your mother just dropped him, Billy. Ha, ha. Uh, don't crow so loud, Tony. Your folks are here, too. Huh? I'm glad they are, but, uh, we ought to entertain them. Well, how, Pat? Well, uh, why don't you two show them around the shop and the gym, and then maybe we'll think of something else. Okay? Oh, Pop, I guess that's about all there is to see. Hmm. It's nice the kids got this place, huh, Maria? Oh, it's a good thing. Keeps them off of the streets. I wish you didn't keep Billy away from home so much. Oh, Ma. Say, Tony, we got to get back to work. Oh, wait a minute. Hey, Pop, give us a buck, will you? Give us a buck. Give us a buck. How do you like that? What for? Oh, it's Pat's birthday, Mr. Capelli. Huh? We want to surprise him. Oh. Well, why don't you give him a party? A party? Yeah. Gee, how can we? I mean, what kind of a party? Well, maybe a nice supper, huh? So you don't have to eat in that lunch wagon. Hey, that's a good idea, Maria. You know something? We can have it right here. I will fix some of my special spaghetti. Sure, sure. Invite all the kids all over in the club. Oh, Pop, that's a lot of kids. Then we can call up their mothers and fathers and ask them, too. Each one brings something different. Oh, say this is going to be one swell party. What are you going to bring, Ma? Well, Billy, I don't think I can come. Oh, Ma, you can't walk out on the party. Well, I don't happen to feel like a party. Oh, you've got to come too, Miss Brooks. Hey, pipe down. Here comes Pat. Well, how are you folks making out? Did the boys show you... Oh, you're not going so soon, Mrs. Brooks. Why, yes, I have to. Goodbye. What's up, Billy? Your mother seemed a little upset. She's jealous of you, Pat. Taking Billy away from her. Oh, Angelo, shut up, you. Oh, gosh, I don't want her to think that. Maybe I ought to have a talk with her right now. Oh, don't go away, folks. Say, what about supper, Pat? Our training table. I'll be back in time for that. So long. Hey, Maria. We've got to get busy on the phone. Cold cuts from the McGregors. Scallop potatoes from the Schmitts. A salad from the Millers. All in all, Angelo and Maria corralled nine sets of parents and nine different delicacies for their potluck supper. There was much secret activity in the basement of the recreation center all the rest of that afternoon. And meanwhile, Pat had a little talk with Doris. I even gave up working on Saturday so I could spend more time with Billy. Oh, I don't mean to be unfriendly, Mr. Farley. It's just that I see so little of the boy. I can imagine how you feel, Mrs. Brooks, but look at it this way. Kids need a place where they can be with other kids their own age. Where they can raise cane if they feel like it. Well, that's why they like the center, I guess. Billy certainly seems to enjoy himself there. They all do. I coach them at basketball, but mostly I'd leave them be. Yes. Billy doesn't depend on me so much anymore. I suppose I'll just have to get used to it and leave them be. Sure. You know, I don't like to feel that parents resent the center. I wish I could think of some way of getting them there, too. There's enough room for all of us. Have you got any ideas along that line? No, well, I'm afraid not. Well, it was nice of you to drop in, Mr. Farley. Oh, the pleasure was all... Say, that's a mighty handsome chocolate cake. Oh, thank you. Would you like a piece? I made it for tonight, but Billy won't be home for supper. Say, I'd better get back. I usually have supper with the boys, but could I take a piece along with me? Well, yes, of course. No. Huh? I mean, I've got a better idea. Why not take the whole cake? And then you can all enjoy it. Oh, gosh, that's swell. In fact, I'll walk back with you. Well, better and better. Say, this is practically a party. Mrs. Brooks, are you sure this is where you want to go? This is the kitchen. The kids are in the gym. You open the door. Surprise! Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Pat. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, Pat. Well, what do you know? Oh, golly, Mom, you brought the cake. Oh, it's a beautiful cake, Miss Brooks. So beautiful. He doesn't have any candles, I'm afraid. But happy birthday anyway. Oh, gosh, I don't know what to say. I tell you, make a wish, Pat. That's right. Go ahead. Go ahead. Make a wish. Well, I wish we could get together like this more often. That's what I wish. Well, sure. Why not? We can have a family night once in a while. The whole neighborhood, just like now. What do you say? Oh, fine. On one condition. What's that, son? As long as you keep out of our way, Pop. Oh! Tony, that's not mine. You know, maybe we parents could have a club of our own right here. It'll help us to get to know each other a little better. And maybe we can pick up something useful to do for the neighborhood. Oh, would that be a good idea? That sounds swell. It's just what this place needs to make it a real community center. Now, I want to taste that cake. Right now? I can't believe that anybody as pretty as Mrs. Brooks can bake a cake. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. Mmm. Holy cow. It's good? Mmm. Wonderful cake. Oh, that's good. Gee, Mom, you certainly went over big. You feel different about the club now, don't you? Oh, of course, Billy. I feel that I belong, too. Uh, say, Mrs. Brooks, I, I, uh, I hate to presume, but, uh, well, the, the sample was so good. I'm glad you like it. I, I mean, how about me asking myself over for supper some evening? Well, well, any time, Mr. Farley. Oh, cake or spaghetti. All over the world it's the same. The only way to a man's heart. That was Everybody Gets Into the Act, produced by the National Mental Health Foundation. And this is Eddie Albert saying, so long, neighbor. Oh, don't go away. Your announcer has an important message for you. Oh. Oh. Oh. Let home
