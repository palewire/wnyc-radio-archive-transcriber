The National Broadcasting Company presents the Honorable Warren R. Austin, former United States Senator and now permanent U.S. Delegate to the United Nations. Ambassador Austin spoke earlier today before the 28th Annual Convention of the National Association of Broadcasters, now meeting in Chicago. Portions of his remarks were transcribed for broadcast at this time. His subject is, The American Broadcaster's Responsibility in the World Today. And now, Ambassador Austin. United States broadcasters perform worldwide service with the United Nations. During the past year, the networks and hundreds of independent stations have featured scores of United Nations programs. Many of them have been relayed to other English-speaking countries by the United Nations radio, as this one will be relayed. It is calculated that you have contributed more than $5 million worth of airtime to spread knowledge about the work of the United Nations. the message of hope and faith, which together we will publish to the peoples, is that the Charter sets the course for a comprehensive movement of world liberation. The Charter emphasizes that liberty is essential to peace. For the moment, the core of sanctity 3 and 224 numbers is Chun-Hed Hill Swan, which says Klein National skipped��� Надnational mankind in various ways. With the exception of the Security Council, all of the organs and agencies affect this cooperation by majority vote, majority recommendations. No veto, no walkout of a single member can stop action in those agencies and organs. Hence, the instrument for continuing liberation cannot be frustrated by any minority outside the well-defined limits of the Security Council. If parts of the Charter are being violated or ignored, as we say they are, the answer is not to forsake the Charter. No American would suggest that we should void the Constitution of the United States because its guarantees are not fulfilled in the same degree by every state. The answer in both cases is to use the basic law to build strength in place of weakness, wherever men can be persuaded to cooperate to that end. The world needs to be liberated from ignorance. Over one half of our fellow citizens can neither read nor write. the United Nations has begun a campaign of liberation from ignorance. New techniques for mass eradication of illiteracy are being cried out in Brazil, Haiti, Colombia, India, Burma, Syed, and the Philippines. This is only one of many devices that has been developed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization to fulfill an important promise of the Charter. The world needs to be liberated from hunger. Over two-thirds of our fellow citizens have been in the world community do not get enough to eat. The Food and Agriculture Organization has said that mankind must more than double its food production within the next twenty years. On many fronts, it is working already to surpass that goal. There are many five hundred million children living in this world community of whom nearly two hundred million probably will die of starvation. Many will be saved thanks to the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund. Last year, it provided daily lunches for six million hungry children and vaccinated several million more against tuberculosis. The world needs to be liberated from poverty. The average annual income of over two-thirds of the world's citizens is barely one-tenth of that of the other third. Roughly speaking, the average annual income in the United States and Western Europe approximates five hundred dollars per person. While the average over the rest of the world is less than fifty dollars, the average annual income in the United States and Western Europe approximates five hundred dollars per person. The value of the manufactured goods consumed by two-thirds of the people on this earth is less than ten dollars per person per year. The international bank and the international monetary fund are helping to promote economic activity. We are seeking to establish an international trade organization to increase the flow of goods among nations. The food there is של inclined to make the federal budget soundheres. Manager the world members face all over the holiday plan of daily lifecracks through either college, dia. The private school inspection and the personalertaics who enjoy the holiday plan, has been pounds of the day and novatiBlue. strangersagered from disease. Nearly two-thirds of fellow world citizens will never outlive the most productive years of life. The life expectancy for them, unlike to the 60 years average for us Americans, is somewhere between 30 members and 40-year containers. The world health organization is cutting down this waste. for us Americans is somewhere between 30 and 40 years. The World Health Organization is cutting down this waste of human resources. In Egypt, in Latin America, in Asia, it has sprung into action to stop outbreaks of epidemics that formerly spread virtually unchallenged, claiming thousands of lies. At the end of this month, not far off, the World Health Organization of the United Nations will begin a two-year campaign to inject every one of the 3,500,000 inhabitants of Haiti with penicillin. The aim is to wipe out venereal disease with which 25% of the population is afflicted, and yaws, a skin and bone disease of the tropics, suffered by 85%. The project was suggested by the Haitian government. Haiti, the World Health Organization, and the United Nations Children's Fund will share the expenses. The world leaves to be liberated from fear. Probably fear will remain as long as conditions create open invitations for ambitious adventurers and calculating aggressors. However, our collective efforts to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe did halt the westward thrush of Russian imperialism. Russian imperialist ambitions turned toward the east, where hunger, poverty, and political turmoil could be exploited with greater success. China, exhausted by years of war with Japan and torn by internal strife, has fallen victim to Russian imperialism. China, exhausted by years of war with Japan and torn by two countries. China, exhausted by years of war with Japan, and the Chinese people turned from a regime they believed unsatisfactory to one that they were told would be better. But the nature of the new regime is becoming clear. Although millions of Chinese are facing starvation, the Chinese communist leaders are obeying the demands of their Moscow masters for shipments of food. For shipments of food to Russia. Such actions as this ought to reveal to Asia's other millions the deep chasm between communist promise and communist performance. We try to make clear to the Chinese communists the dangers they risk if they seek to extend their military adventure beyond the boundaries of China. Secretary Atchison has voiced a warning in clear unequivocal terms. That warning, and the voice that uttered it, requires and deserves the resolute backing of the American people. Secretary Atchison has voiced a warning, and the power of the American people. Also, we must act with vigor, courage, imagination, and sacrifices to assist through the United Nations the peoples of Asia who are determined to liberate themselves. Secretary Atchison has burned down by women to the United States. Secretary Atchison has filled a year of only implications for mistrust, since not only from foreign domination, but from hunger, poverty, and disease.or unless we cooperate in carrying out the promise of the Charter, probably the Thighpipers of the Kremlin, with their deceitful tunes, will lead millions more to darkness, even to slavery! Available to us now are United Nations agencies that can promote and direct the release of human initiative in almost every phase of modern life. They are doing good work as instruments of liberation. They could do much more. Therefore, everything they succeed in doing increases the strength and vitality of the free world. One of the most important weapons in this 20th century campaign of liberation is the .4 program of technical assistance. It represents a major attack on this generation's most challenging problems. How to exchange and apply the vast store of technical knowledge we and they have developed. How to spread the benefits of know-how through the development of show-how. These efforts do not depend upon large sums. They deal in people and their skills. Not costly capital goods. Knowledge is the building material. The knowledge and skills in the heads and hands of people. And belief in the dignity and worth of the individual. These are the richest of contributions. The technical assistance program provides the means for applying them judiciously and productively. The task before us requires the total strength of this country. The energy generated by belief in United Nations promises could transform those promises into deeds. This would remove the causes of war. This would liberate mankind from its ancient enemies. This would maintain peace. You have just heard an address by the Honorable Warren R. Austin, permanent U.S. delegate to the United Nations.
