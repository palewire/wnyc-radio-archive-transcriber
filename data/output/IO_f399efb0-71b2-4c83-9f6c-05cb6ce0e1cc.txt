But she, on. Impeliteri, was also been in Genova ambassador of democracy. That democracy is so expensive to the people of the United States, but that is so expensive, so expensive to the Italians, especially the genovese. For this, on. Impeliteri, we are grateful for her, because she was a testimony and document of democracy that lives in the United States, so that every American citizen, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come she has been able to come to the city. So, this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, on. Impeliteri, this visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and its own that has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. It is, above all, the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic and has contributed to it, to the rest of this man and the population of the United States, and the great people of the United States, to the great people of the United States, which we are deeply grateful for, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made up to for us to be able to do it in the United States, when it is intervened so potent in the war, and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men, even though today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy, and have operated intelligently, because they have done it in Europe and in the world really in the world. And, well, onorevole Impeliteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work, because the democratic democratic freedom is really estetic to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. Forse, sometimes, we Italians don't understand it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just in the moment in which we were gravated by the weight of the confliction. We were lost in the city of Città-Care, territory in which our work could be exploited, and we were able to work, but the attack of this force, this democratic democratic freedom was so alive that we had taken our work, we had to work, we had to work, we had to work, we had to work, we had to work, we had to work to make it moral and materialize our country. It is with these sentiments, onorevole Impeliteri, that I salute you and the city of New York and I tell you that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of our democracy in our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo, in the search of your own land, is an example of all the Genoveses. The reason, not cred, contrasted by every man and the events of all of us, this man knew that this great land existed and looked at it, and looked at it, and looked at it, and looked at it, and looked at it, and looked at it, and looked at it, and looked at it, If you were LookingКon<|en|> that He wanted to find all theologically new churches… He wanted to try it, he doesn't have to find it but if everyone has to find it we will have to persist to find God, way more will we understand the road… that the vão other people were there and in peace with you both. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to general, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
