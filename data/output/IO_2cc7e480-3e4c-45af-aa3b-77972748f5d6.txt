From the world's most famous nightclub comes the grandest motion picture in years. It's Sam Koslow's glorious show of shows, bringing you Hollywood's topmost talent in New York's most glamorous cafe, Copa Cabana. Copa Cabana. Copa Cabana. Copa Cabana, starring Groucho Marx, Carmen Miranda, Andy Russell, Steve Cochran, and Gloria Jean. And don't forget those gorgeous Copa girls. It's hilarious when Groucho tries to play tag with the luscious lovelies at the Copa. How'd you like to see your name in lights? Why? Are you an electrician? No, but I've got some good connections. It's side-splitting when Carmen doubts Groucho's love. I don't think you want to marry me. How can you say that? We've been engaged for almost ten years. And wait till you hear Andy Russell singing a whole raft of tuneful, croonful Coslow melodies like this one. My heart was doing a bolero. My heart was doing a bolero. Under the star in Rio de Janeiro. Oh, holding you. I was dazzled and electrified while a tiny little voice inside seemed to whisper, Darling, this is the moment of moments. I don't remember were we dancing. Was it a tango? Or was it a bikini? All I know is my heart was doing a bolero. And you were so close to me in Rio de Janeiro. That was Andy Russell singing, My Heart Was Doing a Bolero, from the picture Copacabana. And now I'd like to... And now, I say, and now, Drez, I think we ought to tell the folks something about the picture, huh? Oh, I'm glad you brought that up, Andy, because I was just going to ask about your role in Copacabana. Oh, Drez, it's not really a role. Gosh, with this ham in it, it's a sandwich. Oh, no, Andy, I thought you did a great job. Thank you. You know, I'll never forget that scene where Gloria Jean is all alone in the office of the Copacabana, and you come in, and then you go... But look, Andy, why don't you reenact that scene for our radio audience? All right, but first I'd better explain about the love story in Copacabana. It's pretty complicated. You see, I'm in love with Gloria Jean, but she doesn't love me. She loves Steve Cochran, and he loves her, but he thinks she loves me, which she doesn't. So he starts making a play for Mademoiselle Fifi, only Mademoiselle Fifi isn't Mademoiselle Fifi. She's really Carmen. And Carmen loves Groucho, and Groucho really loves her, except that when he's around those 14 beautiful Copacos, I... Say, how am I doing? Oh, gosh, I don't know, Andy. Confusing, isn't it? Well, look, Steve and Gloria are right out in the wings, so why don't you three just do the scene and see if it doesn't explain itself? Just what I was thinking myself. Introduce it, will you, Drez? Ah, glad to. The place, the office of the Copacabana. The cast, Steve Cochran as Steve Hunt, the owner of the nightclub. Gloria Jean as his secretary, Anne, and Andy Russell as himself. As we look into the scene, Anne sits at her desk, clipping newspaper reviews about the Copacabana's sensational new singer, Mademoiselle Fifi, while Andy hovers over, offering some romantic advice. Stranger things have happened Stranger things by far Is it so remarkable If we can touch the star This may be just a casual fling Stranger things by far And then again It could be the genuine thing Stranger things have happened This could be the night And this glow around us Could be heaven inside For anything is possible Beneath the moon above Yes Stranger things have happened So why couldn't this be love Oh, sorry, kids I hope I didn't break anything up Oh, no, Mr. Hunt I was just going Don't forget what I told you Say, what goes on between you two? Oh, I have all the clippings for you Fifi certainly is taking this town by storm, isn't she? Never seen such reviewers Sensational Wonderful Stranger things have happened Stranger things Please don't sing I can't concentrate on these clippings Is there anything you want me to do, Mr. Hunt? Oh, yeah, I'm glad you brought that up I want you to go down And order a 12-ounce bottle of perfume And call up the florist And have them send a large box of flowers To our dressing room You certainly have to work hard To make the Copacabana a success Don't you, Mr. Hunt? Not half as hard as it'd have to work If I didn't have such an efficient girl Friday And don't forget about those flowers I have to go down and see about another act Hello This is Mr. Hunt's secretary Please send over Four dozen beautiful roses To the dressing room of Mademoiselle No, no, wait a minute Make it one dozen And Not roses Petunias Do you have violets? Yes? Good Change the order to one bunch of violets A very small bunch Thank you, Gloria Jean and Steve Cochran And now here's my favorite tune from Copacabana Je vous aime Je vous aime Ma Cherie Je vous adore Will I hear Those lovely words No more Je vous aime Ma Cherie I love you, I love you. I love you, I love you. I love you, I love you. I love you, I love you. I love you, I love you. I love you, I love you. I love you, I love you. I love you, I love you. I love you, I love you. But Lina... Don't try to stop me, there's nothing in the world that can stop me. But he's bigger than you, he could kill you. Well, that stops me. Thank you, Groucho Marx and Carmen Miranda. And now, let's do the Copacabana. Let's do the Copacabana. It's tropical food to your feet and make you be Latin. That's cause the Copacabana comes directly from the canyons of Manhattan. In the land that gave us the coconut and bananas, in the jungles and the bumpers of Brazil. No one there ever has heard of the Copacabana. But they win, you bet they win. Look at Senorita Watul and Senor Shapiro. As they swear to the rapture, they're bound to capture the ice. They're the envy of all the other Cubans at Ciro. As they cry, Ay, ay, ay. It is beneath your bandana. It's easy as spices, couldn't try six lessons or so. You'll be delighted to know. You can Copa de Copa de Copa de Copacabana. You can Copa de Copa de Copa de Copacabana. Copa capa no. Ladies and gentlemen, during the past quarter hour, you've heard some of the stars, some of the songs, and some of the hilarious comedy in Sam Koslow's glorious musical production about New York's most glamorous cafe, the Copa Cabana. It's the biggest, brightest, romantic musical fun ride of this or any year. So we know you'll want to see this lavish show of shows. Starring Groucho Marx, Carmen Miranda, Andy Russell, Steve Cochran, and Gloria Jean, with a gorgeous Copa girl. Yes, be sure to see Copa Cabana. It's Copa Colossus. Just another way of saying Copa Cabana. You can go for the Copa, the Copa, the Copa Cabana. Copa Cabana. Copa Cabana. Gresser Dahlstedt speaking.
