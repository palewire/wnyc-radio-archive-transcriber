She's my steady lady, most everyone knows. And when we are married, how happy we'll be. For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady, and Rosie O'Grady the sea. In the close of our time, in the close of our time. Going through the shady lake, with our lady's eyes. To hold her hand and see her good, and that's a very good sign. Just leave your birthday home, see in the close of our time. The End As I walk along the Wapu Long with an independent air, You can hear the girls declare, he must be a millionaire. You can hear them sigh and wish to die, you can see them wish the other eye, At the man that broke the bank at Monte Carlo. The End The End Don't you hear them sigh, don't you hear them sigh, There's a ringing bell, the glory of the day. Don't you hear them bells, don't you hear them yell. Let him ring in the glory of the day. Give them bells, give them bells, bring it up the glory of God. The End Two little girls in blue, lads, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lads, who won your father's heart. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted above. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow's last is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I'm true. Come, come, come, come, come. Ever since we were boys. Sharing each other's sorrows. Sharing each other's strides. The rest of the land was born, they blew my dear, I'd be kind. When they just read us, my darling, no comrade was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken. And the mother's scars have broken. There is just another missing from the old home that is all. There is still a memory living. There's a father unforgiving. And a picture that is all. Hold the wall. She's my sweetheart. I'm her boy. She's my honey. I'm her boy. Good real valley. Never to fall. Give her honey to me. Give my sweetheart. One evening in the month of May. Daddy, get the gun, get the gun. I met old Satan on the way. Daddy, get the gun, get the gun. I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die If you want to get to heaven in the good old way Oh, no, no, no I looked old sushi O- Ma stenou A Berkeley The jemand The beloved La with moon Johnny, get the gun, get the gun Good, my Johnny, I'm a slinger Oh, it brings my heart to soul Don't think that the I am needed At the front to fight the war Lay the white in your heart And I can't go on the day Oh, I need a beautiful party Who's I now in pain Of the Holy Role Of the grace of God Of the dancers leaving And of the stars are gone In your heart is waiting If you breathe the war Come to me Come to me Come to me Sweet Marie Sweet Marie Sweet Marie Not because your face is fair Not to see But your soul so pure and sweet Makes my happiness complete Makes me fall at your feet Sweet Marie Sweet Marie Where did you get that hat?
