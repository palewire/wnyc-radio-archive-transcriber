At night, dear heart, for you I find. In all my dreams, your fair face be. Your heavenly peace, you're the flower of my heart. Sweet Adam, my heart, sweet Adam. He's only a man in a fearless day. A beautiful sight to fear. You may think he's happy and free from care. He's not the most he seems to be. He's done when you think of a wasted life. For you, I'm a bravely brave. And her beauty was sold for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a gilded day. A little brown car, a shady green car. No happier home I find. My heart's barely gone, I love only one. She's the girl I left behind. She's the girl I left behind. Just one girl, only just one girl. Where are all the kind of art there not my past? I'm a brave and brave. I'll be happy forever, she's just one girl. I'll be happy forever, she's just one girl. Whoo! Who? Who? The End Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
