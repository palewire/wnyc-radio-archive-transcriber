The Senate Vice group, previous to the arrival of the Vatican singers, our own splendid singers, the Police Glee Club, have been entertaining here inside the Council Chamber at City Hall. The tremendous number of assembled guests here who have been invited by the Mayor to meet Monsignor Refugee and the members of the Vatican Choir and bid them welcome to our city. Out in front of the City Hall, the Fire Department Band, another excellent musical organization of your city that does so much to build up these public functions, has been entertaining the general public in front of City Hall and loudspeakers will carry every detail of the ceremony to the huge audience assembled in front of City Hall here today. The famous a cappella Vatican Choir has a very interesting group of soprano singers who range in age from 8 to 15 years and they've been especially chosen from all over Italy to make this extensive tour of the United States, Canada and Honolulu. When these youngsters departed from Rome by train to Genoa and boarded the Liner Sobieski, which arrived just recently in New York, it was the first time any of them had ever been away from their hometown. They have the satisfaction of knowing that the money raised on these concert tours that they are about to undertake will go to help the boys and girls of their own native Italy. The boys were aware of the part the proceeds of the concerts would go to the destitute orphans in their beloved country, Italy, that their brothers, sisters, cousins, and playmates, most of them orphaned, many of them ragged, starving, and homeless, would be fed, clothed, and given shelter through the Roman singers tour here at this time. Such funds are sent back to Italy, go to the furtherance of a boys' village, such as that operating successfully at the present time at Santa Marinella near Rome. This project to halt a juvenile delinquency was conceived and guided by Monsignor John Patrick Carroll Abing, the Irish-born priest in the Vatican service, and it is modeled on the boys' town, which our own Father Flanagan, and with whom Monsignor Abing conferred just recently in this country. Some of the members of the Vatican choir have been taken from these boys' towns being arranged in Italy, and now the familiar face of the Honorable Grove Ray Whelan always means that a distinguished guest is arriving here in City Hall to be presented by the mayor, and Mayor O'Dwyer, the host, is escorting Monsignor Refuge up the aisle of the council chamber, and now to the dais, where he is taking his place beside the mayor. The mayor elects Monsignor Refuge, president of the council, because he's occupying the council presidency, and in just a moment we'll hear the familiar voice of Mr. Whelan as soon as the distinguished guests are settled in their locations here in the council chamber, when Mr. Whelan presents the city's guest today, representing the Vatican choir, and tenders the choir through Monsignor Refuge, the honors and freedom of the city. Now, Mr. Whelan, always the unruffled, perfect host, is just greeting a few personal friends, making a few final arrangements. The members of the Board of Essimate and the Portsman are taking their place. And now we hear from our own choir, the Police Glee Club.

We have the police of Glee Club in the preliminary musical features of Merrill Dwyer's reception to the Vatican High Choir, or the Roman singers here in City Hall today. We're now just waiting to join some other stations before we make a formal announcement, and Mr. Whalen is standing by until all the stations are ready to join, and we can bring you this very colorful ceremony from the Council Chamber in City Hall. The Honorable William O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York, has just received the presentation from Mr. Whalen of the City's guest today, Monsignor Liciano Refugee, and he will now make his opening address in addressing the mayor and notifying which all the city knows that the guest has arrived. Mr. Whalen. The ceremony will be opened by the police club, Glee Club of New York, singing the Star Spangled Manor. Let's reisch �etten academy Square Lafar Child! Chic chosen Oh, say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched What so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say the draft's on the anthem Have I yet wave O'er the land of the breeze And the home of the brave And now Mr. Whalen, the Honorable Grover Ray Whalen, Chairman of the Mayor's Committee on Reception to the Roman Singers Mr. Mayor, Monsignor It's a great privilege for me to present to you at this time The Roman Singers of Sacred Music Representing four of the famed Vatican choirs Summit of the 3rd opera Cosmetics Loran and his Excellency Monsignor Rafiqe. Mr. Whalen, your Excellency Monsignor Rafiqe, the visiting choristers, ladies and gentlemen, a great New Yorker is listening in. He's recovering from a serious operation. He has contributed in his day as mayor of this city immeasurably to the cultural life of our city. In his recovery, I hope and I ask, and in your name I promise to him, all of our prayers for his speedy recovery. I refer to the former mayor of this city, Fiorella LaGuardia. Thank you. Monsignor Rafiqe and visiting choristers, again this city of New York is honored by the presence of the Roman singers of sacred music. It has been 20 years since the last visit of this choral group. Our world has changed almost beyond belief since those comparatively carefree times. A new generation, some of whose members have known nothing but starvation, persecution, and war, has grown up since last we saw this choir and heard their inspired voices raised in praise of God. They are here now as ambassadors of international peace with a message of tolerance and goodwill for all men. They are sponsored by a committee of Catholics, Jews, and Protestants whose ideal is to awaken in all men the realization that the cause of tolerance is the cause of peace. We are proud that they have chosen our cosmopolitan city as the starting point of a tour that will take them through the United States, Canada, and Hawaii. We hope they will take with them a warm feeling that New York is a kindly city, a city that is the home of the United Nations, is dedicated to peace, and a city that is fiercely proud of its front-line place in the eternal fight for liberty and brotherhood. In addition to their function as messengers of peace, these singers have another aim. They seek, by bringing to our continent, the music of the ages, to aid the poor children of all cities they visit, and to get some measure of help for the war-offened children of Italy. Theirs is part of a worldwide fight to save a generation. Theirs is not a worldly charity, but the true charity, a demonstration of the love that springs among men from a common love of God. Perhaps, as we listen to their sacred music here in our busy city, we may, as we reflect, know a few moments of true peace, those moments that are all too rare in the lifetime of man. And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's a high privilege for me to present Monsignor Refugee. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For the sake of medicine in the locker of the OcмоUS Files, theでもre you should know while I was in session of many people position over the care of our findet. In the dost committee of America, all theńst Sadness of America, we are, despite everything, always Hope to gleich serve this. This cordiality today is raised in consideration of the great good that the American people has, has made and will be done for our nation. Now, my dream, my dear, from my little to my grand, is another. That this feeling of fraternity between two peoples is still more intense, bringing it into the spiritual and the sentiment. This can be done in the best of the best of the way through music, which is the most profound and more efficient way of getting into the soul and really scaven into the soul. We bring here the voice of Italy, which is a whole voice of art. The voice of Rome is expressed through the most high manifestations of music, that is sacro-liturgical music that is ating to the being of God. I pray, my dear friends and friends, I have to say it and I have to say it, I pray to you this voice, this voice, and to hear it. We will have another reason to bring our hands with greater faith and with more alive hope. And now there will be a translation of Monsignor Refuge's speech in reply to the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer. Mr. James Murray will make the interpretation. Monsignor Refuge has expressed his thanks for the magnificent and warm-hearted reception which the mayor of the city and the people of New York have given to himself and the Roman singers of sacred music. The Monsignor stated that he felt that he and his organization were humble messengers of peace and goodwill at a time when it was needed most. He was grateful, and all of the singers are grateful, for the cordiality which the United States has shown to them, not only in bringing them here, but in the manner and the generous display they have been shown upon their arrival in New York. It is the Monsignor's highest hope that the Roman singers of sacred music will prove to be an instrument of international fraternity to strengthen the bonds of friendship and brotherhood which already exist between the United States and his native Italy. And he made reference with gratitude to the generosity which the American people have thus far shown in innumerable ways to his native land and to the strengthening of these bonds. The Monsignor then pointed out that he hoped to solidify these bonds of friendship through music, which is the best and the most profound language of international understanding and brotherhood and goodwill. The Roman singers of sacred music, he said, brings to the United States the voice of Italy, which as everyone knows is the voice of art. It brings the voice of Rome, and it brings it not only in terms of music, but in a deeper sense in terms of sacred music, which brings the bond of fraternity closer to the watchful eye of Almighty God. The Monsignor prays that the American people will give to the Roman singers of sacred music and the art which they symbolize the same warm welcome that they have received here, and that they will listen attentively to the message of this music, and he hopes that it will constitute a permanent handshake of friendship between the two countries. The Roman singers of sacred music will now render two numbers and one encore. I say one encore because the time on the air is limited, and then, regardless of the fact that they represent sacred music, they shall be challenged by the police glee club of New York. It's taking a little time now for Monsignor Refuge to go from the rostrum to the director's podium here in the council chamber in City Hall, where the Roman singers will now be heard in just a moment. Monsignor Refuge is taking his place. Somebody is grabbing mics and shoving them around, apparently by the way they handle them, they're not radio people, but we hope that finally the locations will be all right, and you'll hear the music of the Roman singers directed by their inspired leader, Monsignor Licinio Refuge. Immediately following theirs, as Mr. Whalen so humorously announced, the police glee club will challenge, and we feel quite sure that we'll hear some fine music then too. Monsignor is going among the choir maybe for a few moments of advisory leadership, and in just a moment now we'll hear these voices from ancient Rome. Monsignor Montage V akh complexityVIDii fouti rm NOTRCING ARRA SONG INJUSTINE conect larg Monday healthyarem Тушка Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

And now the encore. And we're just waiting now for the choir for a final advisory discussion of the number they're about to sing. And we're just waiting now for him to step back to his directing place before the choir. And we'll hear this final and encore number by the Roman singers. It seems Monsignor Refugee is very much at home, not very much concerned with fleeting radio time. And we're just waiting now for the encore number. The consultation is still underway. And now Monsignor's about ready to start the promised encore number. If the new moves run according to Mr. Whalen's statement, there were to be three numbers in all. And this naturally will be the third. There's still a matter of discussion. Monsignor's talking to one or two members of the choir. And now here is the number which we think is the encore. Monsignor's talking to one or two members of the choir. Monsignor's talking to one or two members of the choir. Monsignor's talking to one or two members of the choir. Monsignor's talking to one or two members of the choir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And with the words, hallelujah, we conclude the broadcast of the Roman Singers from the Council Chamber in City Hall, where Merrow Dwyer is host of the Roman Singers and their director and distinguished company, Monsignor Refugee, and those accompanying the singers. We return now to our studios. There's no doubt about the enthusiasm which the Roman Singers have created here in the absolutely crowded Metropolitan Opera City Council concert hall. Monsignor Refugee is now returning to the Rostron to be seated beside Merrow Dwyer. Now, Mr. Whelan. Those listening in on the air, I'm quite sure that no presiding officer would take the privilege and the pleasure from Merrow Dwyer of introducing the next choristers. Mr. Whelan, Monsignor Refugee, choruses, and ladies and gentlemen, we have had a rare privilege, and you have indicated your appreciation of it by your applause and the fact that you stood up and cheered those visitors. Now, the schedule for today called for a final number by the Police Glee Club. Boys, do you want to sing or go back to traffic? You want to sing? All right. All right. That, ladies and gentlemen, is symbolic of the courage of our police department. I have been informed by Sergeant Dillon that the Police Glee Club will sing, but not to challenge the choruses. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The police glee club, the sign of the police is preparing, as they say, not challenge the Vatican or Roman singers by singing in Russian, the Lord have mercy as their first number. Sergeant Dillon is now preparing the second number. What is it? Benedictus who's? Gunos Benedictus. Thank you. Just sit here. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh.

And now the grand recessional from the council chamber in City Hall where the police glee club leading the way and followed by the Roman singers in their very interesting cassocks and surpluses they're wearing purple cassocks trimmed with red and surpluses of white linen and the lace and as the police glee club so gallantly stated when Mr. Whalen announced that they would challenge or the mayor Maestro O'Dwyer announced that they would challenge the Roman singers the gallant policeman stepped up and said we will sing but not challenge which is an indication of the courtesy with which the police department meets every situation in New York City they think on their feet they know the prodigal of life they're close to it all the time on the streets and may we say that in their beautiful singing which they offered in the contrast to the Vatican or Roman singers today we have to remind you that they are not only singers they stand out in the rain and snow and the traffic and the heat like the letter carriers neither sleep nor slow nor rain or any of the other situations interfere with the fact that they are primarily police but they rise to the occasion of the morning of the city hall today they have the distinct care privilege by listening to the beautiful sacred music of the Roman singers under the direction of their inspired leader Monsignor Ruggino Refuge whose music is included in our own masterwork bulletin in the presentation of masterwork on your city station and who was here in person today as the guest of the mayor with his choir and the people of the city of New York New York is a wonder city sooner or later everything in the world comes to New York and everything in the world happens here that is good and may we say that the closing musical number was benedictus qui venet and nomine domine blessed are they who come in the name of the Lord we turn you now to our studios in the municipal building
