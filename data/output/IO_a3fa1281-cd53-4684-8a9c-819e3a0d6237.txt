Something tells me I am near that the front to fight the foe. He was soldier boys on marching and I can no longer stay ah I hear the beautiful calling Goodbye darling pray. Come on down south, way way down south where the sun shines every day soft skies of blue shine down anew and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay.

Where ever I go, they shout, hello. Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir, but not goodbye. The past is dead, love cannot die. We're better far had we not met. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. Give me your answer too. I love crazy. Oh, for the love of you. It won't be a striving marriage. I can't afford a family. But you love me. Oh, I love me. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. For joy, love, and praise the U.S. sing, and when the birds stand true, In the forest of the desert, we'll have to rise to your cross tonight. Sing it when you hear the earth, the things in me. For joy, love, and praise the U.S. sing, and when the birds stand true, In the forest of the desert, we'll have to rise to your cross tonight. Sing it when the birds stand true, In the forest of the desert, we'll have to rise to your cross tonight.
