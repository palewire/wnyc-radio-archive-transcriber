Grant unto him, O Lord, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and ghostly strength, the spirit of knowledge and true godliness, that he may discern the truth and impartially administer the law in the fear of thee alone. In the time of prosperity, fill his heart with thankfulness, and in the day of trouble, suffer not his trust in thee to fail, all of which we ask of thee, O Father Almighty, world without end. Amen.

EVERYBODY IN THE CONSUL CHAMBER RISES TO SALUTE MS. LAGARDIA, WHO IS ABOUT TO MAKE A PRESENTATION. THIS GAVEL OF FIORELLO'S IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE HE USED IT FOR SO MANY YEARS. IT WAS GIVEN TO HIM AT THE DEDICATION OF THE MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, NOW CALLED LAGARDIA FIELD, AND HE WAS SO PROUD OF THAT ACHIEVEMENT THAT THIS IS THE ONE HE USED NOT ONLY AS MAYOR, BUT WHEN HE ALSO PRESIDED AS DIRECTOR GENERAL OF UNRWA AT THEIR SESSIONS. IN GIVING YOU THIS GAVEL TODAY, RUDY, IT JUST SHOWS OUR CONFIDENCE IN YOU. WE ARE MANY HERE TODAY WHO HAVE BEEN STRIVING AND WORKING TO BRING BACK GOOD GOVERNMENT TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK, AND WE FEEL THAT YOU NOW ARE GOING TO CARRY ON FOR US. AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO USE THIS AS A SIMPLE. MS. LAGARDIA IS NOW PRESENTING PERSONALLY THE GAVEL TO MR. RUDOLPH HALLIE. THE ORIBLE RUDOLPH HALLIE, WHO HAS JUST BEEN SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF NEW YORK. THANK YOU, MARIE. I REGARD THIS GAVEL AS A SYMBOL OF DEDICATION TO PUBLIC OFFICE, OF COMPLETE INTEGRITY IN PUBLIC OFFICE, AND OF DECENT, HONEST, AND EFFICIENT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION BY A FEARLESS MAN. IN HOLDING THIS GAVEL, MARIE, I WILL FEEL THAT I AM HOLDING THE HOPES AND THE ASPIRATIONS OF MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, AND CERTAINLY MY OWN HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS. ON THIS OCCASION, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT HAVING, BY THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK CITY, AND WITH THE BLESSING AND THE AID OF THE LORD, UNDERTAKEN THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE CITY COUNCIL, IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT I PUBLICLY STATE MY CONCEPT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH I AM ACCEPTING, AND MY CONCEPT OF THE DEDICATION WHICH I AM MAKING. I BELIEVE THAT WE, PEOPLE OF NEW YORK CITY, HAVE GIVEN ME A MANDATE, A JOB TO DO, A JOB WHICH I MUST DO, AND MUST DO WITH ALL OF MY ABILITY, AND NEVER SHRINKING FROM IT, A JOB WHICH HAS DEFINITE CONFINENTS AND LIMITATIONS, AND TO WHICH I SHOULD LIMIT MYSELF SO THAT I CAN GIVE ALL OF MY ENERGYS AND ACTIVITIES TO THE TASK AT HAND. I BELIEVE THAT MANDATE IS TO USE EVERY EFFORT WITHIN THE LEGAL, CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS OF MY OFFICE, IN COOPERATION WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN OFFICE, TO BRING ABOUT CLEAN, DECENT, EFFICIENT, MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT. I BELIEVE THAT THAT MEANS THAT I CANNOT PLEASE ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME. I BELIEVE THAT I WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO DO THAT WHICH IS, IN MY OPINION, RIGHT, AFTER I HAVE SOUGHT AND CAREFULLY WEIGHED EXPERT ADVICE AND RECEIVED THE HELP OF THE MANY PEOPLE UPON WHOM I KNOW I CAN COUNT, AND ON WHOM I SHOULD SAY I KNOW WE, THE PEOPLE, CAN COUNT, FOR AID AND ASSISTANCE IN THIS JOB. MY ELECTION CAME AFTER I HAD MADE A NUMBER OF STATEMENTS AS TO POLICY. OF THESE I WILL NOT BE UNMINDFUL. THEY WILL ALWAYS BE IN THE FOREFRONT IN EVERY ACTIVITY. AND I SHALL CONSTRUE THIS MANDATE TO MEAN THAT I SHALL ENGAGE IN ACTIVITY AS THE INDEPENDENT WHO HAS BEEN ELECTED, TURNING NEITHER TO ONE SIDE NOR TO THE OTHER, BUT SERVING ALL OF THE PEOPLE FAITHFULLY THROUGHOUT MY TERM OF OFFICE. AND I THANK THOSE IN THIS ROOM, EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, ON BEHALF OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK. THANK YOU. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . may they devote their talents to the improvement of our city's manifold services to all its citizens. Upon him who this day assumes high office, an office to which he was elected by the people, we ask thy special blessing. May his vision of a community cleansed of its dross be matched by zeal of performance. May he be granted health and strength to endure the strain of public office. May his vision of a new world. May his vision of a new world. Patience to cope with the obstacles which may obstruct his path, skill to overcome them, and wisdom and resourcefulness to set ever higher goals for the progress of our community. Thy blessing, O God, bestow upon all who carry public responsibilities in our city, state, and nation. May peace reign within our borders and flow from our borders like a torrent to all parts of this strife-torn world. Establish thou, O Lord, the work of our hands. The work of our hands do thou establish The Lord bless thee and keep thee The Lord cause his spirit to shine upon thee And be gracious unto thee The Lord lift up his spirit upon thee And grant thee peace Amen If you will all remain seated Mr. Halley will receive those who wish to do so In his offices downstairs But I would like you to remain seated until the members of the board of estimate the council can go leave the room Radio's microphones this morning have brought you the oath-taking ceremony of the Honorable Rudolph Halley Who has just been sworn in as president of the City Council of the City of New York?
