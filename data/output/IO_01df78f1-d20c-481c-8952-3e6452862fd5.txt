If I had the ober That our friend Mr. Burrell has here I could answer him But if you also had my hair It would be alright The war emergency board Of the fur industry Composed of labor And management organizations In the industry Has done an outstanding job In its war effort activities It has sponsored The previous war bond drive The salvage drive The blood donors drive And through its war chest Recently distributed $250,000 To war relief agencies Of the allied nations The board's greatest gesture Was the creation Of the fur vest project Which is now Of national scope And operation Thousands of fur line vests Have been distributed To brave merchant seamen Of the allied merchant marine And this project Is to be continued Indefinitely To ensure a steady flow Of these vests For the duration Of the war This project Was made possible Through the patriotism And generosity Of the fur workers Many of you Within the hearing Of my voice Are giving unstintingly Of your time And labor For this most worthy cause And I'm sure You'll continue To do so We are here today To ask you To make another contribution But one which will not Require your time Or even effort The United States government Is asking you To put your money Into the finest And safest investment In the world Not only will you receive A good rate of interest And ensure yourself Against poverty And distress In the years to come But these bonds Will pay big dividends In victory Freedom And the peaceful Pursuit of happiness Bring those boys Over there back quicker By backing them up With your dollars Over here And now it is my Extreme pleasure To present to you A dynamic personality A real friend Of the fur industry A man who has been Untiring In his duty And devotion To his country And his city His honor The mayor of New York Fiorella LaGuardia Mr. Chairman Benny Who said this was A ghost town I wish Some of these employers Were trying to bring back Starvation wages And the sweatshops And Macy's And Bloomingdale's And Abraham and Strauss Could come here And see this ground And incidentally While we're fighting This war We are not going to permit Labor standards To be brought down Now let Bloomingdale And Macy And Abraham and Strauss And Lord and Taylor Take note of that And perhaps Look at their own payrolls And give their employees A better birth You know Ben Gold asked me To come here To make an appeal For this Second war loan And after he asked me To come here And make the appeal He just now told me You're oversubscribed Already And of course I know That the fur industry Will come through As they always do You know As I said last night At Carnegie Hall The matter is very simple We either Loan the money To our government And get it back With interest Or else Hitler and the Japs Will come over here And take it away from us We get nothing And we're not going to Let them come over here And that is why We want to make this Second war loan Not only successful We want to Oversubscribe it And I am sure That the flourishing Prospering Great industrial town Of New York Will lead the whole procession Now of course We have no illusions About this men It's going to be A long And difficult War There's no doubt As to the outcome But we must do A complete job And that means That there is a great deal Of hard and difficult Fighting ahead The news this week Is rather encouraging The French The British And our American troops Are chasing Rummel And his army Into the waters Of the Bay of Tunis The army Of the Soviet Republicans Are pushing back Every attempt Of the Nazi forces To break through Again The Russian army Has now The Nazi army In the mud Up to their knees And pretty soon They'll have them In the mud Up to their necks It wasn't so many weeks ago When Hitler Was making preparations For his march Into Moscow And as I told you At the meeting Madison Square Garden The only time The Nazi army Will see Moscow Will be when they'll be Taken there As prisoners of war And yet As I say There's a great deal More fighting To be done And we have to fight Until We've beaten And crushed And destroyed And destroyed The Japs Hitler And his little pal Mussolini too None of them Are any good And never were Any good And some of us Knew that They were no good All of the time So I want to congratulate The fur industry Of New York City Employers And the organized Workers Of the fur industry In getting An early start In this War loan In setting the example To other industries And I know That you'll make good For your country This time As you always Make good This war Is not

I'm going to retire, ladies and gentlemen, as your master's ceremony, and turn this program over to one whom you all know, and I think, and I believe, and I'm sure you respect. He's a business manager at the Furrier's Joint Council. He is one of the most elegant voices of Labour. He's been, in a large measure, responsible for the success of this rally. And his associates in the union have given their time and energy in the handling of arrangements. May I present to you, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Irving Potash, and thank you, and good afternoon. Now, first of all, let's express en masse thanks to Mr. Milton Pearl for his generosity and his kindness to come here and be with us and introduce everybody. Give the hand now, everybody. Thank you, Mr. Irving Potash. Thank you, Mr. Irving Potash. Thank you, Mr. Irving Potash. Thank you, Mr. Irving Potash. Secondly, let me inform you that you stay on, and if you get into the shop a half hour or more later, you will be permitted to work it off, so stay until the meeting is over. And thirdly, let's see whether we can take our hands out of our pockets, all of us here. This is not just a meeting for the speakers from the platform. This is a meeting where all of you will have to speak. Those of you on the sides, all over, take your hands out of your pockets, and the rest of you to the right of me and those in the front. Let the gentlemen from the Treasury Department, let the United States government representatives know that you are here not only to listen to speeches, but you are here to demonstrate your readiness to support with money and with everything until we smash Hitlerism and wipe them off the face of the earth. Get your hands out and put them up and this pledge to the United States government representatives here. Let's see your hands. Take them out of your pockets. Let's see this pledge from everybody here at this audience. Come up with your hands. Take them out. They won't freeze. All over down the other side. Express your opinion and your determination. Next. You have on this platform for workers, women, mothers, members of our union, workers in this industry who have given their sons in the United States armed forces, some of them two sons, some of them three, some of them their sons and daughters, some of them sitting on this platform, your sisters, working with you in your shops, members of your union, have had their sons over on the other side who have already made their supreme sacrifice, who have already laid down their lives so that you and I and the rest of us in this world may live free of the boot of Hitler. They are right here the mothers, your sisters, and your fellow members of your union and your industry. You have here a mother of a hero. You have read the news in the newspapers only the other day of a member of our union, a young worker by the name of Abrams who was a lieutenant in one of the bombers, fortresses, that sunk three German ships in the Atlantic. That hero's mother is right here on this platform. These mothers have given their sons and the United States Treasury Department is calling upon us to give money to buy bonds so that the United States government may be able to buy the best that the American people and the American workers can produce, the best ships, the best trains, the best tanks and guns to their sons and the sons of millions more to put an end to Hitlerism, to put an end to slavery, to bring about the world free of the threats, free of the slavery imposed by Hitler and the conquered people to bring about a better and freer world for all of us. These are the mothers here who have sent their sons for that purpose. Last night, the Secretary of the Treasurer, Mr. Morgan Cow, spoke at Carnegie Hall and his opening remarks. When he opened the speech, he said, the second friend is no military secret. We all know that just over the horizon, we of the United Nations are piling up the thunderclouds of the greatest attack in history. now we are ready to deal a few blows ourselves. And there will be blows that I can promise that will rock Nazi Germany to its rotten, blood-stained foundation. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States Government, the Cabinet member of our government, opened the speech last night with a statement that we are ready and this second war-bound drive is raised in order to make possible the invasion of Europe, in order to make possible the joining of hands of our brave American boys, of the heroic boys of the British Army, with the heroic people and army of the Soviet Union, in one mighty invasion of Europe that will once and for all put an end to Hitlerism and his slavery. And it is these bonds that we made you to buy today that will give the answer of the firm workers to the American government, that we will give and give and give in every way possible to make possible the realization of the invasion of Europe to make possible victory over Hitlerism in 1943. Now, it is my job and present job to introduce to you the next and last speaker, one who has inspired and led our union with its 80,000 members all over the United States and Canada to make a record of war activities that is a shining example for the entire labor movement in this country, one who is the inspirer of 7,000 members of our union who are today in the armed forces and who inspires these 7,000 members to fight in the front ranks of the American armed forces and who will give an account of themselves in the same manner and even more ironically and even with greater sacrifice than the membership of our union that has stayed behind to support them on this side. It gives me pleasure to introduce to you the president of the International Foreign Workers Union, Ben Goh. Friends, since that we are bound to enter a new very important and perhaps decisive phase of this great tragedy of mankind. It seems that a great many developments will take place in the year of 1943. free. It seems that a great many battles will take place in the very near future. And every battle will bring closer the day when all of us and the entire civilized world will gather to celebrate the great moment of the collapse of the Nazi cannibals and the victory of the civilized world. Tables are definitely turning slowly but surely. Not long ago Hitler and his chiefs were bragging about the superiority of the German weapons. Today it is generally recognized that our country alone succeeded in outproducing the Nazis to the decree that even the Nazis recognized this fact. Both in quality and quantity our weapons are superior to the Nazis' murderous weapons. Not long ago the entire world was trembling with fear at the trap of Hitler that he is going to continue bombing London to a shambles. Today this situation is entirely different. Our liberators and fortresses and the spitfires and the Russian stormwakes are bombing Germany without a stop. And he feels the taste of his blitzkrieg methods. Not long ago Churchill in his speech stated to the British people that the only thing that he can offer them is sweat and tears and blood. Today Hitler and Gables and Gettys sing that song and they talk to the German people of blood and tears and sweat. Not long ago all of us were afraid that Hitler might carry out his threat to invade the British Irish. Today there is a great deal of talk about invasion but the invasion of the United Nations and the European continent that will catch Hitler and the most brutal milkcracker in the history of military matters. On the one side our boys and the British boys on the other side the glorious Red Army that will split the Nazi Army and annihilate it until the Casablanca decision of unconditional surrender will become a fact. Until recently Hitler kept on talking of speedy victory now in our ranks that fought in a speedy victory. We are done interested in that victory come as soon as possible. We can't afford to prevent this war too long. It is no war that great invincible Nazi cannibal army that threatened the entire world. Come in war. We are going to war. We are going to war. We will never fight again on the side of the Nazis. In order to carry through that great fight of mankind, we must make every effort to help our government, help the armed forces of the United Nations to make that possible. and we gather today publicly and officially to reassure our decision and make it clear that we are ready and willing and eager to back up that decision by action. Now we are opening the great campaign for 13 billion dollar bonds and the workers who hate fascism, who hate reaction, with these fights of pressure, who are always on the job to fight for democracy and freedom and the rights of labor and the well-being of our nation, are called today to make the opening. The International Union intends to develop an intensive campaign to contribute two million dollars to this fund to buy bonds. I ask, is there a motion to instruct the General Executive Board to develop the campaign among its members for two million dollars? In this month, is there a motion to that effect? Is there any seconder to the motion? regularly moved and seconded to instruct and empower the General Executive Board of the International Union to develop the campaign for two million dollars war bonds? All in favor, signify by raising your hand and keep it up. Keep it up. Keep it up. Let's have a picture so that we can see it whether there is a unanimous decision. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Beat Marks now. Okay, man. Done. Any opposed, raise your hand. hand. And this is the unanimous decision that we again serve no rest on the cannabis and the appeasers and the agents of Hitler that we are ready to fight to the last drop of blood to annihilate the Nazis for the victory of the civilized world. At this time, may I ask you to take your heads off? I introduce and with this unanimous decision of the fur industry to back the second war loan of the United States government, we bring to a close this program, of which has been taken part in the 29th Street, 7th Avenue corner, at which point the war emergency board of the fur industry has held its war bond rally. Among the speakers that were heard on today's program was his honor the mayor of the city of New York, Mayor Lagardia. Milton Burrell served as emcee for part of the program, Henry Engel, chairman of the War Bond Rally Committee of the fur industry, George I. Fox, chairman of the War Bond Committee, Lou White, chairman of the War Emergency Board of the fur industry, and Gene Merrill, that is, a Metropolitan Opera star, who sang the Star Spangled Banner and the Army Air Corps song. And also, we just heard from the president of the Furious Union, Ben Gold. Ladies and gentlemen, before we leave, remind you that once again, when you buy bonds, you are only lending your money while your own brothers, sons, and husbands are giving their lives. And so, on the theme of any bonds today, we conclude this program, which has been a public service feature of your city station. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System. For the one, the premier Amy
