We are interested because we know that this District Health Center service serves the health needs of more than 200,000 persons, of whom approximately 70,000 are New Yorkers of Puerto Rican origin. We know that the East Harlem District Health Center gives child health service, tuberculosis services, social hygiene services, health education, nutrition education, and many other services designed to protect and promote the health and well-being of the residents of East Harlem. Certainly I, as Governor of Puerto Rico, want to urge all of the New Yorkers of Puerto Rican origin who live in this District to take full advantage of the services of your Department of Health and that which it offers, and also to urge all of them to cooperate and work with the Department of Health in protecting and promoting the health of themselves and all New Yorkers. I know that the people of Puerto Rico join with me in recognizing the opening of this magnificent District Health Center as but one sign of the enduring friendship and understanding that exists between the people of New York and the people of our island. Cordially yours, Luis Minos Marin, Governor of Puerto Rico. Thirty-one years ago, a program was begun on this site which has grown and spread to every section of our city. In 1921, the East Harlem Health Center was opened here. It was the first of what has become the citywide system of health centers of the Department of Health. Those centers now bring the many services of our Department of Health directly to the people of the city in their own neighborhood. When it was opened, the East Harlem Health Center was described as a pioneer experiment in the development of local cooperation in matters of health involving citizens, voluntary health and welfare organizations, and the Department of Health. One of the purposes of that pioneer effort was to measure the value of such cooperation. The value of that program which began here has been tremendous and it is still growing. The value of that program is now. Since the first health center was opened 30 years ago, we have made tremendous strides in improving and in maintaining the health of the people of our city. Those strides have been made under the guidance and leadership of your Department of Health. The public imagination is caught and held by reports about new wonder drugs such as penicillin and the antibiotics. I would like you to realize that some of the achievements of your health department in the last 30 years have been as dramatic, as striking, as anything achieved by the discovery of any new wonder drug. Let me take just two examples, diphtheria and typhoid. In 1921, the year the East Harlem Health Center was opened, more than 15,000 New York City children were stricken by diphtheria. Almost 900 of them died. So far this year, there have been but 14 cases of diphtheria and exactly one death from that disease. Many of us here are old enough to remember when diphtheria was the most dreaded scourge of childhood, when every year thousands of children were stricken and hundreds died. Today, and this is largely due to the leadership and work of the Department of Health, diphtheria has been all but eradicated from our city. Now let us talk of typhoid fever. In 1921, 899 persons were hit by that disease. 123 of them died. So far this year, there have been only 82 cases and not a single typhoid death. This disease too has yielded to the constant vigilance and to the never-ceasing work of your Department of Health. I could go on citing achievement after achievement of your Health Department, but there are still big health problems which face our city and our people. Ours was one of the first cities to undertake a systematic fight against tuberculosis. Ours was one of the most difficult things. In the world, the most difficult fight against this disease has been reduced. And this fight, like those against diphtheria and typhoid, will ultimately be won. Our Department of Hospitals, as you know, has played an important part in the development and use of a new drug drug with which to fight tuberculosis. That helps to bring nearer the day of complete victory over the white plague. When our doctors and scientists eradicate the epidemic diseases, new problems arise. Those problems mainly concern the diseases and afflictions of middle age and later life. These diseases are the same. Such diseases as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Here in this new health center, in addition to all the regular services of the department, there will be a center detection, a cancer detection prevention center. The cancer detection prevention center here will be one of a chain of such centers throughout the city, where all knowledge and skills we have for fighting this disease will be put at the service of the people. This is a magnificent structure designed to be used to meet the new needs of this community of East Harlem. But to me, the heart of the service here lies in the people who work in this building. The doctors and nurses, the sanitarians and laboratory technicians, and all the others with special skills and high devotion to their tasks. For we must always remember that wicked and evil men, as well as good and devoted men, can build great buildings. It is not the building that matters alone, but the use to which it is put. This building is but a place in which people can work at the high task of saving and guarding life, at the great work of building health. In formally opening this new and remodeled East Harlem District Health Center, we dedicate an institution of service, an institution which will serve our people and our way of life. The part of any one of us that we may play might be very small, but the total purpose and the total effect is great. It is your building to be used by you and your servants of the health department to serve great purposes. And in conclusion, I want to take this opportunity of extending the appreciation of Mayor Impeletary and the 8 million people of the City of New York, and the congratulations and felicitations to Commissioner Mahoney, to Commissioner Zermuelen, and to all who have participated in the bringing about of this wonderful contribution to the improvement of the health conditions of East Harlem. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Mayor. The next speaker will address in Spanish, Reverend Father James McSherry of St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church. Father McSherry. Administrative members distinguished guests and friends of Harlem. I don't think it's necessary to say that we are interested in you. I say we are, that is, the parents, the religious, the monks. Entra in one of our schools, be it the school of San Pablo, or the Santa Rosario, or the Nuestra Señora de Monte Carmel, or the Santa Cecilia, or the all the saints, and see the monks teaching and trying to make their children good citizens. For them, they are very interested. And we also. We are interested in your soul. Your soul is worth a lot in the eyes of God. We want you to appreciate your soul. I hope it is so. But at the same time that we are interested in your soul, we are interested in your body. That your body is strong, vigorously, healthy. And why do we not have to be interested in your body? Our Lord was interested in your body. Lea the Gospel. And see how he traveled through the streets of Galilee, giving the sight of the blind, hearing the deaf, hearing the deaf, hearing the deaf, hearing the deaf, hearing the deaf, hearing the deaf. He was interested in our lives. He was interested in our lives. And also, we are interested in our lives. And that's why we are very happy. In this occasion, when we open this office of health. It is a blessing to this city. Here will come the mother with her child. And the doctor and the nurse will examine the body. Inoculant against the microbial. And administrating the medicine. In a word, protecting the health of this vecindad. That's why we are very happy. Thank you. Brexit. Thank you, gentlemen. We are so called. Thank you.

Commissioner Mahoney, it is my great privilege and pleasure to now present to you the key which will open the doors to this great health center, which I know will bring a great deal of alleviation of the troubles and pains of suffering of the people of East Harlem and bring to them education in the field of good health. Thank you very much, sir. I shall take a good deal of pleasure in turning this key to Dr. Ayers, who is and will continue, we hope, for a long time to serve as the district health officer for East Harlem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And that, gentlemen, concludes the ceremony. You are all now welcome to inspect the building if you care. And I'd like to thank very much the sanitation van for their courtesy. Thank you.
