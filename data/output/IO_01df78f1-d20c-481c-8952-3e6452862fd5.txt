When you walk by a war bond, remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the boys overseas are giving their lives. You are only asked to lend your money. And on this theme, your city station microphones are set up at 29th Street and 7th Avenue on the southwest corner to bring you the ceremonies of the war bond rally of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry. Among the notable speakers to be heard will include our own mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Fiorello H. Ligardia. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Henry H. Engel, who is chairman of this rally. Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a privilege to present a great singing star who has graciously consented to be with us at this monster war bond rally. She has sung with the Metropolitan Opera Company, the San Francisco Opera Company, and is now one of the stars of that smash hit operetta, Rosalinda. It gives me great pleasure to present Miss Jean Merrill, who will sing our national anthem. DR. T bet she's not sooms of the awards, she stars her cut in her name. He's enjoyed the Як- maps of the euro ş different,igneur, and wrote their second-year name. And in tower kabrigan- melhor that�pmход, can you see you see he and the lardy guy in the Bedford room? 해서 $190 Inc advertisers? A lardy guys that's got business! Seraft in the gosh-pop rots, a roman s and his year-year name. That'săm bir kỗiop rots up by burning km ń' Echonymz commune. The world's eyes draws through their walls wide. The moon we watched as the planet is turning. On the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air. Gave proof through the night that our faith was still there. Oh, save us, our God's companion, and we live in vain. And the love of the brave. Thank you, Ms. Merrill. And now, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of this rally, I wish to present the chairman of the War Bond Committee of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry, Mr. George I. Fox. Ladies and gentlemen of the Fur Industry, I welcome you as chairman of the Bond Committee of the Fur Industry to this rally, which marks the opening of the greatest drive of the nation. The nation has attempted to raise a huge sum of $13 billion for the support of our boys in the field. The fur trade has pledged itself to participate to the extent of $10 million in bond stores this drive. I'm sure that every one of us, both employers and employees alike, will do their share in participating in this privilege, to share in the fight for freedom, democracy, and until victory is ours. I know the fur trade, then, will all to a man, will come along and not wait to be approached and coached to participate in this privilege. You will come along from your own free will, and buy buns as much as you can, so that we can share in the effort until the Nazis and the fascists have been wiped off the earth. We have a very elaborate program prepared for you. We have some nationally known singers and some well-known speakers, among whom our very beloved Mayor, the Honorable Fiorello Lagaria will speak to you in a little while. And now I'm going to introduce to you the young man who will take over to this master of ceremonies on this occasion, a man who is a nationally known artist, both on stage and screen, who has just come back from the coast, where he has entertained 195 camps. He is also appearing on the Campbell's program each Wednesday night. He is the star of the Siegfeld Follies. He's a man who gives of himself at all times that he's ever called upon to perform a duty for patriotic services and for very charitable causes. I give you the very fast-approaching number one comedian of the United States, our very beloved Milton Berle. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Fox, it's a wonderful announcement for a skin dealer. I'm very glad to be here today, ladies and gentlemen, on this wonderful rally. It's very nice and warm out here. I should have worn my son-of-fuck earmuffs today. But I want to tell you... Pardon me, I just got up. It's a pleasure and a privilege, really. On behalf of the fur industry, and I'd like to be half of the fur industry, it's really a thrill to be up here on this rostrum with all these. I guess all you ladies and gentlemen in this very vast audience are wondering who these very, very gorgeous-looking ladies are here with the roses in their hands. May I say that these ladies, I'd like to introduce them, have them stand up and take a bow. They're all mothers of all the boys from the fur industry that are seeing service. Let's give them a swell hand. Here they are. Thank you very much, ladies. Thank you. You look very, very pretty. Very. I want to tell you that everybody's going to be here. The mayor, Mayor LaGuardia, was supposed to be here a little earlier, but he's tied up. He's playing bingo up in 48th Street, you see. If he's here, I'm kidding, Fiorello. But I have... Everybody, in fact, you know, the reason I'm here for another reason, I'm very, very glad because I have a brother. Mr. Fox, you can sit down. We saw your coat. Looks all right. Looks... Gets up and shows his coat. And who's afraid of the big, bad wolf? I.J. Fox. I am... No, pardon me. I mean George Fox. But it is really... My brother's in the fur industry. He's a caracal curler. Got a wonderful job. You know how you can curl caracal. They're curled already. Do I have to explain the jokes here today? But I want to tell you, it's really very, very... A big thrill, ladies and gentlemen, really, to be up in this pond around. There is very... In fact, Eleanor Roosevelt was supposed to be here, but it was too near. And... I'm a little tired out. I've been ironing all day and forging my ration card. And I want to tell you, it... This is like trying to get laughs in a murder trial. Will you relax? Laugh when the world laughs with you. Try and they put you on a goodwill. I want to tell you... It's very, very difficult trying to get laughs when there's subway going underneath you here. But I want to tell you that I would like to introduce... I would like. I would like to go back to sleep. I would like to introduce... I'm really... I'm tired, really. I'm very happy, though, today. It's my anniversary. I've been married a year today. I don't know what to get my wife. She wants a man. I, um... Oh, now you laugh. I like that our New York finest, all these very fine policemen, are doing a wonderful job here this afternoon. I want, I think, a swell hand for the New York's finest, boys. Let's give... Let's give all the boys a hand. Except the guy up on 34th Street wouldn't let me through. And if he can hear me, I mean it. He's a... He's a Harvard man. And, um... No, all kidding aside, all these fellas... I played a cop in my last picture. I made a picture called Margin for Error. Who saw the picture? Anybody see it? Three, four, five. Thank you. You did. Hello, Ben. I'm glad to see you. Ben Platt's here. I guess he wants me to mention his name. I mentioned it. Now you go back to your store. All right. I played a cop in that picture, and I had the most important part in that picture in Margin for Error. Joan Bennett, she's in the picture, too, and I have the most important part. At the beginning of the picture, I open the door and let Joan Bennett in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. That's the end of the joke. What do you want? Gasoline? Relax. May I present... May I present as our first surprise, ladies and gentlemen, may I present... as our first surprise, some kids from CCNY waving to me over there. How are you, kid? Fine. How are you? Playing hooky, huh? May I present four boys, ladies and gentlemen, that are from our very fine United States Coast Guard. All of them have seen action and fighting. One gentleman who was the head of the Southerners, Mr. Homer Smith. You've heard on the Columbia Broadcasting System, and he's gathered all these boys and formed the Coast Guard Quartet, which is one of the finest singing quartets in the service. Now, the fellow members of the quartet are Miss James Lewis, Thomas Lockhart, Martin Bowen, with Frank Boyle at the piano. Now, Homer, suppose you take over and tell him what we're going to do. Where's Homer? All right, Homer. Our ladies and gentlemen, Homer Smith. A swell hand for Homer Smith. Thank you. Oh, yeah, I know you, Homer. How's everything? All right?

lady has been doing such a wonderful job in all the camps and navy bases and everything and her very swell and grand husband who is in the navy right now in the marines I'm sorry pardon me well

Tyrone Powell ladies and gentlemen I'm awfully sorry thank you I'm sorry I'm sorry oh darling ladies and gentlemen I have to make a confession first as you'll be able to realize very soon I'm awfully bad to make speeches so this morning they gave me that to read to you and on the way over in the car I tried and I found out that I was as bad to read it than just to try to make it by myself so if you don't mind I'll try in my own words to tell you what I feel and if my accent is not very good and if I don't always use the right word I want you to know that at least it comes from the bottom of my heart I'm an American citizen now and I'm very proud of it I'm married to an American citizen you know who he is and I'm very proud of it too but I was born in France in Paris and coming from Europe as I suppose many of you did and you have some of your family and some of your parents over there you know all how much they are waiting for the American soldiers to arrive so what we are going to try to do today and every day is to try to hurry that day of freedom for all those poor countries over there and for that we need more guns and more tanks and more planes and for that we need every penny we can give because a little while ago 15 or 16 months ago we were asked to buy defence bonds and that was wonderful we had to defend ourselves and we wanted to fight and we were hoping to win but today what you are asked for is even more exciting because today we know we are going to win but we want to win quickly and if you can remember that maybe each time you are going to give a dollar each time you are going to buy a bond it's going to bring peace nearer to us maybe it's going to save an hour or one minute so if you think of that when you are going to give the dollar don't wait an hour don't wait a minute don't wait a second but please please do it now thank you thank you thank you Annabella thank you lots of good luck tomorrow gots to tie after all what has Tyrone Powell got that I haven't got I'm sorry to say but ladies and gentlemen it is my pleasure now to present to you at this time a gentleman who is the chairman of the war emergency board of the fur industry who discusses the records of the war emergency board may I present to you the chairman Mr. Lou White here is Mr. Lou White ladies and gentlemen my friends have often told me that I look ten years younger with my hat on and I'm sure that I'll feel at least twenty degrees warmer if I keep my hat on pardon me Mr. White may I interrupt were you caught in the hair raid if I had the humor that our friend Mr. Burrell has here I could answer him but if you also had my hair it would be alright the war emergency board of the fur industry composed of labor and management organizations in the industry has done an outstanding job in its war effort activities it has sponsored the previous war bond drive salvage drive blood donors drive and through its war chest recently distributed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to war relief agencies of the allied nations the board's greatest gesture was the creation of the fur vest project which is now of national scope and operation thousands of fur line vests have been distributed to brave merchant seamen of the allied merchant marine and this project is to be continued indefinitely to ensure a steady flow of these vests for the duration of the war this project was made possible through the patriotism and generosity of the fur workers many of you within the hearing of my voice are giving unstintingly of your time and labor for this most worthy cause and I'm sure you'll continue to do so we are here today to ask you to make another contribution but one which will not require your time or even effort the United States government is asking you to put your money into the finest and safest investment in the world not only will you receive a good rate of interest and ensure yourself against poverty and distress in the years to come but these bonds will pay big dividends in victory freedom and the peaceful pursuit of happiness bring those boys over there back quicker by backing them up with your dollars over here and now it is my extreme pleasure to present to you a dynamic personality a real friend of the fur industry a man who has been untiring in his duty and devotion to his country and his city his honor the mayor of New York Fiorella LaGuardia Miss Charmin Benny who said this was a ghost town I wish some of these employers were trying to bring back starvation wages and the sweatshops and Macy's and Bloomingdale's and Abraham and Strauss could come here and see this ground and incidentally while we're fighting this war we are not going to permit labor standards to be brought down now let Bloomingdale and Macy and Abraham and Strauss and Lord and Taylor take note of that and perhaps look at their own payrolls and give their employees a better birth you know Ben Gold asked me to come here make an appeal for this second war loan and after he asked me to come here and make the appeal he just now told me you're oversubscribed already and of course I know that the fur industry will come through as they always do you know as I said last night at Carnegie Hall the matter is very simple we either loan the money to our government and get it back with interest or else Hitler and the Japs will come over here and take it away from us we get nothing and we're not going to let them come over here and that is why we want to make this second war loan not only successful we want to oversubscribe it and I am sure that the flourishing prospering great industrial town of New York will lead the whole procession now of course we have no illusions about this men it's going to be a long and difficult war there's no doubt as to the outcome but we must do a complete job that means that there is a great deal of hard and difficult fighting ahead the news this week is rather encouraging the French the British and our American troops are chasing Rummel and his army into the waters of the Bay of Tunis the army of the Soviet Republicans are pushing back every attempt of the Nazi forces to break through again the Russian army has now the Nazi army in the mud up to their knees and pretty soon they'll have them in the mud up to their necks it wasn't so many weeks ago when Hitler was making preparations for his march into Moscow and as I told you at the meeting Madison Square Garden the only time the Nazi army will see Moscow will be when they'll be taken there as prisoners of war and yet as I say there's a great deal more fighting to be done and we have to fight until we've beaten and crushed and destroyed the Japs Hitler and his little pal Mussolini too none of them are any good and never were any good and some of us knew that they were no good all of the time so I want to congratulate the fur industry of New York City employers and the organized workers of the fur industry in getting an early start in this war loan in setting the example to other industries and I know that you'll make good for your country this time as you always make good this war is not only for our protection it's for a better world to bring about the assurance of peace and economic security not only for our people but for the people of the entire world thank you thank you honor for bear LaGuardia it was really a wonderful wonderful speech I know the little flower so well I call him bud never forget the time I landed California on the plane and I landed at LaGuardia airport right on the brim of his hat but I do want to tell you incidentally I'm wearing an Adam's hat myself looks like Adam Warren but I do look he's rehearsing there again thank you may I now you'll get a chance really to play that music they've been rehearsing there for about 15 minutes may I introduce now once again the little lady that sang our national anthem at the beginning of the show and she's going to do a little song for herself and for you lovely ladies and gentlemen may I present to you the star the singing star Rosalinda Miss Jean Merrill let's give her a swell reception off we go into the fire blue yonder climbing

you mr mitchell of the treasury department ladies and gentlemen thank you mr pearl i'm not going to talk to you about bonds i know as the mayor said that you people will assume your obligation what i want to talk to you about is what you are going to think during this bond drive and it's been said far better than i could tell you a long time ago by thomas payne he wrote it at the time of the revolution when we at that time also had a crisis this is what he said these are the times that try men's souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men and women tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of the conflict the more glorious the triumph i call upon not a few but upon all not on this state or that state but upon every state and up and help us lay your shoulder to the wheel better to have too much force than too little when so much is at stake it matters not where you live or what rank of life you hold the evil or the blessing will reach you all the far and the near the home country and the back the rich and the poor will re-suffer and rejoice alike the heart that does not feel now is dead the blood of his children will curse his cowardice who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved

Thank you. You're really wonderful. And now I think it's time that I'm going to retire, ladies and gentlemen, as you master of ceremonies, and turn this program over to one whom you all know and I think and I believe and I'm sure you respect. He's a business manager at the Furrier's Joint Council. He is one of the most elegant voices of labor. He's been in a large measure responsible for the success of this rally. And his associates in the union have given their time and energy in the handling of arrangements. May I present to you, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Irving Potash. And thank you and good afternoon. Now, first of all, let's express en masse thanks to Mr. Milton Pearl for his generosity and his kindness to come here and be with us and introduce everybody. Give the hand now, everybody. Secondly, let me inform you that you stay on and if you get into the shop a half hour or more later, you will be permitted to work it off. So stay until the meeting is over. And thirdly, let's see whether we can take our hands out of our pockets, all of us here. This is not just a meeting for the speakers from the platform. This is a meeting where all of you will have to speak. Those of you on the sides, all over, take your hands out of your pockets and the rest of you to the right of me and those in the front. Let the gentlemen from the Treasury Department, let the United States government representatives know that you are here not only to listen to speeches, but you are here to demonstrate your readiness to support with money and with everything until we smash Hitlerism and wipe them off. The face of the earth, get your hands out and put them up and this pledge to the United States government representatives here. Let's see your hands. Take them out of your pockets. Let's see this pledge from everybody here at this audience. Come up with your hands. Take them out. They won't freeze. All over down the other side. Express your opinion and your determination. Next. You have on this platform for workers, women, mothers, members of our union, workers in this industry, who have given their sons in the United States armed forces, some of them two sons, some of them three, some of them their sons and daughters, some of them sitting on this platform, your sisters, working with you in your shops, members of your union, have had their sons over on the other side, who have already made their supreme sacrifice, who have already laid down their lives, so that you and I and the rest of us in this world may live free of the boot of Hitler. They are right here, the mothers, your sisters, and your fellow members of your union and your industry. You have here a mother of a hero. You have read the newspapers only the other day of a member of our union, a young worker by the name of Abrams, who was a lieutenant in one of the bombers' fortresses that sunk three German ships in the Atlantic. That hero's mother is right here on this platform. These mothers have given their sons and the United States Treasury Department is calling upon us to give money to buy bonds so that the United States government may be able to buy the best that the American people and the American workers can produce, the best ships, the best trains, the best tanks and guns to their sons and the sons of millions more to put an end to Hitlerism, to put an end to slavery, to bring about the world free of the threats, free of the slavery imposed by Hitler and the conquered people, to bring about a better and freer world for all of us. These are the mothers here who have sent their sons for that purpose. Last night, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Morgan Powell, spoke at Carnegie Hall and is opening remarks. When he opened the speech, he said, the second friend is no military secret. We all know that just over the horizon, we of the United Nations are piling up the thunderclouds of the greatest attack in history. Now we are ready to deal a few blows ourselves. And there will be blows that I can promise that will rock Nazi Germany to its rotten, blood-stained foundation. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States government, the Cabinet member of our government, opened the speech last night with a statement that we are ready and this second war-bound drive is raised in order to make possible the invasion of Europe, in order to make possible the joining of hands of our brave American boys, of the heroic boys of the British Army, with the heroic people and army of the Soviet Union, in one mighty invasion of Europe that will once and for all put an end to Hitlerism and his slavery. And it is these bonds that we made you to buy today that will give the answer of the fur workers to the American government that we will give and give and give in every way possible to make possible the realization of the invasion of Europe to make possible victory over Hitlerism in 1943. Now, it is my job and present job to introduce to you the next and last speaker, one who has inspired and led our union with its 80,000 members all over the United States and Canada to make a record of war activities that is a shining example for the entire labor movement in this country, one who is the inspirer of 7,000 members of our union who are today in the armed forces and who inspires these 7,000 members to fight in the front ranks of the American armed forces and who will give an account of themselves in the same manner and even more eroically and even with greater sacrifice than the membership of our union that has stayed behind to support them on this side. It gives me pleasure to introduce to you the president of the International Foreign Leather Workers Union, Ben Gove. Friends, since that we are bound to enter a new very important and perhaps decisive phase of this great tragedy of mankind, it seems that a great many developments will take place in the year of 1943. It seems that a great many battles will take place in the very near future and every battle will bring closer the day when all of us and the entire civilized world will gather to celebrate the great moment of the collapse of the Nazi cannibals and the victory of the civilized world. Tables are definitely turning slowly but surely. Not long ago, Hitler and his chiefs were bragging about the superiority of the German weapons. Today, it is generally recognized that our country alone succeeded in outproducing the Nazis to the decree that even the Nazis recognized this fact. Both in quality and quantity, our weapons are superior to the Nazis' murderous weapons, and the Nazis' not long ago, the entire world was trembling with fear at the threat of Hitler that he is going to continue bombing London to a shambles. Today, this situation is entirely different. our liberators and fortresses and the Spitfires and the Russian stormwakes are bombing Germany without a stop. And he feels the taste of his blitzkrieg methods. not long ago, not long ago, Churchill, in his speech stated to the British people that the only thing that he can offer them is sweat and tears and blood. today, Hitler and Gables and Gairdings sing that song and they talk to the German people of blood and tears and sweat. Not long ago, all of us were afraid that Hitler might carry out his threat to invade the British arms. Today, there is a great deal of talk about invasion, about the invasion of the United Nations and the European continent that will catch Hitler and the most brutal milkcracker in the history of military matters. On the one side, our boys and our British boys. On the other side, the glorious Red Army that will split the Nazi Army and annihilate it until the Casablanca decision of unconditional surrender will become a fact. Until recently, Hitler kept on talking of speedy victory. Now, in our ranks, that fought in a speedy victory. We are done. Interested in that victory? Come as soon as possible. We can't afford to prevent this war too long. It is no more that great, invincible, Nazi, cannibal army that threatened the entire world. The Minas de la Beric and the Soviet-Russian battle fields will never fight again on the side of the Nazis. In order to carry through that great fight of mankind, we must make every effort to help our government help the armed forces of the United Nations to make that possible.
