We say that right in the middle of our explanation why the radio came in and we're down here at Idlewild, New York's international airport, where a great company is assembled to combine Richmond, Brooklyn, Army and Youth Day. Just a few moments ago, a young Master DeVito took off in a helicopter and was carried over to a Scandinavian plane that will take him on a goodwill trip to Europe. And the poise of this youngster, he didn't seem to be much more than 10 or 12 years old. He was speeded on his way by Borough President Hall of Richmond. And just as the helicopter left with the youth on his way to carry the message of youth to Europe, why the other helicopter of the Navy, the Sikorsky, has just landed and Borough President Cashmore is standing at attention, receiving the salute of guns as they are taking off here with all the formalities of a great day at Idlewild. Borough President Hall has gone down to greet him and these two great boroughs of Richmond and Kings, to be more exact, but more affectionately Brooklyn, are holding forth here today in the formalities. Now there's still a few moments, the guns are still going and the President can't move while the prodigal prevails. But as soon as it's concluded, why he and Borough President Hall will come back to the speaker's stand. We'll have music by the department of, the police department rather, band and glee club. And when the time comes for the anthem, with distinguished artist singing as well, Marjorie Fabregas, and then the regular order of program, the formalities of these two Brooklyn, these two boroughs rather, we're not entirely all Brooklyn, just part. And the Borough of Kings, more affectionately as I said Brooklyn, will take over. And the guns are still going off and the Borough President has to stand there until all the prodigal formalities are finished. We're having a lot of fun here at Idlewild. We're demonstrating the facility of aviation with the calmness and ease with which this Sikorsky, Navy Sikorsky, dropped here on the ground right in front of the speaker's stand on a space that is not much bigger than the ordinary extension roof of a private dwelling. We conducted that fine exhibition of communications and their facilities from the Herald Tribune plane a little previous to that. And the air factors of the show here today have been very interesting. And if that gun ever stops firing, we'll have some other kind of a program as well. And now, Groveray Whalen has conducted his guests here to the stand, and it'll only be a few moments now while felicitations and greetings are going on here at the speaker's stand before we present Mr. Whalen. This wonderful air show here today at Idlewild and every day this week, despite prevailing ceilings, why, they've put on wonderful demonstrations. Those jet planes, despite low ceilings, they've done some very remarkable flying, breathtaking flying, in fact. And then we've had all the dramatization of Coast Guard rescue work with the various types of helicopters. In fact, every way that aviation may be adapted to the present-day situation, why we've had that demonstration. Our host, Mr. Whalen, is very anxious that the police department make arrangements for the public to come in and occupy the seats here in the boxes and reserve sections here. He wants everybody to sit down and take a seat, and he knows that the police department, in their own smiling, efficient way, will manage this and permit the people to occupy these seats here. Mr. Whalen requests that his guests be seated so that they may enjoy this program here today. What do you want, Eddie? Yeah. Well, just to show you that the police department is always alerted, Eddie Dillinger now tells me that they're ready to give us some music before we start the regular formalities because all the neighbors from Brooklyn and Richmond are shaking hands and saying hello. So we'll listen now to the police glee club while they consistently sing Jubilee. Thank you.

we folks But arrived in a helicopter He had read Of the assimilated rescue That we had the other day That unfortunately had an accident And he was hoping For a similar experience I'm sure I hope you also heard I think it was the 86 guns That saluted the president Upon his arrival He told me that if he had A Brooklyn policeman here He would have ordered the arrest Of the gunner Because he had not

drive by car But only a few minutes ago I think I proved this Brooklyn and Idlewild Are really next door neighbors They are no more than a few minutes flying time apart That's how close they'll be in the near future When flying becomes as commonplace as riding In our subways or taking a trip by automobile Our program this afternoon Is really a four in one ceremony Last Tuesday was supposed to be
