The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay In a duty out in the battle I must use as long asstone It breaks my heart to go. Something tells me I am needed at the front to fight the foe. He was soldier boy on marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, fall in, it won't be long. We're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, to the air. Hanson snakes makes the heart grow thunder. Ooh. Hanson snakes makes the heart grow thunder. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. To the nights I've hunder Wandering, darling, is your true? Distance only lands and shams then Though the ocean waves divide Absence makes the heart grow thunder Longing to be near your side Be near your side She was happy till she met you And the fault is all your own If she wishes to forget you You will please leave her alone She has come to her old mother Just because there is no other She'll be happy in her own sweet home When the harvest days are over Yes, we do Christ, we do And the sun gets flowers No, we die so free We die so free You will see the word you said That's the time we do shall wear When the harvest days are over Just be near My just be near For their days are over The two days are beyond Yes, we matter That's the time we take The time we hold We dial Dark time Me No. It is It is The band played on. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded. The poor girl would shake me alone. He's there is a girl with a small-earing friend. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. For an old man's gold She's a bird in a gilded A little brunca A shady green spot So happier home I find My heart's barely gone I love only one She's the girl I have to be mine Just what's her Only just what's her Where all of us I know That there must be her But always she is just the place I'll be happy forever With just one day I'll be happy for the future Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Thank you.

There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her, boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I see. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. We are 환quoid living, praying in other churches. We are 시간 now live. We are z slaves. We are not Israeli. There I be kind When nature's reddish, my darling Oh, comrade, what's there by my side? There's a name that's never spoken And a moment that's half broken There is just another thing From the old home that belongs There is still a memory living There's a father on the living And a picture that is true From the old home She's my sweetheart I'm her beau She's my honey My barco Good real valley Never before The river of the river The river of the river Is my sweetheart One evening in the month of May I met old Satan on the way I looked old Satan in the eye From the end of the river If you want to get to heaven When you die Get to heaven If you want to get to heaven, then go away. If you want to get to heaven, then go away. Don't think that the I am needed, that the front to fight the war. Lay the white in your heart, that the land no longer paid. On the right is the beautiful party, who might not be great. The beautiful party, who might not be great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
