Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. New Yorkers have come to City Hall Park this evening to watch one of the town's Christmas time traditions, the lighting of the city Christmas trees. During this program, taking place on the steps of City Hall, you'll hear Mayor F.H. Lagardia's annual Christmas message to his fellow citizens. And after the mayor's address, his son Eric is scheduled to press the switch that will light the 22 Christmas trees in the parks in all the five boroughs, including the 40-foot tree in front of City Hall. And now we take you to the front of the City Hall steps where we hear a musical program by the New York City Police Department, Glee Club. A Baycenter's release page's theme van denhaven The Wallhead, as I understand, is the bravest king in all the land. When most be decked with the gate alone, and also be repound before. How full average they balance, greaté and solid니bill. The Lord hath provided this In honor of the King of Lies Which on this day it will be served in His very mercy on the earth The Lord hath made their own Friends, fathers, love me all Now ladies and gentlemen we hear from Mr. William R. H. Latham, park engineer of the Department of Parks who is representing Commissioner Moses. Annually the Park Department takes pleasure in giving the city 22 Christmas trees in different parks throughout the city. In each of the five boroughs there is a ceremony such as this going on right now. In each of the other four boroughs the borough president is the principal speaker of the ceremony. Here in Manhattan we have two principal speakers. The first I take pleasure in introducing Borough President Stanley Isaacs. Mr. Latham, fellow citizens, I am proud of the chance to participate in this dignified ceremony Dedicating the Christmas tree in City Hall Park which will stand here as an emblem of beauty and of peace and goodwill. There are some who seem to think that we should not cut down our trees for these purposes. And they are so wrong. Our trees grow in the forests and they are used for many purposes. Some were cut down to form the lofty masts of ships in the older days. Some are cut down to furnish timber for our houses. Some have the most humble purpose of being turned into pulp that makes paper to carry the spoken and the written word. But what loftier purpose can be served by this beautiful tree that stands here than to stand forth in City Hall Park as the emblem of our real civilization, as that emblem of peace and goodwill that we need to show to the peoples of this city that we are a peaceful nation, that our citizens from all lands are here living peacefully together, and that we breathe to the people of all the world peace and goodwill. Thank you, Mr. Isaacs. I now take pleasure in presenting the mayor who will give his Christmas message to the people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The mission of the Son of God on earth, a mission of brotherly love, of justice, of happiness, and of peace among all people. We are fortunate in this country that we have been better able during the last few years to give meaning to this lesson. We have been fortunate in being able to enjoy the blessing of peace. But we cannot be fully and completely happy if there are others in the world who are suffering because of war. We want to share the happiness of peace with all the people of the world. And let our Christmas prayers be dedicated to him in the highest for world peace. To the people of the city of New York, may you enjoy your Christmas holidays. May that enjoyment be in the midst of your own families. And let us announce to the entire world that we shall glorify him in the highest and pray for peace toward men of goodwill. A Merry Christmas to you all. I think we can all add amen to that. The tree will now be lighted by Gene Lugardia, who will throw the large switch. Ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to the ceremony of the lighting of the Christmas trees being held on City Hall steps. They're just throwing the switch, which is in the center of a huge Christmas wreath in front of the steps. The mayor just finished speaking, and just then, the lights in this 40-foot tree with a beautiful star on top of it, overlooking the City Hall Park, were just lighted. At the same time, there are 22 trees in all, covering the five boroughs of the city, all lit up at once as that switch was pressed. In Borough Hall in Brooklyn, Joyce Kilmer Park, Bronx, Kings, and the Borough Hall in Richmond Park. The mayor just posed in front of the wreath and in front of the switch with his little daughter after the pressing of the switch. And now I believe we're to listen to the Sacred Heart Boys Choir. The Lord, Father, amid the snows, upon the winter night, will form the child of Christmas rose, the king of love and light. The angels sing the shuffle of time, the present of every child. And that his blessed blood first saw their exultation by. The characters become the 59-minute life. O come, Lamb of the Lord, cross the Lord. O give the heart with rapture gloves to greet the holy night that gave the world its Christmas rose, its King of love and life. O give us a claim, his name, the price of God was born. O paradise, O I, he came, that we will turn my joy. O come, let us adore him. O come, let us adore him. O come, let us adore him. Cross the Lord. O come, let us adore him. O come, let us adore him. O come, let us adore him. Cross the Lord. O come, let us adore him. Let us adore him. Cross the Lord. Cross the Lord. Cross the Lord. Cross the Lord. Cross the Lord. The field where they lay, O'er keep things and sheep, On a cool winter's night, With so, so near. Lo-well, lo-well, Lo-well, lo-well, Who is the King of Israel? Lo-well, lo-well, Lo-well, lo-well, Who is the King of Israel? League Club will now present O Holy Night. Go, go, go, go. Huh? Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining. It is the night of the dear Savior's birth. Long lay the world in sin and error pining. Till he appeared and the soul felt his words. A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices. For young the praise, a new and glorious Lord. Oh, Lord, your knees. Oh, hear the angels' voices. Oh, life divine. Oh, life when Christ was born. Oh, life divine. Oh, life divine. Oh, life divine. Oh, life divine. Oh, life divine. Oh, life divine. Blurred by the light, the face redly beaming, with glowing hearts by his cradle we stand. So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming, here came the wise men from the Aryan land. The King of kings, play thus in lowly manger, in all our trials born to be our friend. Fly of heat, O hear the angels' voices, O night divine. O night, O night, when Christ was born, O night divine. O night, O night divine. Ladies and gentlemen, from City Hall Park in Manhattan, we have brought you the ceremonies on the occasion of the lighting of the city's Christmas trees. During this broadcast, Mayor F.H. Ligotti delivered his annual Christmas message to the people of New York. Other speakers included Mr. William H. Latham, a park engineer representing Commissioner Moses, and the Honorable Stanley M. Isaacs, the president of the borough of Manhattan. Also heard the boys' choir and the police department glee club. And just at this moment, ladies and gentlemen, from the 40-foot tree across the park, there appeared a vision. It's Santa Claus. And the park department band at the foot of the Christmas tree playing Jingle Bells, we return you now to our studios in the municipal building. Thank you.
