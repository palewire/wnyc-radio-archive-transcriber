On the banks of Allen Water, And the Lord, a dreaded stone, There has come them all, On the miller's door, And the Lord, she's blinded by the gold door, For the sun, a freak, and a soldier, a soldier, a soldier, a soldier, On the banks of Allen Water, And the father and she. On the banks of Allen Water, And the winter snow fell past, There was no more seas, On the miller's door, And the northern shore, And the sky, and the northern shore, And the north shore, And the hills of the old land, And the mountains of the old land, And the north shore, And the north shore, And the north shore, On the band of Fast and Furious A leonsey We'll have great day Now it's the month of May, it's when Mary lies aflame Ho la la la la la la, ho la la la la la Now it's the month of May, it's when Mary lies aflame Ho la la la la la la, ho la la la la He's with his body there, a-dancing on the ground Ho la la la la la, ho la la la la la He's with his body there, a-dancing on the ground Ho la la la la la la, ho la la la la la We get old flagrant, a flatter with your stand Ho la la la la la, ho la la la We get old flagrant, a flatter with your stand Ho la la la la, ho la la la And through the bird's before the gyms spread out their brow The界 instrumental And through the bird's before the dives spread out their brow And through the bird's before the dives spread out their brow We live with you.

A spiritual is just sung by the choristers. And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabelle de Bore, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. The Chainsaw of the Welfare Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their feet up and feet, found a lock on the door. Great somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? I've got no lock on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to speak. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no sign, I've got no sign, I've got no sign. Do you complainin'? I've got my gals, I've got my gals, I've got no sign. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. From the sun, from the moon, from the people's sea. The folks with plenty of money, got to pray all the day. Keeps with plenty, you're not the worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am the friends of hell, get in time to ride. Never want me long and not well. Never want me to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm the boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, for heaven's all day long. What are you complaining? Got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my lord. I've got my gals, got my gals, for heaven's all day long. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Bet. The choristers are under the direction of Florence Marderosian, with Isabelle Labori as piano accompanist. The elimin Granoscope Youth Week Here You dem Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
