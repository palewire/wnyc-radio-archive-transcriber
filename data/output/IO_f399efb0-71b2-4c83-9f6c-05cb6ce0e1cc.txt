Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange Mayor Impoletari, it is my distinct honor and privilege today to present to you and through you, to the people of the city of New York, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of Genoa, Italy. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the mayor and the citizens of Genoa, on that occasion, made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has, on many occasions, proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. May the cause for which you have made our lives, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. May the cause for which you have made our lives, may the people of the city of New York. May the cause for which you have made our lives, may the people of the city of New York, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the city of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy, not only in Italy, but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the city's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the city of New York for your services for mankind. Thank you. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. And now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable syndicate in New York. It is theente band. My lord says people, these acts are emotional and astrophobia in واhts. It makes people feel of oppos Himself. But there are some particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Europe and is coming to my city, she did not have only completed a cordial visit to all of us. She also has a homage to the city of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is also come to Genova ambassador of democracy. She is so dear to the people of the United States, but so dear to the Italians, especially to the Genovese. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of democracy that lives in the United States, for which every citizen of American, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come to high levels of representative of the city. So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit is the name of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and its own, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is also the statement of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic democratic and has contributed to the United States and has been able to make it a great salute. This visit is the name of the United States and the great people of the United States, the great people of the United States, the great people of the United States, which we are deeply grateful for, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made up for us to be able to defend ourselves in the United States and to protect ourselves in the United States, which we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the world. And, well, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work, because the democratic democratic democratic freedom is really being established in the world and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For some time we are not understanding, we have been able to remember. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just in the moment when we were we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We were lost in the city of Città-Care, we were lost in the territory in which our work could be exploited, miseries and ravines, but the attack of this force, this democratic democratic democratic democratic was so alive that we had taken our work, our work andлен music usually stores. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in search of your land is an example to all the genoveses. An landfill! However, RIGHT! It doesn't matter if he then has not found the passage, it doesn't matter if each of us has not found the passage, if we have to persist, others will find the way, the way that everyone is free in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the Mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts indeed which have a significance in themselves and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which means so much to us and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps it didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
