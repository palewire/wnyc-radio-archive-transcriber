From New York's historic City Hall, your city station brings you a program marking the 239th anniversary of the birth of a great American. The man honored is Benjamin Franklin, and the exercises which include addresses here at City Hall and the laying of a wreath at Franklin's statue on Park Row are sponsored by more than a score of printing, educational, and civic organizations. But now to introduce the speakers, here is our chairman, the Honorable William H. Friedman, member of the New York City Tunnel Authority and chairman of the Graphic Arts Educational Commission. Mr. Friedman. Ladies and gentlemen, in behalf of 40 sponsoring organizations, the graphic arts industry extends a welcome to you here today. We have come here to celebrate the 239th anniversary of the birth of Benjamin Franklin, one of America's greatest sons. The story of his life has made a lasting impression throughout the world, and especially so in our own country where every man to a large extent may set his own goal and win it by the fruit of his own efforts. Benjamin Franklin achieved fame and greatness as printer, author, and publisher, scientist, philosopher, and statesman. History records few examples of a career with the interesting, versatile, and humane personality that was Franklin's. Few men who rose from such humble beginnings to such great and enduring splendor. It was Benjamin Franklin, the boy who walked the streets of Philadelphia to become munching on a loaf of bread. The youth who rose from printer's devil to become the new world's first great publisher. The man who invented stoves for his compatriot's warmth and designed lightning rods for their safety. The executive who gathered supplies for Braddock's march into the wilderness. The sage who signed himself poor Richard. The diplomat who raised a loan in France to gain his country's freedom. The patriot who shared in framing the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the treaties with France and Britain. These were only a part of Benjamin Franklin. Quite possibly, Benjamin Franklin was the greatest man the Western Hemisphere ever produced. Certainly, historians state that he stood head and shoulders above his contemporaries. That's why we, who are engaged in the graphic arts industry, are most anxious to perpetuate his teachings, and therefore we pause here today to pay our respects to this great man of revered memory, Benjamin Franklin, the printer. As part of the program, we have invited here representatives of various industries, business, and labor, each of whom will pay a tribute to Benjamin Franklin. First number on the program will be the singing of the national anthem by the audience and orchestra.

Benjamin Franklin was a leader always. We have such a man in our next speaker. As a printer, as the executive head of a large corporation, as a man who has published many books on the life of Benjamin Franklin, and as a businessman proud to be known as a printer, I have the honor to present to you Mr. Daniel C. McVicker, Vice President of the New York Employing Printers Association and President of the Brooklyn Eagle Press. Mr. McVicker will speak on Franklin in Business. In colonial times, even more so than today, only a well-to-do man could afford to serve his country abroad. But Benjamin Franklin Printer had no concern on this score, even though he started out penniless. So keen and shrewd were his business abilities and so dynamic the energies he directed into business channels that at the age of 49 he was able to retire from business with a continuing income estimated at a thousand pounds sterling, which was a pretty penny in those days. We should keep in mind that Franklin devoted only a part of his time to business. On the side, he found time for philosophical writing, for invention of the lightning rod, a stove, a copperplate printing press, and other useful things, for organizing a subscription library and a fire department, and for many other activities for the public good. The colonies had Franklin's business genius to thank for his freedom from concern over personal finances, which permitted him to serve so brilliantly his fellow colonials and later our country, which he helped to found. The study of Franklin's business career backs the belief that if he lived today, he would be world famous on the strength of his business abilities alone. Let's draw a few parallels from his career in relation to business activities today. Where do we find a more magnetic sales manager than the youngster who went with his printing partner to Burlington, New Jersey, to print paper money for the state of New Jersey? A committee of the legislature was charged with watching the operations, but from all accounts, they kept their eyes on the work, only the better to enjoy young Franklin's irresistible charm. Soon this artisan was doffing his apron to dine at their homes. He became intimately friendly with many officials of the province, and these friendships lasted through his lifetime. Where today is the business promotion man with a better sense of the dramatic touch than Franklin, who shoved his paper-loaded wheelbarrow through Philadelphia streets, not for want of ready money, but as he himself stated, to show his creditors how industrious and frugal he was. Undoubtedly, also, he was mindful of the advertising effect on local buyers of printing. Where the businessman today, more keenly aware of the opportunities in hand and more ready to take them than Franklin. He became his own debt-free master only four years after he set up in business. At the age of 28, he was public printer for Delaware and New Jersey, later of Maryland. Where the business ambition today, to better that of Franklin, who at an early stage in his career had dispatched partners to establish print shops in several of the colonies and in at least four towns in the remote West Indies. Where the modern merchant, more versatile than this colonial omnivendor, who under one roof sold soap, ballads, food, dry goods, books and stationery, and who on the side bought linen rags by the tons to sell to the paper mills. Where the newspaper publisher today, who could stimulate his circulation and increase his advertising revenue at will through the product of his own pen, as Franklin did, writing anonymously as the busybody. Poor Richard, whose almanac at a price to yield a generous profit, was an essential in every home in the colonies, and through the years since has enriched American literature, truly was a great businessman. His rare abilities in business are not so well known today only because he was even greater as a scientist, patriot, diplomat, government financier, statesman, and philosopher. It should be mentioned that there is no record of Franklin's deviation in the slightest degree from the finest ethics of business, the highest standards of fair dealing with his fellow men. He was a genius in business who simply couldn't help being successful, but who is best known to us today as what he most wanted to be, a staunch advocate of liberty and self-government as our first international citizen and first proponent of the good neighbor policy applied to all nations. Applause Benjamin Franklin, as a printer, was interested in labor. It was through labor and the printed word that his great philosophical writings have been spread across the face of the globe. Our next speaker, like Franklin, has been interested in labor, education, and philosophy and has devoted the larger part of a full and energetic life to the betterment of the social and economic conditions of the masses. There are few people who know the problem of vocational education as she does and it has been through her efforts that industry, labor, and education have gotten together at the round table to plan and develop ways and means for the proper training of young men and women for industry. The philosophy of labor, the philosophy of industry, and the philosophy of education as applied to vocational education are subjects close to her heart. It is therefore a privilege to present as the next speaker Mrs. Betty Hawley Donnelly, Executive Secretary of the Advisory Board of Vocational Education and Vice President of the New York State Federation of Labor. Mrs. Donnelly will speak on the subject, Franklin, on the job. Mr. Friedman, honored guests and future Benjamin Franklins, it is quite fitting that a representative of the great mass of organized workers throughout the state of New York, numbering over a million and a quarter in the American Federation of Labor, should pay tribute to a great man who was a working man. One of the proudest boasts of the Federation of Labor is the membership in our ranks of the skilled craftsmen in the printing trades. They have brought honor to the ranks of labor because they are skilled mechanics. I want to say just a word to you boys here today who are to be the future working people in the great army of the printing trades. I think that you are particularly blessed not only to live in this great land of opportunity, but especially blessed to live in the great city of New York that afford such marvelous educational opportunities. If vocational education has done one thing, it has brought to educators a fuller realization of the dignity of labor. And I say to you, future craftsmen, take advantage of that opportunity. If one lesson was taught us when our country was in this great danger, when we were facing almost catastrophe through the world and in America, it was the value of the working man. And we realize that the thing that keeps the lifeblood flowing in our war effort is the work of the mechanic on the job. Because the cry that went out from Washington was workers of America, man your factories, go to your ships, your country needs you. You say, what do we as printers do and what have we done as our contribution? Need I tell you how much the written and printed word has meant as in the daily press we review the happenings that's going on in that terrible war across the sea. And as we envision our boys, your companions, over there fighting the things and for the things in which Franklin and those of us who follow him believe, we realize the contribution that printing can make and has made. Because it will bring through the written word and the printed word the word of God and great men that will envision for us a world of peace in our tomorrow. So future craftsmen of America, follow in the steps of a great labor man. And I say the word labor man advisedly. And we pledge to you, the working people of this nation, that we will stand by with you, the future workers, in making possible a kind of a world that Franklin would envision. and that you will go forth as craftsmen, workers, and citizens. Thank you. Thank you. Many of you see quite frequently the Saturday Evening Post. I wonder whether when you see it there occurs to you the thought that it was Benjamin Franklin who was the original founder of the magazine which preceded the Saturday Evening Post. Benjamin Franklin's poor Richard Almanac is known wherever civilization exists. Benjamin Franklin's reputation as author would be great if only he had written nothing else than his autobiography. It is therefore a privilege to introduce to you as the next speaker Mr. Irving A. Chandler Trustee of the International Benjamin Franklin Society Alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania founded by Franklin. Mr. Chandler will speak on Franklin as author. Mr. Chairman ladies and gentlemen Benjamin Franklin with only two years of formal schooling became by self-education the ablest American writer of his time and while he was a master of plain terse and dynamic English he had no aspiration to achieve literary distinction. Franklin was not interested in writing fiction his thoughts and writings the more interested in the subject of facts and while he was a prolific writer he always had in mind and in view some present potent and practical utility. Franklin really began his writing at the youthful age of 15 years when as an employee of his brother's newspaper the New England Courant he surreptitiously wrote articles that appeared in that paper without the real author being known because he used the fictitious name of Silent Do Good. As we all know Franklin left his Boston home at the age of 17 to seek a career elsewhere and ended his seeking in the friendly city of Philadelphia where a few years later he established himself in the printing business this gave him the opportunity of creating and publishing in 1732 the first issue of Poor Richard's Almanac this almanac which Franklin published for 25 years with much profit to himself became intensely popular throughout the colonies because besides containing almanac material it copiously set forth writings that were both entertaining and displayed the fertile humor of Richard Saunders the fictitious name that Franklin adopted as the author and publisher of this annual publication it was in this almanac that Franklin first published his famous writing and article under the title of Father Abraham's Speech which was afterwards reprinted under the title of The Way to Wealth this has been described as the best sermon ever preached upon industry and frugality it received worldwide distribution it was copied in all the newspapers of European continent and distributed in Great Britain as a broadside ninety seventy editions of this wonderful speech were printed in English fifty fifty six in French eleven in German and nine in Italian it was translated into at least twelve other foreign languages including Chinese this is an American classic preeminent bear in mind that this was about two centuries ago Franklin's exploring and experimental activities in the then little known science of electricity achieved for him international distinction and membership in the eminent scientific societies in Europe such as the Royal Society of London and the Academy of Sciences in France way back in 1754 Franklin was the author of a plan for the union of the colonies that was thirty-three years before the drafting of our famous United States Constitution but in the minds of the people it was not yet time for such a union although probably needed and his plan for the union was regarded in England as being too democratic and in the colonial assemblies as giving too much authority to Great Britain Franklin's brain operated along scientific philosophical and political lines and the subjects that received the attention of his exploring and analytical mind during some period of his life aggregated more than sixty a number hardly any subject in human experience or as natural phenomena escaped his attention and became a basis of his writing even death was glorified in his writing on that subject Franklin was our first American economist the study of political economy attracted his attention and thoughts before the exploring minds of eminent men in Europe were attracted to its prominence his writings on economy were many and sound common sense Franklin was the only American ever to participate in the authorship and signing of four of our country's greatest historical and political documents first the Declaration of Independence second the Treaty of Amity and Commerce with France that secured the aid that vitalized the Declaration of Independence and made possible the winning of our war for freedom third the Treaty of Peace between Great Britain and the United States and last but greatest of all the United States Constitution a pioneer model of liberty and freedom everywhere not only as one of the greatest of our founding fathers but also through a half century of many kinds of public service Franklin demonstrated his unsurpassable skill as a constructive statesman of unimpeachable sincerity veracity and integrity he was a diplomat supreme ambassador extraordinary and the very personification of thirst and economy expressing gratitude for our countries having had the benefit of the life and skill of this unmatchable man I am impelled to say right now right now as never before in our country's history has our country more critically needed the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin the will of Benjamin Franklin which has become a classic the world over starts with the simple words I Benjamin Franklin printer so today what is more fitting than to have here the first president of the international association of printing house craftsmen a member of the board of governors of the New York club of printing house craftsmen manager of the color production department of the American weekly Mr. Perry R. Long who will speak on Franklin the printer Mr. Friedman ladies and gentlemen as a representative of the international association of printing house craftsmen I'm very glad to take part in this program today in honoring that great printer and great American Benjamin Franklin the top sergeants of the printing industry who comprise over 7,000 members affiliated with our local organizations in all the large cities of the United States and Canada and in fact all the people engaged in the printing industry regard Benjamin Franklin as our patron saint the many worthwhile things that Franklin did as a printer as a publisher and as a citizen as well as as a statesman has served as a pattern for inspiration for many people in past years for countless numbers of people in the years to come his life and deeds will continue to shine as an example to be emulated we honor Franklin at this time and we also honor the art of printing which he practiced for many years and which he was always so deeply interested our organization has instituted this year the observation of printing week and will continue every year along with the other printing crate organizations to observe printing week each year it will be observed in the week in January in which Benjamin Franklin's birthday anniversary occurs honoring the member of Benjamin Franklin and calling attention to his life and work will always be an important part of the observation of printing week Franklin after serving his apprenticeship in his brother's print shop in Boston traveled to Philadelphia where he secured work at his trade in the print shop of Samuel Kimer later he went to London and after working in two print shops there returned again to Philadelphia and was again employed by Samuel Kimer at the age of 23 Franklin set up his own print shop in Philadelphia a little later he started a newspaper called the Pennsylvania Gazette under Franklin's management this publication grew and prospered he saw the importance of advertising and built up the sale of more advertising in his paper than appeared in any other paper in the colonies at that time along with being a good printer Franklin became a prolific writer most of his writing had to do with the building up of the growing colonies and the welfare of the people in 1732 he observed that seven almanacs were printed and published at that time he believed that a better almanac could be published that'd be more helpful to the people not being afraid of competition he proceeded to write print and publish his own almanac which he named the poor richard almanac which was to become historically famous under the name of poor richard he wrote many sayings of philosophy and advice which the readers of the almanac liked very much the circulation grew rapidly sales reached as high as 10,000 copies annually the sayings of poor richard became very popular no american writer has ever been quoted as much as franklin's sayings of poor richard franklin printed a newspaper in german this was the first foreign language newspaper printed in the colonies franklin engraved the necessary plates and printed the first paper currency used in american colonies franklin drew and printed the first cartoon used in america franklin's pennsylvania gazette under different names and under many owners has been printed continuously since 1728 and today we know it as the saturday evening post franklin thought more said more and did more of enduring value than any other individual born under american skies we of the printing industry are proud of the work and accomplishments of benjamin franklin we are grateful for the great contribution he has made to printing which is recognized as the art preservative of all the arts as i look around the audience i see some very distinguished guests i want to call attention particularly to mr william wilson president of the printing pressman's union number 51 mr hill of the allied printing trades

new york school of printing class of january 1945 by william goulas president will each lay a wreath at the statue of benjamin franklin located in franklin square city hall new york city in humble reverence to this great statesman citizen and printer benjamin franklin's early life was one of travel and struggle and of trials and tribulations to obtain an education for himself and to become apprenticed as a printer in our great educational system in new york city over one and a quarter million students are being educated amongst these are approximately 50,000 young men and young women who are striving to carry out the same ambition that benjamin franklin had these 50,000 young young folks are attending the vocational and industrial high schools hoping to become apprenticed to industry and in that way become self-supporting self-respecting useful and worthwhile citizens these these people want and do get in new york city the best education for life and for a worthwhile living standing at the top of this field in education is an able and outstanding educator who is cooperating with industry labor and business and whose progressive leadership is making the vocational high schools of new york city the best in the world we had hoped to have dr john e wade superintendent of schools of new york city here in person but pressure of business has given us an opportunity to have in his place the very educator who is directly responsible for the success of vocational education in the city of new york it is therefore a great privilege that i have here now to present to you dr george j pickett jr associate superintendent of schools in charge of vocational education in new york city who will give us his own version of dr wade's speech on franklin and education mr chairman ladies and gentlemen honored guests and particularly the boys who are here from the new york school of printing superintendent wade has asked me to express his deep regret because of his inability to be here this morning but the pressure of his official duties has been such today as to make it absolutely impossible for him to leave the office therefore a lawyer distinguished chairman built me up as quite a person i think i'm entitled to that distinction largely because of my size the superintendent had he been here would have said this if benjamin franklin had done no more than to give to the world the rich wisdom in regard to self discipline incorporated in his autobiography he would today be considered an outstanding influence in the education of his fellow men but in addition to this admirable book a veritable guide for the human spirit he also edited and compiled poor richard's almanac a storehouse of maxims and proverbs which have become household sayings in many american homes it was through franklin furthermore that the first circulating library in america was organized a powerful medium ever since those early formative days for disseminating knowledge to a young and progressive republic the claims the claims of benjamin franklin for recognition as educator was based not only on these three milestones and a brilliant record of service he and thomas jefferson were probably the most versatile leaders among the founding fathers franklin achieved high distinction as we know as statesman scientist popularizer of science and finally as a member of the constitutional convention which framed the constitution of the united states this charter of our liberties is in accord with sound principles of democratic government and operates under a system of checks and balances that keeps our country from lapsing into a dictatorship let us appraise franklin's influence through his popular philosophical writings in a sense his precepts are the basis of an education for all of us today when there is so much uncertainty in the world so many conflicting opinions about everything including what constitutes an education we find some of our doubts resolved by franklin if we could for example prevail upon our young people to accept for themselves but for of the resolves that franklin made they would in this way reach a high stage of character development here are some significant points of view in regard to human nature as franklin sees it goodwill i resolved to speak ill of no man whatever not even in a matter of truth but rather by some means to excuse the faults i here charged upon others and upon proper occasion to speak all the good i know of everybody loyalty to endeavor to speak truth in every instance to give nobody expectations that are not likely to be answered but aim at sincerity in every word and action the most amiable excellence in a rational being perseverance to apply myself industriously to whatever business i take in hand and not to divert my mind from my business by any foolish project of growing suddenly rich for industry and patience are the surest means of plenty economy it is necessary for me to be extremely frugal for some time till i have paid what i owe there is character in the making there is the essence of a curriculum in ethics and morals there is franklin the educator and self educator franklin was an ardent believer in self education because he knew that education continues throughout life accordingly he was a champion of adult education not in a narrow sense but broadly as continuous training for all adults who would improve their minds and live more satisfying lives he did not hesitate to start learning another language at a time when most men are ready to retire to his way of thinking no one is ever too old to embark upon a new study from his earliest youth franklin was fond of reading and spent every cent he could lay his hands on for books his choice of reading material was essentially inspirational he read Plutarch's lives to great advantage Defoe's essay on projects and Dr. Mather's essay to do good other books he found valuable and recommends are Pilgrim's Progress Block and the Human Understanding Xenophon's Memorable Things of Socrates and the Art of Thinking by the Messias du Port-Royal these are some of the works he mentions in his autobiography as having influenced his thinking and his conduct in later life from his reading of Xenophon he learned a lesson that too few know one that may well be remembered by all of us when we engage in controversy the art of discussing without contradicting of persuading without opposing and of avoiding all violence in language and mental attitude how necessary it is to observe this caution if we wish to discuss important matters on an intellectual rather than on an emotional basis if we could but teach the restraints he had in mind we would make real progress toward drawing people closer together in universal brotherhood Franklin's reading and experience led him to the conclusion that truth sincerity and integrity in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life as a teacher of himself and as a guide for the teachers of others Franklin listed as virtues sincerity justice industry resolution moderation humility and said his intention was to habituate himself to practicing them one by one turning to the advice of Pythagoras and the golden verses Franklin agreed that daily self-examination is necessary to determine the extent to which a man had achieved his aims he made a little book in which he wrote each of the virtues on a page of its own and adopted the following excellent scheme for his own guidance in the morning what good shall I do this day in the evening what good have I done this day thus he molded his own character and by strict adherence to the code of behavior he had established for himself he foreshadowed a plan of life and growth that later became the typical American way there are no finer textbooks on how to live even in this day than Franklin's autobiography and his poor Richard's almanac his teachings for instructing others are eminently sound he advised if you wish to instruct others a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may occasion opposition and prevent a candid attention men must be taught as if you taught them not and things unknown proposed as things forgot to Franklin we owe the growth of the free public library and it was in his role as educator that he gave us this he had observed when he first established himself in Pennsylvania that there were few booksellers shops lovers of reading had to send to England for their books Franklin organized a group known as the Junto for the discussion of morals politics and natural philosophy members of this Junto each had a few books and Franklin suggested that they assemble these and lend them to each other this was done and the advantages were such that he proposed to extend them to the public a fund was set up and more books imported then the library was opened one day in the week for lending the books to subscribers on their promissory notes to pay double value if not duly retained the institution soon manifested its utility was imitated by other towns and in other provinces the libraries were augmented by donations reading became fashionable and our people having no public amusement to divert their attention from study became better acquainted and in a few years were observed by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same rank generally in other countries this collection of books later became the Philadelphia Library and was the predecessor of the modern public library Franklin and his father understood the desirability of exploring the likes and capabilities of students which is the purpose of the modern junior high school young Franklin wanted to go to sea his father dissented and determined that his son ought to make an intelligent choice of his trade accordingly he took young Benjamin upon an exploratory tour of the shops Franklin says he took me to walk with him and see the joiners bricklayers turners and others at their work that he might observe by inclination and endeavor to fix upon some trade or profession that would keep me on land it has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen and it has been often useful to me to have learned so much as to be able to do some trifling jobs in the house when a workman was not at hand and to construct little machines for my experiments at the moment when the intention of making them was warm in my mind the fundamentals of education Franklin knew these prescribed them showed us how to put them into practice the modern trend in educational practice to emphasize for all students the use of the hands and of tools as well as proficiency in basic academic subjects is in accordance with Franklin's teachings character development codes of behavior relationships between men and men are embodied in his maxim for his own guidance let me speak no ill of any man may I always speak all the good that I know about everybody Benjamin Franklin was a rare personality and a great leader as well not only was he a distinguished statesman publisher and public servant but he was also a great fighter leader for the rights of the common man we have here in our own city in our own generation a rare personality not only is he too a great leader a former publisher and I and a dynamic public servant but he too is the champion of the rights of the plain people he is a man whose record of achievement is unselfish and symbolizes the highest ideal of modern public service he is a man who has devoted all his life to the betterment of the social and economic conditions of labor and industry a man in whose life and achievements during peace and war we find a great parallel to the life and work of Benjamin Franklin he is the man who does what can't be done it is therefore ladies and gentlemen a great privilege to present to you the Benjamin Franklin of today the Honorable Fiorello H. LaGuardia Mayor of the City of New York who will speak on Franklin the man and citizen Mr. Friedman ladies and gentlemen now that introduction Mr. Friedman might have been alright had it not followed the address by Mr. Piggott didn't you hear Mr. Piggott say that Franklin was unemotional and patient and never used any invectives in his debate description so we'll pardon the printer's license you know it's nice to meet here once a year to commemorate the birth of one of the greatest Americans of our history this man contributed so much to many activities of life and his contributions were permanent and had great influence all through the years and all through the history of our country he was cultured and did educate himself and was the equal to the greatest minds of Europe whom he met and encountered on his very important mission for his young country history it is rare in history that we find a person who is or has a scientific mind as practical as Benjamin Franklin who was a statesman sound and certain and yet an artist he wrote beautiful things a great deal of his prose his poetry and he was a thinker and a philosopher it is quite true as Mr. Pickett said he was generous in debate but he was firm boys don't get the idea that he was a sissy he wasn't he was quite an adversary when advocating is something that he believed in and he believed in the future of our country in the reliance and resourcefulness of the people of his time he was sent to Europe on a most difficult mission at a time when kings and empires were at their very height we were a young country crude and as you've just heard educational facilities were very limited population was small people were struggling and fighting against nature to eke out an existence it was not yet the land of abundance and plenty we were by no means definite as a population as to just what form of government we wanted and the best proof of that is that the government the form of government we now enjoy and believe in was not first originally created but Franklin had definite views his was no easy task to sell America to what was then Europe we have always been so fortunate that in every crisis our country has always produced the man or the men to do the job and Franklin was the man at that time our standing in Europe was not very high there were some very false notions about America and the people who had settled it at the time but in the face of overwhelming opposition and prejudice and misinformation Franklin as an ambassador was the first to represent these settlers as a nation this body of settlers who were determined to establish to find a way of establishing what was then a hazy notion of an entirely new form of government and you know he knew human nature too and human nature was much different then than it is now he had trouble with government contracts too I always like to refer to that I went through the same thing in printing contracts when I took office and his warning was very helpful to me he was so intensely human like others public eye he was subject to attack and he readily would admit any weakness or any fault I don't know whether it was easier to do it in those days than it is now but it's always a good thing to do yes I made a mistake we all do he did and admitted so on this day a whole country yes the world pays tribute to a truly great man one who made contributions to science literature government established an example that still lives for characters one whom every generation of our country is indebted for his part in the formation of what is now the greatest democracy in the whole world next number on the program will be the singing of America by the audience accompanied by the orchestra and drum corps of the New York School of Printing led by Mr. Nelson Farber High Park loveُّ Before the exercises adjourned to City Hall Square, may I express our thanks and appreciation to the Municipal Broadcasting System and to Director Morris Novick and his assistants for making this broadcast possible.
