We hear first, The Banks of Allen Water, followed by Now is the Month of Maying. On the banks of Allen Water, where the streams bring time before, On the miller's lovely daughters, there is no temple, For his rivals of the summer, and the winnings of the year, On the banks of Allen Water, where the Lord has spread its toll, On the banks of Allen Water, where the Lord has spread its toll, There is no one on the miller's daughter, but she's blind no more. For the summer, free, and water, where the soldier falls on the knee, On the banks of Allen Water, where the sons of Allen Sheep. On the banks of Allen Water, where the winter snow fell fire, Till the scenes of miller's daughter, Till the blues of land, On the miller's lovely older, That horden's smooth all- 때문 all-being on the cal- tran- någonting, To the end of the year, goodbye. I soep it by the day by the end house, there is no purpose.
