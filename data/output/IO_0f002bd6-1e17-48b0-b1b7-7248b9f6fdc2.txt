Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The ghost is plenty of plenty, found a lot on the door. The ghost is plenty of nothing, and love is plenty of nothing. What for? What for? I've got no luck on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the drugs from the floor, that's okay to be. Oh, that's okay to be, for the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complainin'? Not my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my song. Not my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I can't go sun, can't go moon, can't go deep to sea. The ghost is plenty of plenty, got to pray all the day. Keeps the plenty, you're not the warrior, keep the devil away. Away, away. I am the friend of hell, in a time to ride. Never want me long as I'm well, never want me strive to be gone, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm the Lord? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complainin'? You complainin'?
