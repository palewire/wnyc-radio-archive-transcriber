Today the Salvation Army commemorates its 31st annual Prison Sunday. In 1,200 penal institutions throughout the United States, the Army of Peace, with its brilliant flags, its uniforms, and its sounding brasses, has brought its message of friendship and goodwill to thousands of men and women, many of whom have half forgotten, if they ever knew, the meaning of goodwill and friendship. Tonight, Station WNYC brings you the Salvation Army's Brooklyn Citadel Band and male chorus in a program of Salvation Army music, under the direction of Captain Edward Lowcock. They will start their broadcast with a Salvation Army march, victors acclaimed by Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell Coles. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ You just heard the Brooklyn Citadel Band of the Salvation Army playing the march victors acclaimed.

It's a hymn that we often associate with the Salvation Army. The Brooklyn Citadel Chorus directed by Walter Orr will sing Onward Christian Soldiers. Who has gone before Christ, the royal master, leads against the foe. Forward into battle, sing his banner's call. Onward Christian Soldiers, the King has to go. Looking unto Jesus, who has gone before. At the name of Jesus, Satan's host of thee. On them blood-washed soldiers, unto victory. Till foundations quiver at the shots of grace. Come, lift your voices. Love your anthem, praise. On, on, on, onward Christian Soldiers, the King has to go. Looking unto Jesus, who has gone before. Like a mighty army, move the church of God. Somers we are treading, where the saints have gone. We are not divided, our one body, we've won in hope and a friend. One in charity. All in yr onest Noel, he tells he is. Onward Christian Soldiers, the King has to go. Looking unto Jesus, who has gone before. Here in the studio this evening is the head of the Salvation Army Women's Prison Bureau, Major Dorothy Berry, who will tell you something about her work. Major Berry. Thank you, Mr. Child. Nearly 60 years ago, William Booth, our founder, said in writing of the Salvation Army's work among convicted persons, our people, thank God, have never learned to regard a prisoner as a mere convict with a number instead of a name. To us, he is a human being, to be cared for and looked after as a mother looks after her ailing child. I suppose that was a rather appalling statement back in the 19th century, when a prison sentence was pretty generally regarded as society's quite justifiable vengeance on those who had broken its laws. However, things have changed since then and are still changing. Each year we recognize more clearly that the purpose of our institution is not to get even with those who have broken our laws or to frighten them into obedience. Rather, we must help them become useful, contented human beings. And strangely enough, as our psychologists and caseworkers and penologists increase their understanding of the terrible loneliness, the sense of being cut off from all warm human ties, which causes the delinquent to turn against society, they come steadily closer to agreeing with the ideas of William Booth. They recognize the delinquent needs to be recognized in an individual who can be reached and helped by patient good sense and understanding. In the 11 states of our eastern territory, there are 212 penal institutions, which our officers visit at least once a month, holding religious services and interviewing all those who want help to get the best advice. Often, too, we are called into court when a prisoner needs help or to be put in our care. We also have in our charge throughout the country hundreds of paralys whom we supervise and for whom we find work and lodgings. We do all these things knowing if they are to have any real and lasting value. We must somehow win the trust and confidence of these people in such a way that we can help them to a better relationship with their fellows and to the deeper religious understanding, which we believe must be the source of spiritual regeneration and growth. Thank you, Major Berry, for what you've told us about this great work of the Salvation Army. And now, the Brooklyn Citadel Band, directed by Captain Edward Lowcock, will play The Star Lake March by Eric Ball.

First of all, I think Prison Sunday brings proof to delinquents of all ages that they are remembered. For many of them, the closing of the prison doors means that the normal outside world grows misty and vanishes. I think it does them good to realize that in every major institution in the country, and in many smaller ones, our people come to them, not judging or condemning, not condescending, not even pitying, but with warm goodwill and friendship, and a very sincere wish to share the courage and hope that comes through religious experience. Some 200,000 men and women have had an opportunity to attend our services today, and perhaps half of them will actually be blessed by it. For some, it may be the renewal of earlier contacts. For others, their first meeting with our people. To our officers, Prison Sunday brings one of the greatest opportunities for service during the year. Though we cannot free the bodies of the men and women to whom we speak, we can, if they wish it, help free their minds. And thank you once again, Major Berry. And now the Brooklyn Citadel male chorus, directed by Mr. Walter Orr, will sing the much-loved hymn, Rock of Ages. Rock of Ages Rock of Ages Rock of Ages Rock of Ages The world's unknown I will sing, I will hide myself in thee I will hide myself in thee That, of course, was the beautiful Rock of Ages, sung by the Brooklyn Citadel male chorus, directed by Mr. Walter Orr. Now the Brooklyn Citadel band of the Salvation Army will play the Crusader's hymn, beautiful Savior. I can see you again, beautiful Dave Norr, Mr. Bianchi. Shh.
