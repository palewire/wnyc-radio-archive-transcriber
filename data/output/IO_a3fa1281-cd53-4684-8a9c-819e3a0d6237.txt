The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the fog, I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, rain Goodbye, darling, I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am gone Something tells me I am near the end But the rest of the boat can 그리고 fø P발 jig I will fall. Give a soldier, boys, a marching. And I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along. Come on, join in the song. Jump on, fall in. It won't be long. We're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, hooray. Can – Amson's makes the heart grow thunder .... Lassus makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I thunder. Wondering, darling, if you're true. Distance only lands and shams there. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near you. Be near your heart. She was happy till she met you. And the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you. You will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother. Just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over. Yes, he is. Christ has been. When the sun gets flowers. No, he dies so free. He dies so free. You will see the word you said.

Give them bells, give them bells, bring it up the glory of the day. The End Two little girls in blue, lads, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lads, who won your father's heart. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted above. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow's last is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I'm true. Come, come, come, come. Ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrows. Sharing each other's strides. The rest of the man who was born, they blew her dear, I'd be kind. When they just read us, my darling, no comrade was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken. And a mother's heart has broken. There is just another thing. From the old home that we've all. There is still a memory living. There's a father unforgiving. There's a father's remains. That is still a memory living. She's hot, I'm her low. She's my Annie, I'm her toe. Good wheel valley, never to pass. With her Annie to me, it's my sweet heart. One evening in the month of May, I met old Satan on the way. I looked old Satan in the eye, if you want to get to heaven when you die. If you want to get to heaven, then go all the way. Throw it on, throw it on, throw it in. Throw it on, throw it on, throw it on. Throw it on, throw it in. Don't get the gun. Don't get the gun, get the gun. Don't get the gun. Don't get the gun. The End The End The End The End The End I'd just like to have one Just the same as that Where ever I go they shout Hello Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir Say au revoir Say au revoir Say au revoir But not goodbye But not goodbye But not goodbye The past is dead The past is dead Love cannot die What were I Were better for Had we not met I loved you then I loved you then Baby, baby Give me your answer too I love crazy For the love of you It won't be a smiling marriage I can't afford a marriage But you don't speak What must be I think so good for you When you hear The rest of things in me For joy, love And praise me You must sing And when the birds stand through In the forest of the night Is there a hot night With your heart And I sing it When you hear The rest of things in me For joy, love And praise me You must sing And when the birds stand through In the forest of the night With your heart Your heart to die We have a friend One night The night
