The radio's microphones are now in the council chamber in City Hall, and the occasion is the oath-taking ceremony of the Honorable Rudolph Halley, President-elect of the City Council of New York City. They have just made their entrance into the council chamber, and in just a few moments you'll hear the voice of Mr. David L. Schivitz, who will preside and present the regular Ottawa program. Mr. Schivitz. Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous flight, O'er the ramparts we watch were so gallantly streaming, and the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? Please remain standing while the invocation is offered by the Right Reverend Charles F. Boynton, Suffragan Bishop of New York. O God, the fountain of all wisdom, whose statutes are good and gracious, and whose law is truth, we beseech thee so to guide and bless this thy servant, Rudolph, here to be sworn into the weighty office of President of the City Council of the City of New York, that he may be the Lord, and may obtain and ordained for our governance only such things as are right and pleasing to thee and to the glory of thy name and the welfare of the people of this city. Grant unto him, O Lord, the spirit of counsel and ghostly strength, the spirit of knowledge and ghostly strength, the spirit of knowledge and true godliness, that he may discern the truth and impartially administer the law in the fear of thee alone. In the time of prosperity, fill his heart with thankfulness, and in the day of trouble, suffer not his trust in thee to fail. All of which we ask of thee, O Father Almighty, world without end. Amen.

many people Upon whom I know I can count And on whom I should say I know we The people can count For aid and assistance In this job My election Came after I had made A number of statements as to policy Of these I will not be unmindful They will always be in the forefront In every activity And I shall construe this mandate To mean That I shall engage In activity As the independent Who has been elected Turning neither to one side Nor to the other But serving All of the people Faithfully Throughout my term of office And I thank those in this room Each and every one of you On behalf of all of the people Of the city of New York Thank you Thank you Thank you Dr. Israel Goldstein Rabbi of congregation Benet Jesherin B'nai Jeshrin will pronounce the benediction. In the spirit of self-dedication to the high purposes with which these ceremonies are invested, we turn our hearts to the source of all inspiration. Thy spirit, O God, implanted in man, doth move him to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thee. Thy prophets have taught us that the measure of man's merit in thy sight is the extent of his concern with the well-being of his fellow men. Millions of thy creatures inhabit this huge and multi-complexioned metropolis. May our chosen leaders keep their minds and hearts attuned to the needs of the masses of the people. May they not hesitate to vent their cleansing wrath upon iniquity. May they bend their compassion to the weak and the underprivileged. May they devote their talents to the improvement of our city's manifold services to all its citizens. Upon him who this day assumes high office, an office to which he was elected by the people, we ask thy special blessing. May his vision of a community cleansed of its dross be matched by zeal of performance. May he be granted health and strength to endure the strain of public office. Patience to cope with the obstacles which may obstruct his path, the strength, skill to overcome them, and wisdom and resourcefulness to set ever higher goals for the progress of our community. May thy blessing, O God, bestow upon all who carry public responsibility in our city, state, and nation. May peace reign within our borders and flow from our borders like a torrent to all parts of our country. May our borders andönue us ˈorʊ hence you ˈwe all with us. May God bless you erst şw. Zon Bleach O Lord the work of our handsane The work of our handsane Do thou establish The Lord bless thee And keep thee The Lord Call his spirit to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his spirit upon thee and grant thee peace. Amen. If you will all remain seated, Mr. Halley will receive those who wish to do so in his offices downstairs, but I would like you to remain seated until the members of the Board of Estimates, the Council, can go leave the room. Radio's microphones this morning have brought you the oath-taking ceremony of the Honorable Rudolph Halley, who has just been sworn in as President of the City Council of the City of New York. Mr. Halley is now leaving the Council Chamber and is going to his own offices on the first floor of City Hall, on the east end of City Hall, where, as Mr. Schibert has just announced, he will receive the guests and friends who have come here this morning to greet him and wish him success in his new undertaking. He is now escorted by the Board of Estimates and the members of the City Council as they leave the Council Chamber in City Hall. That is all we have to report from City Hall. We return you now to our studios. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
