Today the Salvation Army commemorates its 31st annual Prison Sunday. In 1,200 penal institutions throughout the United States, the Army of Peace, with its brilliant flags, its uniforms, and its sounding brasses, has brought its message of friendship and goodwill to thousands of men and women, many of whom have half forgotten, if they ever knew, the meaning of goodwill and friendship. Tonight, Station WNYC brings you the Salvation Army's Brooklyn Citadel Band and male chorus in a program of Salvation Army music, under the direction of Captain Edward Lowcock. They will start their broadcast with a Salvation Army march, victors acclaimed by Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell Coles. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ You just heard the Brooklyn Citadel Band of the Salvation Army playing the march victors acclaimed.
