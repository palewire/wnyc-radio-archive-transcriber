Fellow New Yorkers, the Health Commissioner's report for the year 1949 shows that our city is becoming a better and healthier place in which to live. But there is one black spot in the picture. Diseases of the heart account for almost half of the total death. Heart diseases strike young and old, rich and poor. We must do everything in our power to curb them. You can help by giving the cardiac crusade some of your spare time during the 1950 New York Heart Campaign. There is a job for every one of us. Write me today in care of heart. H-E-A-R-T, New York 17. Or phone Murray Hill 8-1-400. Murray Hill 8-1-400. Ladies and gentlemen, New York City has welfare problems common to every large city in the world and some which no other city has. As mayor of New York, I want to tell you what the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies means in the total welfare picture of the city. The Federation has a vast network of hospitals, health and social services agencies for neglected, physically handicapped and dependent children. These agencies help the sick, the aged, and the emotionally disturbed of all ages. The Federation deals with these problems with a deep social insight and progressive approach which makes its contribution to the entire city truly great. Whenever Federation through one of its agencies serves one of your neighbors, it serves the whole community. For its great present work and for its great future program, I sincerely urge you to support Federation's building fund and maintenance campaign for $50,500,000. Thank you.
