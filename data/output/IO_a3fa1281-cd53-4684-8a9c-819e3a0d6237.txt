Soft eyes of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, it won't be long, we're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, hooray. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I've hunder, wondering, darling, is your true. Distance only, land and shun's land, all the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near your side. Be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother, just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, just be near, Christ is near. And the harvest days are over, and the sun gets flowers blue. He dies so clear. He dies so clear. He dies so clear. You will keep the word you say.
