In recognition of Flag Day, the municipal broadcasting system presents a dramatic tribute, The Parable of the Cloth by Lee Polk, featuring Stan Gevarts as Grandpa, Betty Ann Harmon as Laddie, and Paul Herlinger as the voice of the flag. A place? Oh, it could have happened anywhere. Anywhere in America, that is. Where else today could an old man sit with peaceful thoughts in a peaceful rocker, peacefully sewing on a small piece of cloth? Let's see. A little more blue here and I think it's done. Yes, it had to happen in America. Mostly because a question started the whole thing. You see, America is the land of questions. Anyone has a right to ask anything. Even if that anyone is an eight-year-old grandson seated before his grandfather. And even if the question is... Grandpa, what are you doing? Huh? What are you doing? A little nut on the back. Huh? There it is. Grandpa. Hmm? Grandpa, what are you doing? Grandpa! Oh, oh, oh, what am I doing? Right now I'm talking to my grandson, Laddie, who always asks me, Grandpa, what are you doing? No, I mean it. What are you doing with that piece of cloth? Boy, this is more than a piece of cloth. It's a flag. A living thing. I make one every year at this time. Why? Why? Because I've done the same thing for 43 years. But why? Well, because that's how long it was that I came to America. That's how I celebrate my anniversary. 43 years, 43 flags. Understand? I think so. Good. Now, now, go and... But why do you sew a flag? Because it means a lot to me. It means everything. I love the flag. That's why. You love a flag? Why? Why? Why do you love your grandmother? Why do you love to play with your toys? Why do you love to ask foolish questions? Why? Because I do. That's why. But I... No, but. Now, go and play with your toys. Go. Oh, I only wanted to know. Oh, never mind. Why do I love the flag? Progressive education. Why do you love the flag? I told you I... Did you call me Grandpa? No, no, no. Go on with your flag. Thought I was getting deaf. Now I'm starting to hear things. Why do you love the flag? I could swear to hear a voice coming from the flag. Piece of coal. Why are you surprised? You said I was more than cloth. A living thing. I just made you myself. Of course. A lot of people make the flag every day. Grandpa, who are you talking to? Come here, laddie. Listen very carefully. Do you hear anything? The boy can't hear me. He's too young to understand the flag. There. Did you hear that voice? Hear a voice? Sure. Right from the flag here. Didn't you hear a talk? Didn't I hear a talk? Oh. Maybe it's time for your medicine. Grandma said to give it to you every hour. My medicine. Yes, yes. All right. Go bring me my medicine. Grandpa. What? I didn't mean to ask so many questions. Oh, it's all right. I didn't mean to shout at you. And then I'll be a good boy and bring you my medicine. I'll be right back. And don't worry. Don't worry. I wish I was his age. And I wouldn't worry about talking flags. But why do you love the flag? Not only does it talk, but it has a one-track mind. Do you know? Do you know why? Yes. I'll tell you. I know. Forty-three years ago, before I came here, I used to hide when I saw a flag. Because it meant somebody was coming to rob or to hurt my family. For a while, I hated all flags. Then I came here and I saw this flag. I felt different. I felt protected. Now I feel warm when I see you. You mean security. No, I mean real security. Isn't that enough? Is it? What else do you want me to do? Stand on street corners and make speeches? Make a speech about what, Grandpa? Oh, nothing. Come here, my boy. I want to ask you something. Grandpa, honest, I didn't hear a voice. No, forget that. I want to ask you about this. This piece of cloth. Does it really mean nothing to you? Oh, no. I like it. I mean, I love it. You don't have to say that to please me, boy. It is important for you to know many things about it. What it means to you. What it'll mean to your grandson. What do you think, boy? Well, I guess so. Anything you say, Grandpa. Hey, you haven't understood a word I said. No wonder. I'm not sure I understand myself. Tell you what. Let's go to the park. There's lots of flags and lots of people. Maybe they can tell us why the flag is important. Want to go, boy? Sure. Sure. If you want to go, then... Well, there'll also be a parade and lots of ice cream and balloons. But, uh, what if you really don't feel like going... Oh, a parade? Sure, sure thing. Let's go. Let's go, Grandpa. Take me, too, Flagmaker. I want to hear what the people will say. Of course, of course. We'll all learn something good. Come along, Mr. Flag. Where are you standing, me boy? You're talking to that flag again? Yes. Well, I'll explain to you later. Come along now. Oh, Grandpa. What's the matter now? You forgot to take your medicine. Oh, what a beautiful parade. Look at this crowd. Better stay close to me, boy. I can't see a thing, Grandpa. I can't see the parade. Pardon me, sir. Could I get through? This little boy would like to see the parade. So do we, mister. We've been waiting there for two hours. Hey, Grandpa, there's a man with ice cream. Me, I, Gramps. Me, I, Gramps. Yeah, sure, sure. Yeah, but be careful. Now, don't get lost. I won't. You want some, Grandpa? No, no, you go ahead. Go ahead. Say, say, mister. Oh, mister. Yeah, what's up? I just want to ask you a simple question. Oh, go ahead. I ain't proud. Hey, Sam. There's an old guy here who wants to ask questions. Yeah? Maybe it's the inquiring photographer. What's on your mind, Pop? Could you tell me, please, why do you love the flag? What's that he said? I just want to know why you love the flag. Are you trying to kid me or something? No, no, please. It's very important. Well, tell the man. Tell him why you love the flag. Well, it's the law, ain't it? No, stupid. You pay your taxes, don't you? Yeah. You like baseball. Yeah. You got a job, a wife, a kid, so you live and let live, don't you? Yeah, so? So that's how you love the flag. You're a good American, you jerk. All right. So I'm a good American. Is that what the old man asked me? I'm not sure. Hey, Sam, maybe this guy's a sufficer. Maybe he don't like the flag. Should I hit him? Hey, Grandpa, the man had nine flavors, and I took two scoops. What's my grandpa? Sonny, I think you better take your grandpa out of here before he asks any more questions. My friend gets nervous quick, and he was like heavy tramp in the army. I suggest grandpa go to school if he wants to ask questions. I wish I could. Sorry I bothered you, mister. Ah, go tell it to your congressman. Why, that's stupid. He might be from the FBI. Uh, Grandpa? Yes? Maybe I could ask my teacher at school what you want to know. Can I? Yeah, why not? Just ask her what the flag means, that's all. I will. Hey, Gramps. What? What that man you were talking to? What did he mean, go tell it to your congressman? Oh, he didn't mean anything. Just an expression. Grandpa? Yes, boy? Why don't you? I don't know what. Why don't you tell it to your congressman? Tell it to me. Oh, forget it, boy. I can't go to my... Why not? Yes. Why not? I'll show them. I'll go. I'll go. Mr. Flag, I'm frightened. After all, this is a congressman's office. He's a busy man. His business is what you want to ask him. Go ahead and knock. All right, if you say so. But help me out if I forget what to say. You won't forget. Go ahead. Come in. Come in. Excuse me, Mr. Congressman. I just... Welcome, citizen. From my district, no doubt? Yes, but I just want to know... Oh, good. Come right in and sit down. Citizen with a flag. I fully approve, brother. Approve? What? Everybody ought to carry a flag at some time or other. I'll see to it there are more flags put around the post office and the schools. You are from the district flag committee, Orange. No, no. I just came here to do... That's probably something personal. A pension, social security, eh? It is personal, but I just want to ask you a question, that's all. Question? What kind of a question? Well, I... You look busy. Maybe I'll come back. Speak up, man. Speak up. Mr. Congressman, why should I love the flag? Yes, sir. We're working on that thing right now. If we can get the McHooey bill, who then... What did you say? I just wanted to know why I should love the flag. Haven't had a question like that in years. Well, since you asked any place to see the flag, there's a man like me working there. Well, that's good, isn't it? Yes, I think so. And what am I doing? Well, let's say you need a new pair of teeth. Well, I'll get you a clinic so it don't cost too much. Or, let's say your kid almost gets hit by a car near school. I'll get you an extra traffic cop on the corner. Or someone don't find a book in the library. Bingo! I have to get more funds. See what I mean? I'm not sure. Well, is that why I should love the flag? I don't know. I don't know. But that's why I'm a busy man. So, anytime you want to come back and ask me questions, it'll be perfectly okay. Okay? Yeah, yes. I see. Well, goodbye, Mr. Congressman. Tell your friends to come up and see me anytime. Yes, of course. Well, Mr. Flag, what can I do now? Maybe I can help you. Let me take you on a little trip. It's a long way from here and we must travel by night if you're not afraid. Afraid? No, no, no. But go on, Mr. Flag. I'll follow. But I was just thinking maybe next year instead of sewing a flag, I'll just celebrate with peaceful firecrackers. The End Mr. Flag, where have you taken me? The question you want answered is based on the past. Here you can meet the past. There's nothing here but white crosses, a whole field of white crosses. I know these crosses well. Each one is a flag maker. Each one asks the question you ask. Crosses? Flag makers? I don't understand. Listen. Do you hear that? I hear nothing. There's no one here. Look. There. What do you see? See? Good Lord. Isn't that a sword? Wait. They can see another one. Have I completely lost my senses? Listen. They're coming close. Listen. Listen carefully. I said, holler, I'll shoot. I told you it won't make any difference if you do. So put down your gun and be quiet. I'm in no mood for playing soldier boy. Well, I guess it's okay. You sound like an American. Thanks. Your uniform looks funny, though. Oh. One gets used to it. No, I mean, couldn't your quartermaster call give you a new outfit? Well, it was this way. General Washington said he'd get us some new uniforms right after Cambridge. Somehow, I just didn't give him a chance. Washington? Were you with him? That's what they told me. Gee. And what was he like? He had two heads like any other general. Well, you know, I'm a soldier, too. I really am. I mean, I was. I was with Eisenhower. Is that a man or a place? Well, he's one of the biggest generals of all time. Even during the war, they were saying something about making him president. President? Well, that's really something. What's a president? Oh, that's right. You must have been killed. I mean, you weren't around when they made Washington the first president. I guess I wasn't. What's it like? A king? No. He's head of the country, but we got a congress to sort of watch what he does. Congress? Sure. They are representatives of the 48 states. Very interesting. But I think I'd better turn in so... Did you say 48? Sure thing. There'll soon be 49, maybe more. Why, we never thought they'd get more than about 15. 15? Everybody knows we're, well, the biggest country in the world. Well, what do you know? Where do I tell the boys? 48. You're sure? Of course. Just look at that flag out there. Well, I hear you right. That flag sure changed. 48. We weren't sure at the time that anything would come of it. Yeah, I know what you mean. We weren't too sure even in this war. Well, I guess no one's ever sure. I suppose so. Thanks for the information. I've got to get back. Yeah, me too. This is my first night on guard duty. Guess I'd better walk around a bit. Yes. See you around sometime. So long. And say... Yes. Well, thanks. So long. Well, flag maker. Do those boys... I mean, do they still have to do guard duty? Can't they rest now? Can any of us rest? Perhaps someday, when we understand more, they'll be able to rest. I think I understand more, Mr. Flag. But is your question answered, flag maker? I think so. Yes, I really think so. Are you ready to tell your grandson? My grandson? Oh, my goodness. Glad he'll be coming home for supper soon. Can't keep a growing American waiting. I know the way, Mr. Flag. This time, you follow me. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Very good, children. You may be seated. Today, in honor of our flag, we're going to play a little quiz game. How'd you like that? Oh, good. All right, children. I'll pick two children for each side of the room. And I'll ask three questions of each side. Then I'll take two more children until everyone's had a chance to play. And, oh, yes. The winning team, aside from their A's, will get to see any movie, museum, television show, or anything else they want to see. All right? Oh, let me see. Let me see. First, I'll pick Doris and Jean for one side. And, uh, oh, well, Jimmy, and, uh, how about you, Laddie? Yes, I would. But I'd like to ask you something for my grandpa. Oh, your questions come later. Today, I ask the questions. Is everybody ready? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Doris, what do we celebrate on flag day? Uh, the adoption of our flag by the Continental Congress on June 14, 17, uh, 1777. Very good. That's one point for your side. All right, Jimmy, who originated the pledge that we say every morning? Uh, it was, uh... I'll, uh, give you a hint. His first name is like a girl. Oh, I know. Uh, uh, uh, Francis. That's right, Francis. Francis, uh, Francis Scott Key. Well, not quite. It was Francis Bellamy in 1892. But I'll give you a half a point for a good try. All right, Jean, you're next. Let's give you a real hard one. On what day can a star be added to the flag? Um, well, uh, I'm not, I'm not sure. I, I... But I, I think on, on the, the July 4th after the state is accepted by Congress... Oh, very good. Very, very good. It looks as if the girls are going to run away with this contest. I guess it's up to you, laddie. Let's see. Here's your question. Who originated the name Old Glory? Oh, oh, I guess it was, um, Captain... Captain, yes. Captain... Shh, children, don't help him. He knows it. I remember. Captain William Drivers on his own ship. That's right. Captain Drivers in 1831. And now I... Teacher, please, I have to ask. What is it? What is it, laddie? Oh, yes, you get a full point. No, no, I want to know. I mean, Grandpa wants to know why we should love the flag. I mean, what does the flag stand for? I'm... I'm not sure I understand. Well, he just wants to know why should we love the flag. All right. Children, laddie wishes to know why we should love the flag. Well, I'll tell you why I love the flag. Because it gives me an opportunity to teach you children and to play quiz games with you. So what do you say we finish our game? Does that answer your question, laddie? I hope so. I'll tell Grandpa. I'll tell him right away. I'll go right now and I'll tell him. Laddie, laddie, come back. You're still in the quiz game. Laddie! Oh, well. Tommy, you take his place. But mind you children, I'll do all the asking from now on. After all, someone has to finish this game. Hey, Grandpa. I'm home. Hey, Grandpa. Grandpa, where are you? I found out. Hey, Grandpa. Here I am, laddie. Grandpa, I've got to tell you. Never mind. Let me give you some milk. I think Grandma made a chocolate cake. Wait a minute. I've got to tell you. I found out what you wanted me to ask the teacher. She said she likes flags because it lets her teach boys and girls and also lets her play games with them. Is that what you wanted to know, Graham? Yes. That's just what I wanted to know. Okay. Then I better... Hey, no, no. Don't go yet. I, uh... Well, sit down here, laddie. Sure, but... I want you to tell me. Did you learn anything today about this piece of cloth? Yes, Grandpa. I did. It seems to tell almost everything that happened in this country. Is that what I should have learned, Grandpa? Yes. You learned quite a bit. And I learned something, too. You, Grandpa? Yes, even me. I guess you know by this time, this flag I hold in my hand is more than a piece of cloth. It's a living thing. It's been living for about 175 years. Schools and newspapers and even... Don't let your grandmother hear this. Even her chocolate cake. That's what this flag tells me. You mean that flag still talks to you? Well, in a way, it sort of reminds us who we are and the work we must do. Work? Well, what can I do, Grandpa? Just keep going to school. Keep growing strong and healthy. And God help me keep asking questions. Because who knows? Someday you may be a congressman who's too busy doing things for people to figure out why he does these things. Or you may be the average man who likes baseball, pays taxes, lives, and lets live like the man at the parade. He was funny, Grandpa. He was so big. And so American, my boy. He was ready to fight for something he couldn't really explain. But something he felt was right for himself and his family. And that's the point of the whole thing. Why, Grandpa? We don't have to know why we love the flag in order to work for it just as it works for us. To protect it just as it protects us. What we should know is how to work for it. How we can get the right things done in the shortest time. You'll know you're doing right because, well, you'll feel it. Your children will feel it. The whole world will feel it. And this flag, your flag, will show it. You've answered your question, flag maker. I'm ready now to join your other 42 flags. And happy anniversary. Grandpa. What is it, boy? Grandpa, I heard something. I heard something like a voice. You'll hear it again if you have to. Well, laddie, are there any more questions? No. Well, not exactly. Speak up, boy. Ask me anything. Well, when do I get my chocolate cake? In recognition of Flag Day, the municipal broadcasting system has presented, transcribed, a dramatic tribute, The Parable of the Cloth by Lee Polk.
