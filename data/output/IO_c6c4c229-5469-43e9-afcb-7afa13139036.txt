Ladies and gentlemen, today a train of common boxcars filled with hope will head across the country from Los Angeles. This train carries life-giving food for the people of France and Italy, every pound of which has been contributed by Americans. The cars of the train, the locomotive that pulls them, and the trucks that deliver the food, all have been contributed by Americans. As this friendship food train passes through our cities and towns, there will be more food waiting at each of them for those who need it to survive the winter. This train operates on hot power. It is an expression of the neighborliness of Americans, and it will keep a lot of hearts beating in Europe. It is the hope of those whose humanity prompted them to fill this train that a shipload of food can leave New York in time to reach Italy on Christmas Day and that another will arrive in France as a New Year dawns. We, like all of you, intend to donate all the flour, all the macaroni and spaghetti, all the sugar, dried peas and beans, and evaporated milk that we can possibly spare to go aboard the Friendship Food Train. I have mentioned specific foods. It is important to keep these in mind because shipping requirements and food needs are such that these are the items that will serve best. Here in New York City and throughout the country, special citizen committees are working to help you help the Friendship Food Train. Your newspapers and radio stations will carry full details of what is needed and how you can participate. Your railroads, your businessmen, your organizations, and your schools are all part of this effort. The Friendship Food Train arrives in New York City on November 18, ten days from today. It must be here then because hunger will not wait. The food we send is our message of friendship and of hope for those who need these precious gifts. The most. The most.
