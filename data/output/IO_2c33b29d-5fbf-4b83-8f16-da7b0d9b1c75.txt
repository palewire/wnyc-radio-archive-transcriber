Here the tramples, Saxon-Fomen, Saxon-Spearmen, Saxon-Fomen, be they nice, or high, or yaw, and they'll fight the ground. Through the folds of thunder, flag we conquer under, the flag that tries not to fight, nor the logic of all is under. From where the country needs us, he is brave as he who leads us, on excel how proud he has done, freedom, love, and rise. The flag that lasts narrow, flash with fear and flight of harrow, fluid danger of death or sorrow, death is glory now. Earl the reeling, harkmen, o'er, let the earth gentlemen cover. Bring a friend, a wife, a lover, tremble on the floor. Strands of life are riven, flow for flow is given. In the land of the sea, a bird of the sea, and may be to heaven. Men of the lake, young of the glory, would you win a name in glory? Cry for hope, for life, for glory. Freedom, God, and Christ. For their third and concluding number, the Glee Club presents, Benny Havens, a ballad sung by Sons of West Point for over a hundred years, and sung today wherever West Pointers gather. Come fill your glasses, fellows, and stand up in our row, To singing sentimentality, we're going far to go. In the army there's so priety, promotion very slow. So we'll sing our grand-decented of Benny Havens, O. O Benny Havens, O. O Benny Havens, O. To our kind old alma mater, our rock-bound highland home, We'll cast back many upon regret, as for life's peace we roam. Until on our last battleship, the lights of heaven shall flow. We'll never fail to drink through birth, as Benny Havens, O. O Benny Havens, O. O Benny Havens, O. We'll sing our grand-decented of Benny Havens, O. May the army be augmented, so more than we let's flow. May our country in the hour of me be ready for the fall. Good night and good-do backstage, maybe we let's flow. The rain meets the land if rollingle down. Let's pray for the kingdom of the Anglikates, o. Say, please, pass the kingdom of the shore. As verse of the yellow and allied�aba will be Stay, come from where theom qualified will be tray. If Ми äns, O. That is the main-the 다음-to-be scripted of the poor Oh, Pennyhaven's hope, we'll sing our rest, many advances of Pennyhaven's hope. From West Point, we conclude this quarter hour of song by the Cadet Glee Club, conducted by Cadet G.S. Harper, with warrant officer Barry Drews in charge, and Cadet W.S. Fisher, pianist. On Tuesday, June 4th at 10 a.m., the address of Secretary of War Patterson to the graduating class will be broadcast over station WNYC. This is Major Bill Hood speaking and returning you to the studios of the Municipal Broadcasting System. The Municipal Broadcasting System including a church in London, at the wedding scene as richer activity across the vicomilians in the Quest, but for to understand each other, you will never evander their futures гарiony check, It has been an inspiration for the whole world. Those who have never had the chance to see our great borough, come here to see our tall buildings, our great manufacturers, our many things of the interest that help supply the good things all over the world. Oh, people, when the opportunity comes to you, kindly visit our borough. We are the borough of good-hearted people, good-natured people. No drive was ever started in the borough of Brooklyn that ever fell down. This borough has been generous in everything. Warfront drives, Red Cross drives, Warfront drives, Cancer drives, and many, many others. Because the people of Brooklyn were always generous, and they give, they give them out to this hunger famine all over the world. And I hope the world in return won't take advantage of ours, as has been done on many occasions, but love and enjoy the friendship, not alone of the borough of Brooklyn, but the good people that come from all parts of the world to make our country what it is today. And Brooklyn is one of the springs in our country that has developed, and we in Brooklyn are very, very proud that we are residents of this borough. I thank you. Now, Pete, you've committed a grave error. You haven't said a word about Greenpoint. Well, I wanted to be a little modest. I want to feel this way, that to me, Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world. It is a spot where I was raised and first seen the light of day. At number 132, Eagle Street, thanks be to God there was a Greenpoint. Thanks be to God that the light of day gave me my opportunity. And to the people of Greenpoint, I worked and worked the same as every other man, and labored on the docks. I pulled lumber. I worked in the whole of vessels. I'm proud to tell you I was a long shaman. I'm delighted to say that I worked with men, and I've done the same thing as every other man done. Worked for an honest living, and thanks be to God for that. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? Well, I'd surely, I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more, and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building housing a Borough President. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836, and then a depression set in, and it lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected in 1848. That's when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land, which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there, on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down, and we're going to build $11.5 million, Kings County, Supreme Court building. Then you go down a little further, and we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there, and we're going to renovate that and use it there. We're out of a car. In other words, thanks a lot. We're here at Brooklyn, at Borough Hall. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old, just two years more, and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building housing a Borough President. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836, and then a depression set in, and it lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected in 1848, when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land, which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there, on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down, and we're going to build $11.5 million, Kings County Supreme Court building. When you go down a little further, we're going to have a brand-new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there, and we're going to renovate that and use it for a federal court. This whole Brooklyn Civic Center is going to be flanked on both sides by public buildings, and right in the center of it, it's going to be a war memorial, and it's going to be a useful one instead of brick, lime, lumber, and cement. It's going to be an honor of the 327,000 boys and girls who fought in this war. And don't forget, Brooklyn supplied more, and that 327,000, and the many of 39 states in the Union. In this war memorial, you're going to have an auditorium that holds 1,500 people. And then you're going to have a room on the right where the trophies that our boys captured from the four corners of the world are going to be on display. And then on the left-hand side is going to be a room in bronze where the names will be inscribed of every boy and girl who made the supreme sacrifice. And downstairs, this is very interesting, and I believe you'll like it. We're going to have a room for each of the veterans' organizations, which isn't anywhere in the city of New York. We're going to have the American Legion, the King's County, the Spanish War veterans, the Catholic War veterans, and the Jewish War veterans. They're all going to be down there in that one building. So if any of these 327,000 veterans need assistance, they'll have a central location point to which to go. Thank you. I appreciate you very much, Mr. President. Your busy life stepping by this way and taking a few moments. That was quite a celebration you had down at Hamilton Ferry, wasn't it? Do you want to say a word about that? Yes, that was a big thrill. I'll tell you a little about that. A ferryboat known as the Moran Tugboat Company supplied it as a company. Well, he lives in Brooklyn, and he's a resident. I wonder if we can pick up somebody here, will you? I shouldn't say pick up, that's the wrong term. He's a new cabot. I was walking across the square with Pete McGinnis sometimes, very athletic young man shook hands with him, and he says, How are you, he says. .. Drew .... He always had a ustle in Zukunft. The station was removed, but from thetitrage ated principalmente, he says, He passed away that Feelings union was guarded.
