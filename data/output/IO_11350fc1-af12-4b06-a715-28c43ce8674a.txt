And now we're greatly honored to have in our audience tonight Mayor O'Dwyer and Mrs. O'Dwyer. Ladies and gentlemen, his honor, the mayor of New York. Thank you. Mr. K, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not back on the sidewalk yet. I'm up in the clouds. Everyone in this theater must have enjoyed the privilege of listening to these boys and girls. We are proud of them. We are proud of their teachers. We are proud of the entire Department and Board of Education. May God bless them all. Thank you. You have to be a tightrope talker, too. Ladies and gentlemen, we know that the school system of New York has long encouraged a musical education. And we know that these young people who have so skillfully, brilliantly contributed to your delight tonight have given their time freely to these rehearsals on Saturday morning when you could sleep late and when you could just get that little bit extra in. Not for them. Here they are every Saturday morning singing, siddling, and doing all the things that make sense. So, I pay tribute to them as my publisher has. But I want you to know that your school system has always encouraged musical education. And I know that because I know the man, and I know that he has in the past been a sponsor and an advocate of learning to play because she may have a sister sometime and would like to play a piano. So, I have the greatest pleasure at this time to introduce, not for the first time, because you all know him. And it's my pleasure to introduce to you Mr. Maximilian Moss, President of the Board of Education. Mr. Moss. Thank you.
