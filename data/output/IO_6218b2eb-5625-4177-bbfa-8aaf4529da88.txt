Good afternoon everyone. Each afternoon for the past six days we brought you a special program in connection with National Fire Prevention Week. Today is the final day of National Fire Prevention Week. Nevertheless, let's make every day in the year a day in which we'll do all we can to prevent the ever-lurking enemy fire. During the past week we've alternated the musical portion of this program with the Fire Department Band and Glee Club of the New York Fire Department, Patrick Walsh, Fire Commissioner and Chief of Department. And today we have the pleasure of having both organizations with us again. And later our guest speaker will be Mr. John J. Hogan, Office of Administration. But first now, here is the Fire Department Band conducted by Deputy Chief George F. Bregel playing, drooping the line with the colors and tribute to trombones. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Every day they play in song. Hear me, and lay his son. Hear me, and lay his son. And lay his son. Hope will bring to us his gladness. Faith shall take away all sadness.
