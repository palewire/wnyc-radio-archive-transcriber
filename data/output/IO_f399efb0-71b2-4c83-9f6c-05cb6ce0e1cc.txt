You have eager for your plans that you have inizi efforts to translate the claszam niin for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scarni of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased, indeed, to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And, Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the Mayor and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Pertuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it's with profound commotion that I've heard your words affectionate and cordiales revolting to my modest person and to the noble city that I've here comentarios were honored byверa making and if done occur it's made an order and if so after she passed by这 10 I voy to She is a great visit to all of us. She has also been given homage to the city of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, on the other hand, is also been sent to Genova to democracy, which is so dear to the people of the United States, but so dear to the Italians and the genoveses, especially. Thank you very much. So, this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, on the impenetra. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and its mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. This visit is the asking that it is, this was延ato of a democracy and our national doubt, on the nation and the 70s, and on what we have donated. and that has contributed modestly to reconstitue it, it is a salute of this man and of the Italian population to the great people of the United States, to the United States, which we are deeply grateful because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to give us freedom when he intervened so potent in war and to protect them today with many material sacrifices and of men also, so today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently to defend democracy in Europe and in all the world. Well, the Hon. Impeliteri, the Hon. Sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work because the democratic freedom will be really extended to everyone and there will be peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For some time we Italians don't understand it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just the moment we were gravating from the weight of the conflict. We were lost in the country, we were lost in the country, we were lost in the country in which our work could be exploited, we were lost in the misery and the ravine, but the power of this power, this power of this democratic freedom was so alive that we had taken our work, we had to work, we worked, we were lost in the country and we were lost in the country and we were lost in the country. We had to do it and we were lost in the country in this country. It is with these sentiments, our Hon. Impeliteri, we salute you and the city of New York and say that we are tenacious we are in the work of the reconstruction of the democracy in our country. We are tenacious and we have examples we have examples. We have examples we have examples of such a Genoa. The tenacity of Colombo in searching your own land is an example of all the Genoveses. The tenacity of Colombo in searching your own land is an example of all the Genoveses. Don't matter if he doesn't find the passage. Don't matter if each of us doesn't find the passage. The time's to persist, and others will find the way. The way that everyone is free in peace and in work. Thank you. which have a significance in themselves and are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us. And we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great man which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
