Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. The Vive exposing them to an incredible storm in torты, a very strong rosequerque, and a very highly compassionate conquest. The End The End The End The End Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications, as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has, on many occasions, proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. May your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scurney of Genoa during his visit here to scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased, indeed, to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the Mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it's with profound commotion that I've heard your words affectionate and cordiales revolting to my modest person and to the noble city watching. There's five feet and act that we can't accomplish in any means people. And every act that man want to accomplish is their weapon to the role of their meaning. But there are the form that have special meaning. So when you, honorable Inpeniteri, reached on Europa and reached plate and走 of our city She has also made a visit of cordiality, a great honor to all of us. She also gave homage to the mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent to the people of the Genovese so connected to the land of America. But she, especially on the name of Imperiteri, was also been in the Genova ambassador of democracy. That is so expensive to the United States, but so expensive to the Italian and the Genovese, especially. For this, on the Imperiteri, we are grateful for her because she was a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States and so every citizen of America, independent of its origin and social class, will come she has been able to come to the city as she has been able to represent the city. So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, on the Imperiteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and to his mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. means that for all to the 터x democratic life and that has contributed modestly to reconstitution it is the salute of this man and the Italian population to the great people of the United States, to the United United States, which we are deeply grateful because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to give us freedom democratic freedom when intervened so potent in the war and to protect them today with many material sacrifices and men also, so today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently because we defend the democracy in Europe and really in the world. And, well, onorevole Impeliteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work because the democratic freedom are really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For sometimes we Italians don't understand it. We must remember that the democracy in Italy is just the moment we were gravated by the weight of the confliction. We have lost the country in which our work could be exploited, misery and roving, but the attack of this force, this democratic freedom was so alive that we have taken our work, we have worked, we work, we work, we work, we work, we work for to rebuild moral and materialize our country. It is with these sentiments, onorevole Impeliteri, that I salute you and the city of New York and tell you that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of democracy in our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples. We have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacity of Colombo in looking for your land is an example to all of the genoveses. Deriso, non creduto, contrastato da ogni avversità, dagli uomini e dagli avvenimenti. Quest'uomo sapeva che questa grande terra esisteva e l'ha cercata disperatamente. E' andato sondando alle foci dei fiumi, e' andato cercando negli estuari, ovunque, cercando quel passaggio che lui voleva trovare per congiungere tutto il mondo sotto la croce cristiana? Ebbene, non importa se lui poi non ha trovato il passaggio, non importa se ognuno di noi non trova il passaggio, bisogna persistere altri, troverà la strada, la strada perché tutto il mondo sia libero in pace e nel lavoro. Mr. Pavia, will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and their acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to general, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which mean so much to us. And we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, which is, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the the Indians. Perhaps it didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end we shall succeed, we shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome.
