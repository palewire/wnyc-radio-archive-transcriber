From City Hall Plaza, your city station brings you the mayor's official reception to the members of the 20th Annual United States Conference of Mayors. Participating in the welcoming ceremonies are the Honorable Grover A. Whalen, Mayor David L. Lawrence of Pittsburgh, the Honorable Donald L. McKay of Calgary, Alberta, and New York's own mayor, the Honorable Vincent R. Impeletere, who will offer the city's greetings. This afternoon in City Hall Plaza, you are hearing the fire department band, but the entire plaza is filled with hundreds, literally hundreds, of members of the various armed services. It is very bright with color, although it's a fairly gray day. One section devoted to the Navy, one section devoted to the Army, another to the Air Force, the Marines, and the police band. And City Hall Plaza is very rapidly filling up. More than 600 of the nation's top municipal administrators and their guests from seven foreign lands have been gathering since yesterday for the opening session of the 20th Annual Session of the United States Conference of Mayors. The mayors and public officials will hear major addresses by government leaders on such civic problems. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. Ladies and gentlemen, would you please join me and let us all sing together? Together. Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight The national anthem of the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air In hope through the night That our flag was still there For safe does that star-spangled banner yet That our flag was still there For safe does that star-spangled banner yet The national anthem Of the night That our flag was still there For safe does that star-spangled banner yet wave The national anthem of the night That our flag was still there For safe does that star-spangled banner yet wave For safe does that star-spangled banner yet wave For the land of the free And the home of the free And the home of the brave And the home of the brave Say does that star-spangled banner yet wave For the land of the free and the home of the brave. And now here is Grover A. Whalen, chairman of the mayor's reception committee to open this afternoon's program. Incidentally, Ms. Mayor, it's a pleasure for me to present to you the delegates to the United States Conference of Mayors and also the international delegates who are here from the cities of Vienna, Austria, Ankara, Turkey, Calgary, Alberta, Mayor of Athens, Greece, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Mayor of San Diego, Chile, and the distinguished mayors of the cities of the United States to the numbers of 250. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Whalen, our distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to welcome you, my fellow mayors, and the other municipal officials from the cities of this and other friendly nations to this 20th annual meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors. This reception is being held in your honor because our city is proud indeed to have you as guests for this and for your very important deliberations in these critical days. May I assure you that everything possible has been done to make your stay among us a pleasant and a memorable one. This distinguished assemblage here in historic City Hall Plaza can result only in better and closer international relations since many of you come from the capitals and major cities of distant lands. A gathering such as this, where we all meet on equal footing to discuss mutual problems, is possible only in our free democracies, and of course, utterly impossible in any of the unfortunate enslaved countries behind the Iron Curtain. Here we can talk freely of our problems without fear of reprisals, for thanks to the God-given rights guaranteed us by our Constitution. Our people enjoy the right peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. And through this famed article of this basic law, we also enjoy freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. We cherish and zealously guard these freedoms against any violations. For the day we permit even the slightest infringement of them, that day will mark the beginning of the end of our free institutions. Imagine the bleak despair that would be ours if our press were robbed of its freedom by artful communist agents, as they have done in the Iron Curtain countries. Once they shackled our press, the other freedoms that made our country great would disappear overnight. Free speech and free assembly would be no more. Our right to worship would vanish, as it has in Russia and its satellite nations. And there would be no such meeting as we have here today, with representatives from abroad, from Canada, and from South America. We must never relax our vigilance in safeguarding these freedoms, even though these very freedoms are being used by the lackeys of communist Russia in their inglorious attempt to destroy our liberties. These vicious fifth columnists masquerade under various highly deceptive political labels. And I only wish I could say that they were just fooling themselves. But the sad truth is that they are deceiving thousands of others, not only here in America, but in all the freedom-loving countries of the world. This is indeed a critical time in our national history, that we, the mayors and executive officers of the cities of the free world, are met to take counsel on the many problems that beset us, be they fiscal, legislative, civil defense, or administrative. At the business sessions for the rest of the week, we will discuss these problems. Let us hope that you will find time between your labors to get in a few hours of relaxation and become better acquainted with us. We of New York City are proud that you have honored us by holding your 20th anniversary conference here in our city. It is significant to note that more than 600 city officials from over 200 American cities, extending from the east to the west coast, and from Texas to Minnesota, and representatives of 25 foreign cities are in attendance at this, the largest meeting in the long history of the United States Conference of Mayors. Both domestic and foreign affairs will be discussed at the Szechuans, continuing today, tomorrow, and coming to their conclusion on Saturday. The eyes of the world are focused upon us because the participants include so many distinguished municipal leaders from Canada to the north, from South American countries, and from abroad. I know that I bespeak what is in the hearts of everyone here when I ask for divine guidance in the important deliberations which have brought us together from the far corners of the earth. We are met in the United Nations capital of the world and almost within the shadows of the great edifice to the north that houses this great organization in which the pulled strength of the freedom-loving peoples of the world seek to bring a greater measure of peace to men and women everywhere. We can render a real service in our conferences during the next few days by giving voice to the unity and to the idealism which bind us together in safeguarding our way of life. Ladies and gentlemen, on this occasion, on behalf of the people of the city of New York that I represent, it's my great honor and great privilege to present to some of our visiting mayors from abroad, from South America, from Canada, the city's scroll of distinguished service. May I first ask Honorable France Jonas, the mayor of Vienna, Austria, to step forward to receive the city's scroll for distinguished service. Mayor Jonas, it's my great pleasure to present you with this scroll of distinguished service. Mayor Vidal of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It's also my pleasure to present the city's distinguished scroll to Mayor Vidal of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My pleasure to present the city's distinguished scroll to Mayor Domingue Ecaracqui, Mayor of Santiago, Chile. Mayor Vidal of Athens, Greece. Mayor of Athens, Greece. My pleasure to present the city's distinguished scroll to Mayor Atif Ben Yerliulu, Mayor of Ankara, Turkey. My pleasure to present the city's scroll for distinguished service to his worship, Donald H. Mackay, Mayor of Calgary, Alberta. My pleasure to present the city's scroll for distinguished service to the Mayor of Genoa, Italy, Victorio Pertuzio, who is represented here by Dr. Savini. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, wait till we get finished. We'll be finished in a minute. Replying for the distinguished international mayors who were just presented with a scroll will be the Honorable Donald H. Mackay, Mayor of Calgary, Alberta. Mr. Chairman, the Honorable Mayor of New York, if I as a Canadian or as representing those who are here tonight or today from other countries were to ask the question, what is an American, I would answer it this way. It's an individual capable of taking all the best ideas of the old world and developing them on a higher scale to something new and something better in the Western world of ours. By that I mean he would take the fundamental democracy that was born in that heroic little country of Greece and he would build it into the Declaration of Independence. He would show the tenacity and the determination that characterizes his people, such as we would find coming in men that would hail from a country like Turkey. He would show enthusiasm and an open heart like we always find in South America when people come from Rio and from Chile. And we'd find the hard work and the effort that characterizes the Italian people and the Australian people and the Austrian people. The culture and the music would come with them. The American would take these things and make them something better. And we find as time goes by that he, the same American, would enlist a few Canadians as his counterpart to go along with them in building up the United States of America and more particularly today, this great city of New York. Now he would take all the peoples of the world as the United States has to do these things. I have been specific because these countries I have named are represented here today on this platform and we, unitedly, would like to express our sincere thanks and appreciation to the United States of America and more particularly to the mayor of New York for the hospitality that this city always affords the visitor and for the privilege and the opportunity we have of learning by observing what you in the United States are doing to build a better standard of municipality administration. Thank you from all of us for the privilege of being here. Thank you, Mayor McKay. I tried to make you a nourishment a few moments ago but it didn't, I didn't get away with it. The response for the United States Conference of Mayors will be made by a very distinguished gentleman whom we all know very well here in New York and a man who used to come here with $100 in his pocket and spend a month seeing all the shows and everything else. He's found the prices have changed a little bit since those days. But on the way up, one of the neighbors in one of the buildings said, Hey, Grover, who's that fellow with you? And he's one of the most distinguished of our visitors here and a constant one. And I think after Pittsburgh, PA, he loves New York. It's a great pleasure for me to present the Honorable David L. Lawrence, Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Mr. Whalen, Mayor Impelitieri, ladies and gentlemen, it's true what Grover has said. I was brought down to my size just as we left the battery. In Pittsburgh, I think I'm quite an important person. But when a fellow yelled out the building, Grover, who is that fellow with you? I was put in my proper place. However, when you're competing with the great celebrities who've come up Broadway and occupied this platform over the many, many years, I can fully appreciate how the young man felt. I'm just as fascinated with New York today as I was when Grover said I was a young chap, 15 or 16, and made my first trip to this great city. I still look at the large buildings and am amazed at the many things that I see. And I'm just as much a hick today as I was then. Because there's something fabulous about this great city of New York. And I've just checked up a few things, and I'm going to be brief, about this city. When we realize that the population here is 7,984,000. That is ten times the population of the city of Pittsburgh. And I'm sure the illustrious mayor of this city has ten times the headaches that I have. In the city of New York, do you realize the population here is larger than 43 out of the 48 states in the Union? New York City's population is greater than the combined population. Populations, if you will, of Arizona, Delaware, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, and Vermont, with Alaska and the Virgin Islands thrown in for good measure. The school attendance of this great city here is 948,318. In other words, it's larger than the entire population of our sixth city, Baltimore. I'm sorry Tommy D'Alessandro isn't here, so I could rub that in a little. According to the 1950 census, New York City has a municipal personnel on its payroll as large as the total population of Richmond, Virginia. Municipal expenditures in 48 and 49 fiscal year amounted to $1,169,000, compared with revenues of $1,144,000. In both instances, the amounts are several hundred million more than those of the state government of New York. And to illustrate in a measure how this city has grown, as comparing it with the thoughts of the founders of this city and the builders of this city hall, which was erected in 1803 and in 1812, when the five borough area, which comprises the greater cities, the greater cities, only had 100,000 people. And you can see what they had in their mind when they faced City Hall to the south, whereas the city has grown to its great magnitude above. Now that sounds like a speech of the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the city of New York. But as Mr. Whelan has said, New York is a part of all of us, just as much a part of Pittsburgh and Houston and Sacramento, Seattle and San Francisco as it is of itself. And we're very happy to be here. And we know New York hospitality. We've enjoyed it in the Conference of Mayors for many, many years. And I'd like to say this in closing. It is true that a great work in our conference is to try to create a better feeling throughout the world at our level of government. I said this up at the opening of the conference, and I'm happy to repeat it here. We have gone over to meetings of the mayors in Europe and up to Canada, and they come here. We're trying at our level of government, the municipal level, to show the peoples of the great democracies how we can work together for a permanent peace. The illustrious and great mayor of this city made a pilgrimage a short time ago to Europe, and in my opinion, he did an excellent job in spreading that spirit of goodwill among the Europeans. And we will continue it here until such day that together with those in the higher echelons of government, we will have acquired what the great Prince of Peace wants us to acquire, the peace of the world, to live in peace and amity among the peoples of the entire world. And let us all hope and let us pray that in the not too far distant future, we will have reached that goal and we will have real peace on earth and genuine goodwill among men. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You speak like an old New Yorker. Mr. Mayor, will you stand with the gentlemen you have just given the scrolls to so the press can get some pictures, please, with the President of the United States Conference. The gentlemen from the various cities are standing now posing for photographers. And in just a few minutes, they will leave for their luncheon and later sessions this afternoon. You've been listening to Mayor Vincent Arum Pelletieri's official reception to the 20th Annual United States Conference of Mayors and its delegates from the United States and abroad. This has been presented by your city station as a public service. May we invite you to be with us at 2 o'clock this afternoon for the luncheon session and at 3 p.m. for another business session of the Conference of Mayors. We return you now to our studios in the Municipal Building. of our studios in the sentiments of the United States Conference of Mayors, we return you to the new nhclaz in the stations for the new��fact and specialties for the new opportunity to support the new meeting.
