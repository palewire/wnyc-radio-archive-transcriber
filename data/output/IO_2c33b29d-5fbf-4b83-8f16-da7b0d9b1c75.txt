The murder way From thy ruins To the dead Chattered dark And broken heart Long recall The wolf of might Of thy kind Of papers first Never shall Thy trees return The pilgrims' stars From you The tragedy Of a mere Little longing THE END On waves and surging fall off, At all distance found. Here the trampled Saxon-Omen, Saxon-Spearmen, Saxon-Omen. Be they guys, or hide our yeomen, They they'll fight the ground. To the folds of thunder, Flag we conquer under, The flag that tries, or hide our yeomen, For the fold in thunder. From where the country needs us, He is brave as he who leads us, On a self, how proud he has done, Freedom, God, and rise. The sea's and glasses narrow, Flash with fear and slight of harrow, Fluid danger of death or sorrow, Death is glory now. Earl the reeling, Hartman-Omen, Omen, Let the earth, Gentleman cover, Bring a friend, a wife, a lover, Treble on the floor.

For their third and concluding number, the Glee Club presents Benny Havens, a ballad sung by sons of West Point for over a hundred years, and sung today wherever West Pointers gather. Come fill your glasses alone, and stand up in our row, to singing sentimentally, we're going for to go. In the army there's so priety, from motion very slow, so we'll sing our grand reminiscence of Benny Havens, all. Oh, Benny Havens, all. Oh, Benny Havens, all. We'll sing our reminiscence of Benny Havens, all. To our kind old alma mater, our rock-bound island home, we'll cast back many upon regret, as for life's peace we roam. Until on our last battle's fear, the lights of heaven shall flow. We'll never fail to drink through birth, and Benny Havens, all. We'll never fail to sing our grand comes rapid. The land there's different set of many havens more. May the army be augmented, so more than sea let's flow. May our country in the hour of peace be ready for the fall. May the time the soldiers let you face the soldiers' road. We'll throw me now, peace, my heart's name, for many havens more. O many havens more, O many havens more. We'll drink our red men yet then bread of many havens more. From West Point, we conclude this quarter hour of song by the Cadet Glee Club, conducted by Cadet G.S. Harper, with Warrant Officer Barry Drews in charge, and Cadet W.S. Fisher, pianist. On Tuesday, June 4th at 10 a.m., the address of Secretary of War Patterson to the graduating class will be broadcast over Station WNYC. This is Major Bill Hood speaking and returning you to the studios of the Municipal Broadcasting System. The Municipal Broadcasting System. The Municipal Broadcasting System. The Municipal Broadcasting System. The Municipal Broadcasting System. From Every One Pacific. May we introduce Pete McGinnis, what do you think of anything being 300 years old? Well, I want to let my good friends know that there's been 300 years of royal welcome, that we have in the Borough of Brooklyn. And in this Borough, gathered many tongues of many nations all over the world. all over the world. And we live all happy together, no matter what race we come to, no matter what our religion is. God has given us that feeling that we shall continue to love one another, irrespective of our religion, our politics, as long as we are all good fellows together. I say in this great horror, in 300 years, it has developed, and it's been a thing of an inspiration for the whole world. Those that have never had the chance to see our great horror, highly come here to see our tall villains, our great manufacturers, our many things of the interest that help supply the good things all over the world. Oh, people, when the opportunity comes to you, kindly visit our horror. We are the horror of good-hearted people, good-natured people. No drive was ever started in the horror of Brooklyn that ever fell down. This horror has been generous in everything. War front drives, Red Cross drives, War front drives, cancer drives, and many, many others, because the people of Brooklyn were always generous, and they give, they give them out to this hunger, famine, all over the world. And I hope the world, and the time, won't take advantage of us, as has been done on many occasions, for love and a joy, the friendship, not alone of the borough of Brooklyn, but the good people that come from all parts of the world to make our country what it is today. and Brooklyn is one of the springs in our country that has developed, and we in Brooklyn are very, very proud that we are residents of this borough. I thank you. Now, Pete, you've committed a grave error. You haven't said a word about Greenpoint. Well, I wanted to be a little modest. I want to feel this way, that to me, Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world. It is a spot where I was raised and first seen the light of day at number 132 Eagle Street. Thanks be to God there was a Greenpoint. Thanks be to God that the light of day gave me my opportunity, and to the people of Greenpoint, I worked and worked the same as every other man and labored on the docks. I pulled lumber, I worked in the whole room business. I'm proud that I was a long shaman. I'm delighted to say that I work with men and I've done the same thing as every other man done, work for an honest living and thanks be to God for that. Thanks be to God As we stand here and look down historic Booth Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak for a second. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old, just two years more and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building, housing, a Borough President. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836 and then a depression set in. It lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years and then the building was finally erected in 1848. That's when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there on the right-hand side that old Arbuckle building that's coming down and we're going to build $11.5 million Kings County Supreme Court building. Then you go down a little further and we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building we're still going to keep there and we're going to renovate that and use it there. We're out of a car. Another one of the... Thanks a lot. We're here at Brooklyn at Borough Hall as we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look as we said before at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary.

When you go down a little further we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building we're still going to keep there and we're going to renovate that and use it for a federal court. This whole Brooklyn Civic Center is going to be flanked on both sides by public buildings and right in the center of it is going to be a war memorial and it's going to be a useful one instead of brick, lime, lumber and cement. It's going to be in honor of the 327,000 boys and girls who fought in this war. Don't forget Brooklyn supplied more in that 327,000 and he had 39 states in the Union. In this war memorial you're going to have an auditorium that holds 1,500 people and then you're going to have a room on the right where the trophies that our boys captured from the four corners of the world are going to be on display. Then on the left hand side is going to be a room in bronze where the names will be inscribed of every boy and girl who made the supreme sacrifice. And downstairs this is very interesting and I believe you'll like it. We're going to have a room for each of the veterans' organizations which isn't anywhere in the city of New York. We're going to have the American Legion, the King's County, the Spanish War veterans, the Catholic War veterans, the Jewish War veterans. They're all going to be down there in that one building. So as any of these 327,000 veterans need assistance, they'll have a central location point to which to go. Thank you. I appreciate you very much, Mr. President, your busy life stepping by this way and taking a few moments. That was quite a celebration you had down with Hamilton Ferry, wasn't it? You want to say a word about that? Yes, that was a big thrill. I'll tell you a little about that. A ferryboat, known as the Moran Thugboat Company, supplied it as a company. He lives in Brooklyn and he's a resident. I wonder if we can pick up somebody here, will you? I should say pick up, that's the wrong term. He says, how are you?
