New York City, someone said, is the home of the modern cliff dweller. Well, it is a fact that New Yorkers, by and large, live in rented apartments. But whether it's a cold-water one-and-a-half-room flat or a 12-room Park Avenue duplex, a New Yorker's home is still his castle. And that's because New York City, like most of the nation, enjoys rent control. As part of its public service programming, WNYC brings you a weekly discussion of the problems that arise under rent control. As usual, we have with us tonight our authority, Mr. Nathan W. Math, General Counsel to the City Rent Commission. Mr. Math. And that winds up another Monday evening of discussion about your city rent laws. Your guest expert, as usual, has been Mr. Nathan W.
