Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. New Yorkers have come to City Hall Park this evening to watch one of the town's Christmas time traditions, the lighting of the city Christmas trees. During this program, taking place on the steps of City Hall, you'll hear Mayor F.H. Lagardia's annual Christmas message to his fellow citizens. And after the mayor's address, his son Eric is scheduled to press the switch that will light the 22 Christmas trees in the parks in all the five boroughs, including the 40-foot tree in front of City Hall. And now we take you to the front of the City Hall steps where we hear a musical program by the New York City Police Department, Glee Club. The ball head, as I understand, is the bravesty in all the five boroughs, the ball head, as I understand, is the bravesty in all the five boroughs, The ball head, as I understand, is the bravesty in all the five boroughs, When the most be decked with the gate of the land, And also be a brave one before. 30 Mal. God belongs. The Lord hath provided this In honor of the King of Liz Which on this day it will be served in His very mercy on the earth From the lovely day of the King The Lord hath been Long before Now, ladies and gentlemen, we hear from Mr. William R. H. Latham, park engineer of the Department of Parks, who is representing Commissioner Moses. Annually, the Park Department takes pleasure in Giving the city 22 Christmas trees In different parks throughout the city In each of the five boroughs, there is a ceremony Such as this going on right now In each of the other four boroughs, The borough president is the principal speaker Of the ceremony. Here in Manhattan, we have two principal speakers. The first, I take pleasure in introducing Borough President Stanley Isaacs. Mr. Latham, fellow citizens, I am proud of the chance to Participate in this dignified ceremony Dedicating the Christmas tree in City Hall Park, Which will stand here as an emblem of beauty And of peace and goodwill. There are some who seem to think That we should not cut down our trees For these purposes, And they are so wrong. Our trees grow in the forests And they're used for many purposes. Some were cut down to form The lofty masts of ships In the older days. Some are cut down to furnish timber For our houses. Some have the most humble purpose Of being turned into pulp That makes paper To carry the spoken and the written word. But what loftier purpose Can be served By this beautiful tree That stands here Than to stand forth In City Hall Park As the emblem of our real civilization As that emblem of peace and goodwill That we need to show To the peoples of this city That we are a peaceful nation That our citizens from all lands Are here living peacefully together And that we breathe to the people Of all the world Peace and goodwill. Thank you, Mr. Isaacs.

O unser bestwiegere Greatly beaming with glowing hearts, by his cradle we stand. So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming, here came the wise men from. The Aryan land, the King of kings, lay thus in lowly manger, in all our trials born to be our friend. Cry of kings, O hear the angels' voices, O night divine. Cry of kings, O night, O night divine. Cry of kings, O night, O night divine. Cry of kings, O night divine. And the police department, Glee Club. And just at this moment, ladies and gentlemen, from the 40-foot tree across the park, there appeared a vision. It's Santa Claus. And the park department band at the foot of the Christmas tree playing Jingle Bells. We return you now to our studios in the municipal building. Go anywhere. Give me waiting. No. No. No.
