When you walk by a war bond, remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the boys overseas are giving their lives. You are only asked to lend your money. And on this theme, your city station microphones are set up at 29th Street and 7th Avenue on the southwest corner to bring you the ceremonies of the war bond rally of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry. Among the notable speakers to be heard will include our own mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Fiorello H. Ligardia. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Henry H. Engel, who is chairman of this rally. Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a privilege to present a great singing star who has graciously consented to be with us at this monster war bond rally. She has sung with the Metropolitan Opera Company, the San Francisco Opera Company, and is now one of the stars of that smash hit operetta, Rosalinda. It gives me great pleasure to present Miss Jean Merrill, who will sing our national anthem. hip-k네-ittäin in the起 when heều is named safe. Miss Jean Merrill, who rings where most of the systems of the// Through the air of the night The rain we watched As the planet is turning On the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gain proof through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say, God, God, God, God And who is there And the fire and the fire And the love of him Thank you, Miss Merrill. And now, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of this rally, I wish to present the chairman of the War Bond Committee of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry, Mr. George I. Fox. Thank you, Miss Merrill. Thank you, Miss Merrill. Ladies and gentlemen of the Fur Industry, I welcome you as chairman of the Bond Committee of the Fur Industry to this rally, which marks the opening of the greatest drive that the nation has attempted to raise a huge sum of $13 billion for the support of our boys in the field. The fur trade has pledged itself to participate to the extent of $10 million in bond stores this drive. I'm sure that every one of us, both employers and employees alike, will do their share in participating in this privilege, to share in the fight for freedom, democracy, and until victory is ours. I know the fur trade will all to a man. Come along and not wait to be approached and coached to participate in this privilege. You'll come along from your own free will and buy bonds as much as you can so that we can share in the effort until the Nazis and the fascists have been wiped off the earth. We have a very elaborate program prepared for you. We have some nationally known singers and some well-known speakers, among whom our very beloved mayor, the Honorable Fiorello Lagaria, will speak to you in a little while. And now I'm going to introduce to you the young man who will take over to this master of ceremonies on this occasion, a man who is a nationally known artist, both on stage and screen, who has just come back from the coast where he has entertained 195 camps. He is also appearing on the Campbell's program each Wednesday night. He is the star of the Siegfeld Follies. He's a man who gives of himself at all times that he's ever called upon to perform a duty for patriotic services and for very charitable causes. I give you the very fast-approaching number one comedian of the United States, our very beloved Milton Berle. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Fox, it's a wonderful announcement for a skin dealer. I'm very glad to be here today, ladies and gentlemen, on this wonderful rally. It's very nice and warm out here. I should have worn my silver-fuck earmuffs today. But I want to tell you... Pardon me, I just got up. It's a pleasure and a privilege, really. On behalf of the fur industry, and I'd like to be half of the fur industry, it's really a thrill to be up here on this rostrum with all these... I guess all you ladies and gentlemen in this very vast audience are wondering who these very, very gorgeous-looking ladies are here with the roses in their hands. May I say that these ladies, I'd like to introduce them, have them stand up and take a bow. They're all mothers of all the boys from the fur industry that are seeing service. Let's give them a swell hand. Here they are. Thank you very much, ladies. Thank you. You look very, very pretty. Very. I want to tell you that everybody's going to be here. The mayor, Mayor LaGuardia, was supposed to be here a little earlier, but he's tied up. He's playing bingo up in 48th Street, you see. If he's here, I'm kidding, Fiorella. But I have... Everybody, in fact, you know, the reason I'm here, for another reason, I'm very, very glad to be... I have a brother. Mr. Fox, you can sit down. We saw your coat. Looks all right. Looks... He gets up and shows his coat. And, uh... Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf? I.J. Fox. I, um... No, pardon me. I mean George Fox. But it is really... My brother's in the fur industry. He's a caracal curler. Got a wonderful job. You know how you can curl caracal. They're curled already. Do I have to explain the jokes here today? But I want to tell you, it's really very, very... A big thrill, ladies and gentlemen, really, to be up in this bar. There is very... In fact, Eleanor Roosevelt was supposed to be here, but it was too near. And, uh... I'm a little tired out. I've been ironing all day and forging my ration card. And I want to tell you, it, uh... This is like trying to get laughs in a murder trial. Will you relax? Laugh and the world laughs with you. Try and they put you on a good will. I want to tell you... It's very, very difficult trying to get laughs with the subway going underneath you here. But I want to tell you that I would like to introduce... I would like. I would like to go back to sleep. I would like to introduce... I'm really... I'm tired, really. I'm very happy, though, today. It's my anniversary. I've been married a year today. I don't know what to get my wife. She wants a man. I, uh... Oh, now you laugh. I like that our New York Finest, all these very fine policemen, are doing a wonderful job here this afternoon. I think a swell hand for the New York's Finest boys. Let's give all the boys a hand. Except the guy up on 34th Street wouldn't let me through. And if he can hear me, I mean it. He's a... He's a Harvard man. And, uh... No, all kidding aside, all these fellas... I played a cop in my last picture. I made a picture called Margin for Error. Who saw the picture? Anybody see it? Three, four, five. Thank you. You did. Hello, Ben. I'm glad to see you. Ben Platt's here. I guess he wants me to mention his name. I mentioned it. Now you go back to your store. All right. I played a cop in that picture, and I had the most important part in that picture in Margin for Error. Joan Bennett, she's in the picture, too. And I have the most important part. At the beginning of the picture, I opened the door and let Joan Bennett in the picture. And if I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. That's the end of the joke. What do you want? Gasoline? Relax. May I present... May I present as our first surprise, ladies and gentlemen... May I present as our first surprise, some kids from CCNY waving to me over there. How are you, kid? Fine. How are you? Playing hooky, huh? May I present four boys, ladies and gentlemen, that are from our very fine United States Coast Guard. All of them have seen action and fighting. One gentleman who was the head of the Southerners, Mr. Homer Smith. You've heard on the Columbia Broadcasting System, and he's gathered all these boys and formed the Coast Guard Quartet, which is one of the finest singing quartets in the service. Now, the fellow members of the quartet are Ms. James Lewis, Thomas Lockhart, Martin Bowen, with Frank Boyle at the piano. Now, Homer, suppose you take over and tell him what we're going to do. Where is Homer? All right, Homer. Homer, our ladies and gentlemen, Homer Smith. A swell hand for Homer Smith. Thank you. Oh, yeah, I know you, Homer. How are you doing? All right. This wasn't the same spot for you out there at Manhattan Beach. We'll wait for you. Yeah, we're out at Manhattan Beach together. We did that big benefit out there. That was the opening. I remember very well. Okay. Well, these boys are dynamite. Yes, yes. Semper Varadus, ladies and gentlemen. Semper Varadus is our guy, our fame of glory too. To fly to save or fight and die. I'm close, God, we are for you. From north and south and east and west, the coast starts in the height. Chasing ships and landing boats. The axis feels a might. The coast that landed everywhere in all our fighting fields. In hattling shore and trapping shore, you'll find a silver shield. So here's Puzgat-Benzong, we fight on land or sea. Through our land and gale, and shock and shell to win our victory. For the coast guard, we are for you. I close, God, we are for you. Yeah. You want to sing another one? I want you to listen to the coast guard's next song, and if you like it, I'll tell you who wrote it. And if you don't like it, I'll never write another song as long as I live. Thank you. Keep the home fires burning while the hearts are yearning. Though the lands be far away, they dream of home. There's a silver lining through the dark clouds shining. Turn the dark clouds inside out till the boys come home. There's a long, long trail a-winding until my dreams all come true. Till the day when I'll be going down that long, long trail with you. We're on our way, glory laying down. It's a long way to Tipperary. It's a long way to Tipperary. The sweetest girl in all the world to me. So goodbye to Pinkadilly. And farewell, Esther, swear. It's a long, long way to Tipperary. But my heart's right there. Nights are all Send you away. Send you away. I think about you all through the day. My body, ooh. My body, ooh. My body, ooh. Nobody quite so true. Nobody quite so true. Miss your voice, the touch of your hand. I long to know that you understand my body, ooh. My body, ooh. Your body, Mr. Moon. Your body, Mr. Moon. B زie الإ AMERICAN PITRAIN PITRAIN Over there Over there Oh, over there Thank you. Yes, sir. Wonderful, wonderful. Come on, let's give him a big hand. The Coast Guard Quartet. Boy, look at that. God bless you, boys. Well, it just goes to show you, ladies and gentlemen, that what a land of democracy and freedom that we're living in, where we can have four boys to come up here and sing right from the bottom of their heart and really mean everything and really mean it all. Thank you, boys. You were really wonderful. God bless you. I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, quiet back there, please. Thank you. Wonderful orchestra, really. They love music. They sleep music. They eat music. If they can only read music, that's it. I'm only kidding. If I said anything to insult you, I thank you. I would like, ladies and gentlemen, to introduce to you a young lady. When I say a young lady, I really mean it because she's a very, very beautiful young lady, and she's a grand star in her own right. She's a grand 20th Century Fox star. Incidentally, I'm under contract with them, and I just signed a 10-year contract with them, and next week they're going to let me read it. This young lady has been doing such a wonderful job in all the camps and Navy bases and everything, and her very swell and grand husband, who is in the Navy right now, in the Marines. I'm sorry. Pardon me. Well, all right. Thank you. Well, what's the difference? Thank you for correcting me. He's in the Marines, and oh, boy, and he's doing his part, and he's doing a great job. May I present to you Annabella, Mrs. Tyrone Powell, ladies and gentlemen. I'm awfully sorry about that. I'm sorry about the Marines. Oh, darling. Ladies and gentlemen, I have to make a confession first, as you'll be able to realize very soon I'm awfully bad to make speeches. So this morning, they gave me that, to read to you. And on the way over in the car, I tried, and I found out that I was as bad to read it as to try to make it by myself. So, if you don't mind, I'll try in my own words to tell you what I feel. And if my accent is not very good, and if I don't always use the right word, I want you to know that, at least, it comes from the bottom of my heart. I'm an American citizen now, and I'm very proud of it. I'm married to an American citizen. You know who he is, and I'm very proud of it, too. But I was born in France, in Paris, and coming from Europe, as I suppose many of you did, and you have some of your family and some of your parents over there, you know all how much they are waiting for the American soldiers to arrive. So what we are going to try to do today, and every day, is to try to hurry that day of freedom for all those poor countries over there. And for that, we need more guns, and more tanks, and more planes, and for that, we need every penny we can give. because a little while ago, 15 or 16 months ago, we were asked to buy defense bonds. And that was wonderful. We had to defend ourselves, and we wanted to fight, and we were hoping to win. But today, what you are asked for is even more exciting, because today, we know we are going to win. But we want to win quickly. And if you can remember that maybe each time you are going to give a dollar, each time you are going to buy a bond, it's going to bring peace nearer to us. Maybe it's going to save an hour, or one minute. So, if you think of that, when you are going to give the dollar, don't wait an hour. Don't wait a minute. Don't wait a second. But please, please, do it now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Annabella. Thank you. Lots of good luck. Tomorrow gots to tie. After all, what has Tyrone Powell got that I haven't got? I'm sorry to say. But, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure now to present to you, at this time, a gentleman chairman, who is the chairman of the War Emergency Board of the fur industry, who discusses the records of the War Emergency Board. May I present to you, the chairman, Mr. Lou White. Here he is, Mr. Lou White. Ladies and gentlemen, my friends have often told me that I look 10 years younger with my hat on. And, uh, I'm sure that I'll feel at least 20 degrees warmer if I can keep my hat on. Oh, pardon me, Mr. White, may I interrupt? Were you caught in the hair raid? If I had the humor that our friend Mr. Burl has here, I could answer him. But if you also had my hair, it would be all right. The War Emergency Board of the fur industry, composed of labor and management organizations in the industry, has done an outstanding job in its war effort activities. It has sponsored the previous war bond drive, the salvage drive, the blood donors drive, and through its war chest, recently distributed $250,000 to war relief agencies of the Allied nations. The board's greatest gesture was the creation of the fur vest project, which is now of national scope and operation. Thousands of fur-lined vests have been distributed to brave merchant seamen of the Allied Merchant Marine and this project is to be continued indefinitely to ensure a steady flow of these vests for the duration of the war. This project was made possible through the patriotism and generosity of the fur workers. Many of you, within the hearing of my voice, are giving unstintingly of your time and labor for this most worthy cause, and I'm sure you'll continue to do so. We are here today to ask you to make another contribution, but one which will not require your time or even effort. The United States government is asking you to put your money into the finest and safest investment in the world. Not only will you receive a good rate of interest and ensure yourself against poverty and distress in the years to come, but these bonds will pay big dividends in victory, freedom, and the peaceful pursuit of happiness. Bring those boys over there back quicker by backing them up with your dollars over here. And now it is my extreme pleasure to present to you a dynamic personality, a real friend of the fur industry, a man who has been untiring in his duty and devotion to his country and his city. His honor, the mayor of New York, Fiorella LaGuardia. Mr. Chairman, Benny, who said this was a ghost town? I wish some of these employers were trying to bring back starvation wages and the sweatshops and Macy's and Bloomingdale's and Abraham and Strauss could come here and see this ground. And incidentally, while we're fighting this war, we are not going to permit labor standards to be brought down. Now let Bloomingdale and Macy and Abraham and Strauss and Lord and Taylor take note of that and perhaps look at their own payrolls and give their employees a better birth. You know, Ben Gold asked me to come here to make an appeal for this second war loan and after he asked me to come here and make the appeal, he just now told me you're oversubscribed already. And of course, I know that the fur industry will come through as they always do. You know, as I said last night at Carnegie Hall, the matter is very simple. We either loan the money to our government and get it back with interest or else Hitler and the Japs will come over here and take it away from us. We get nothing back. And we're not going to let them come over here. And that is why we want to make this second war loan not only successful, we want to oversubscribe it. and I am sure that the flourishing, prospering, great industrial town of New York will lead the whole procession. Now, of course, we have no illusions about this, men. It's going to be a long and difficult war. There's no doubt as to the outcome, but we must do a complete job. And that means that there is a great deal of hard and difficult fighting ahead. The news this week is rather encouraging. The French, the British, and our American troops are chasing Rommel and his army into the waters of the Bay of Tunis. The army of the Soviet Republicans are pushing back every attempt of the Nazi forces to break through again. The Russian army has now the Nazi army in the mud up to their knees and pretty soon they'll have them in the mud up to their necks. It wasn't so many weeks ago when Hitler was making preparations for his march into Moscow. And as I told you at the meeting Madison Square Garden, the only time the Nazi army will see Moscow will be when they'll be taken there as prisoners of war. the Nazi army will be when they will be in the mud. And yet, as I say, there's a great deal more fighting to be done. And we have to fight until we've beaten and crushed and destroyed the Japs, Hitler, and his little pal Mussolini too. None of them are any good and never were any good. And some of us knew that they were no good all of the time. So I want to congratulate the fur industry of New York City, employers, and the organized workers of the fur industry in getting an early start in this war loan in setting the example to other industries. And I know that you'll make good for your country this time as you always make good. This war is not only for our protection, it's for a better world to bring about the assurance of peace and economic security not only for our people but for the people of the entire world. Thank you. Thank you. Honorable Bear, the glory of Earth. It was really a wonderful, wonderful speech. I know the little flower so well I call him Bud. I am. Never forget the time I landed in California and I came in on a plane and I landed at LaGuardia Airport right on the brim of his hat. But I do want to tell you incidentally I'm wearing an Adam's hat myself. Looks like Adam wore it. But I do look, he's rehearsing there again. Thank you. Now you'll get a chance really to play that music. They've been rehearsing there for about 15 minutes. May I introduce now once again the little lady that sang our national anthem at the beginning of the show and she's going to do a little song for herself. And for you lovely ladies and gentlemen may I present to you the star the singing star Rosalinda Miss Jean Merrill. Let's give her a swell reception. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Lovely. Thank you. Lovely. Thank you very much. So long, Mayor LaGuardia. Honorable Mayor LaGuardia. Thank you very much. I want to tell you I I'm only kidding, Mayor. You know you know I just goes to show you now Fiorello who just walked off the stage did you see him smile? It goes to show you when you take a man like the Honorable Mayor LaGuardia when he can smile and we can say what we want to a man like the mayor when we say what we want to the president we must be living in a land of freedom and democracy and I really mean that sincerely ladies and gentlemen. I would like I would like to introduce I would like to introduce a gentleman who's been doing his utmost and been doing a sensational job toward the war effort he he has a very marvelous position in the Treasury Department and he's going to say a few words. May I present to you Mr. Mitchell of the Treasury Department ladies and gentlemen. Thank you Mr. Pearl I'm not going to talk to you about bonds I know as the mayor said that you people will assume your obligation what I want to talk to you about is what you are going to think during this bond drive and it's been said far better than I could tell you a long time ago by Thomas Paine he wrote it at the time of the revolution when we at that time also had a crisis this is what he said these are the times that try men's souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men and women tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of the conflict the more glorious the triumph I call upon not a few but upon all not on this state or that state but upon every state and up and help us lay your shoulder to the wheel better to have too much force than too little when so much is at stake it matters not where you live or what rank of life you hold the evil or the blessing will reach you all the far and the near the home country and the back the rich and the poor will resurfer and rejoice alike the heart that does not feel now is dead the blood of his children will curse his cowardice who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved the whole ask yourself just one question will you be proud of your boys when they come home of course you will now ask yourself another will they be proud of you you know the answer you're going to make them proud of you and I want to present one of the boys that we can be justly proud of a man who has seen action on practically all the fighting fronts a man who has done his work as we shall do ours from the Coast Guard Mr. Joe Press the boys out there are doing a good job I've seen them and I've seen them die by the guns so all I can say is they're out there giving the Japanese the Italian and the Germans hell and all I can say is you just can give the bonds hell and get the guns over there thank you thank you Joe grand looking boy and thank you Mr. Frank Mitchell of the Treasury Department and now ladies and gentlemen being that Joe Chris is one of the United States Coast Guard I think it's just proper once again through numerous requests to have the Coast Guard quartet sing another song Chris how about it one more song from the Coast Guard are you all ready boys well that was a solid this is my America that's what we're going to sing this is our America let's go you ready for this is my America land of liberty for this is my America where all men are free so let us raise each voice in praise to our God of love he gave us all America the land we'll always love we thank thee for America the land that we'll always adore and love from valors and plains America grew this beloved America Washington knew our America stretching from coast to coast has given a heritage we proudly boast we stand ready to defend our land and we want the enemy to understand and they cannot stop us no matter how hard they try we will fight for our America and if need be we'll die with taps we now wish to offer a tribute our honor heroes we reverently salute the land we reverently salute thank you Coast Guard Quartet thank you you're really wonderful and now I think it's time that I'm going to retire ladies and gentlemen as you master ceremonies and turn this program over to one whom you all know and I think and I believe and I'm sure you respect he's a business manager at the Furrier's Joint Council he is one of the most elegant voices of labor he's been in a large measure responsible for the success of this rally and his associates in the union have given their time and energy in the handling of arrangement may I present to

and the American workers can produce the best ships the best trains the best tanks and guns to their sons and the sons of millions more to put an end to Hitlerism to put an end to slavery to bring about the world free of the threats free of the slavery imposed by Hitler and the conquered people to bring about a better and freer world for all of us these are the mothers here who have sent their sons for that purpose last night the Secretary of the Treasurer Mr. Morgan Dow spoke at Carnegie Hall and his opening remarks when he opened the speech he said the second friend is no military secret we all know that just over the horizon we of the United Nations are piling up the thunderclouds of the greatest attack in history now we are ready to deal a few blows ourselves and there will be blows that I can promise that will rock Nazi Germany to a rotten bloodstained foundation the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States government the cabinet member of our government opened the speech last night with a statement that we are ready and this second war bond drive is raised in order to make possible the invasion of Europe in order to make possible the joining of hands of our brave American boys of the heroic boys of the British Army with the heroic people and army of the Soviet Union in one mighty invasion of Europe that will once and for all put an end to Hitlerism and his slavery and it is these bonds that we made you to buy today that will give the answer of the firm workers to the American government that we will give and give and give in every way possible to make possible the realization of the invasion of Europe to make possible victory over Hitlerism in 1943 and now it is my job and present job to introduce to you the next and last speaker one who has inspired and led our union with its 80,000 members to fight in the front of the war activities that is a shining example for the entire labor movement in this country one who is the inspirer of 7,000 members of our union who are today in the armed forces and who inspires these 7,000 members to fight in the front ranks of the American armed forces and who will give an account of themselves in the same manner and even more ironically and even with greater sacrifice than the membership of our union that has stayed behind to support them on this side it gives me pleasure to introduce to you the president of the International Foreigner Workers Union Ben Goh Friends since that we are bound to enter a new very important and perhaps decisive phase of this great tragedy of mankind it seems that a great many developments will take place in the year of 1943 it seems that a great many battles will take place in the very near future and every battle will bring closer the day when all of us and the entire civilized world will gather to celebrate the great moment of the collapse of the Nazi cannibals and the victory of the civilized world tables are definitely turning slowly but surely not long ago Hitler and his chiefs were bragging about the superiority of the German weapons today it is generally recognized that our country alone succeeded in outproducing the Nazis to the decree that even the Nazis recognized this fact both in quality and quantity our weapons are superior to the Nazis murderous weapons not long ago the entire world was trembling with fear at the trap of Hitler that is going to continue bombing London to a shambles today this situation is entirely different our liberators and fortresses and the spitfires and the Russian sturmuriks are bombing Germany without a stop and he feels the taste of his blitzkrieg methods not long ago Churchill in his speech stated to the British people that the only thing that he can offer them is sweat and tears and blood today Hitler and Gables and Geryx sing that song and they talk to the German people of blood and tears and sweat not long ago all of us were afraid that Hitler might carry out his threat to invade the British army today there is a great deal of talk about invasion but the invasion of the United Nations and the European continent that will catch Hitler and our most brutal milkcracker in the history of military matters on the one site our boys and our British boys on the other side the glorious red army that will split the army and annihilate it until the Casablanca decision of unconditional surrender will become a fact until recently Hitler kept on talking of speedy victory now in our ranks that fought in of speedy victory we are done interested in that victory come as soon as possible we can afford to prevent this war too long it is no war that great invincible Nazi cannibal army that threatened the entire world coming in as the liberi on the Soviet Russian battlefields will never fight again on the side of the Nazis in order to carry through the great fight of mankind we must make every effort to help our government help the armed forces of the United Nations to make that possible and we gather today publicly and officially to reassure our decision and make it clear that we are ready and willing and eager to back up that decision by action now we are opening the great campaign for 13 billion bonds and the workers who hate fascism who hate reaction who despise oppression who are always on the job to fight for democracy and freedom and the rights of labor and the well-being of our nation are called today to make the opening the international union intends to develop an intensive campaign to contribute 2 million dollars to this fund to buy bonds I ask is there a bullshit to instruct the general executive board to develop the campaign among its members for 2 million dollars in this month is there a motion to that effect is there any seconder to the motion regularly moved and seconded to instruct and empower the general executive board of the international union to develop the campaign for 2 million dollars war bonds all in favor signify raising your hand and keep it up keep it up keep it up let's have a picture so that we can see it whether there is a unanimous decision hold it hold it hold it beat marks now done and the opposed raise your hand and this is the unanimous decision that we again serve notice of the cannabis and the appeasers and the agents of it that we are ready to fight to the last trap of blood to annihilate the Nazis for the victory of the civilized world at this time may I ask you to take your heads off I introduce and ladies and gentlemen with this unanimous decision of the fur industry to back the second war loan of the United States
