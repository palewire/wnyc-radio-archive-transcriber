This is John Blondell speaking. I have an important message for all Americans, especially for you who have friends and relatives behind the Iron Curtain in Europe. My message is about Easter, the resurrection of Christ. Here in America, we may worship on Easter morning where we please and how we please. Those who live under the godless oppression of Soviet Russia are far less fortunate. Religion is denied them, but you can remind them of the holy season of Easter and help to strengthen their hope in the return of religious freedom. So send an Easter greeting, a card, a letter, or a message to your friends and relatives abroad. Let them know there is religious freedom here and that they must continue to fight for it there. Mail an Easter card today, and if you want further information, write to me or to Letters from America, 20 West 40th Street, New York City, 18 New York. Let's make it a joyful Easter again for the whole world. April 6, 2022. We have another round of green famous European democracy. You can do this in the back of the Easter as a child.
