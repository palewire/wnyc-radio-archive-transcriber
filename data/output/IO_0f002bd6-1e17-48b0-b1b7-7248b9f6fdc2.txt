A spiritual is just sung by the choristers. And now from Gershwin's Forgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Bore, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I got no car, got no mule, I got no misery. The folks with dead people at me, got a lock on the door. Pray somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in' war. What for? What for? What for? What for? I got a lock on the door, that's the way to be. They can feel the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got my gal, got my tongue, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my dog. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got the sun, got the moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of money, got the great old days. I'm plenty, you don't have to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, getting the time to ride. Never want to be long as I'm well. Never want to strive to be gone, to be bad. You're going to be dead, what the hell are you glad I'm alive? Oh, I'm not worthy of nothing, and nothing's like me for me. I got my gals, got my gals, for heaven's all day long. Now you complain it! Got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've Got Plenty of Nothing from Gershwin's Forgy and Betts. The choristers are under the direction of Florence Martirosian, with Isabelle LeBori as piano accompanist. What did you say, 1982? It's an hour, two years and a three years? Thank you. Thank you.
