This is a Christmas story. A Christmas story that began in New York and came to an end an ocean away. For though the threads of this story were first gathered together in New York, the warm pattern of it was woven and finally completed in a little village in Holland. The story began with a plan. It was a foster parents' plan for war children. And gently it asked bountiful Americans to lend a helping dollar or two to the hordes of parentless children in Europe. That's what the plan asked. And one day in New York, when a young American wife answered the call, the threads of this Christmas tale began to gather. I'm awfully glad that I've done this, Mr. Wilcox. Oh, you should be proud, Mrs. Swift. Why, you couldn't do much more for this little girl if you were her own mother. I almost feel as if she were my child. And I think she'll feel that way too, when you begin writing to each other. Oh, that'll be nice. I want to know everything about the little girl. I mean all of the things that your report can't tell me. Oh, like what kind of games she likes. Not what terrible things she saw. You know what I mean. Yes, yes, of course. And I would like to send her something for Christmas. I mean something besides the allowance I've agreed to send. Yes, she would enjoy that. Kids like Clara Vogel have never really had a Christmas. For most of those young ones, war has even destroyed their belief in Santa Claus. Well, maybe I can convince little Clara that there is a Santa Claus. Clara would call him San Nicolas. San Nicolas. San Nicolas. Yes, Clara would call him San Nicolas. That is, she would call him San Nicolas if she believed in him. But when you've heard the German bombs screaming in Rotterdam, seen them rob you of your parents, when you've been pushed out into a hostile world alone as this little Dutch girl was, it's hard for you to ever believe again. Even later when the Allies came with peace, and though they comforted Clara and finally reunited her with her relatives, it was still hard for her to forget and harder for her to believe. Even now in the village of North Rabin, Holland, in a little brick cottage as Clara sits before a fire with her grandparents, it's hard to forget something, and harder for her to believe in other things. Like San Nicolas, for instance. Yes, little Clara, this time of year is a happy time. Why, Grandpapa? Because it is the time of Christmas and of San Nicolas. The fire always feels better on my hands at this time of year. I'm not sure that I believe in San Nicolas, Grandpapa. Is there really a San Nicolas? Ask your Grandmama, she is a very wise woman. Is there a San Nicolas, Grandmama? Oh, yes, little Clara. But he never visited me before. How can they be a great time? Because it is really a great time, and this time of year is a happyï¿½, And this time of year is a happy time. Why, Grandpapa? Because it is the time of Christmas and of San Nicolas. The fire always feels better on my hands at this time of year. I'm not sure that I believe in San Nicolas, Grandpapa. Is there really a San Nicolas? Ask your grandmama. She is a very wise woman. Is there a San Nicolas, Grandmama? Oh, yes, little Clara. But he never visited me before. How can I be a San Nicolas if he never found me and never brought me any presents? You grew up in the bad years for San Nicolas. During the years of the war, San Nicolas lost many addresses. How is this possible, Grandmama? You see, little Clara, a bit of San Nicolas, the spirit of San Nicolas. Is it each one of us who love you? And during the war, even we who love you did not know where you were. So San Nicolas did not know where to deliver your presents. Oh, Grandmama, is this really true? What do you think, little one? I don't know. I would like to believe, but I don't know. Then we will prove it. We will test San Nicolas. Oh, I would like that, Grandmama. This year, your loved ones and San Nicolas know where you are. So all we have to know is what you want. Yes, that should prove it. Now tell us, what is it you want, little Clara? I would like San Nicolas to bring me a doll. A real doll. A doll, is it? Oh, yes, a wonderful, pretty doll. Then no doubt. That is what San Nicolas will bring you. Oh, Grandmama, do you really think so? I certainly do. Oh, now, little one, it is getting late. Kiss both your grandpapa and me and go to bed. Yes, Grandmama. Good night, Grandmama. Good night, little one. Good night, grandpapa. Good night, little one. Oh, I would like a doll very much. Maybe. Maybe there is a San Nicolas. Good night, Grandmama. Good night, grandpapa. Good night, dear. Oh, what a wise woman you are, Mama. You think so, Papa. Yes, but where, Mama, are you going to get the money to buy the little one a doll? Well, we barely manage. We have no wealth with our little farm. We have savings. Oh, oh, no, Mama. No, those seven guilders are saved to buy a little pig. Now, Papa, which is more important? To buy a pig or the happiness of little Clara? She's pagar Oh, gets this covered under Feuer? CLARA Yeah, you pour a little wur. But Papa, and I use it by Douglas. You might be sure she has a doll available. But Mama, when you sold your stock of conflicts for three guilders and I put her to the seven, You win, Mama. Then we shall buy Clara a nice little fat doll. You are a very wise woman, Mama. Thank you, Papa. Maybe Sir Nicholas will bring you a little pig. Oh, Mama, I'm a bit too old to believe in fairy tales. But you are a very wise woman, Mama. Very wise. So Grandmother Vogel sold her stock of cheeses, and with the three guilders put to the seven, there was the promise of a wonderful doll for little Clara. Her first doll. Her only doll. And one night, when their neighbor, Gustav, visited them, Grandfather Vogel even joked about the little pig that he had hastily promised to buy. And Gustav, who was to travel to Rotterdam, promised to take their money with him and bring back a wonderful doll for Clara. It was a sacred trust, and even Gustav was really happy that the money was to be spent not on the pig, but on a doll. But he joked and joked about it anyway. Everything seemed wonderful. But sometimes the threads in even a simple pattern go astray and get tangled. And sometimes this even happens with a simple story. Yeah, yeah, Grandfather Vogel, I think you would have liked Hans. Who is Hans Gustav? Hans is the little pig I was going to sell you. Is he round and fat? Yeah, he's round and fat. Oh, how nice to have a nice little fat pig. Now, Papa, which is more important? Oh, the doll, of course. I was only joking with Gustav. How happy a doll will make Clara, yeah. Yes, and it will make us happy to watch her smiling when she first sees it. Yes, that will be nice. Yes, I sure would like to see her face when she opens the package. You will, Gustav, you will. Well, good neighbors, I must be going. What? Gustav? I have to go. You almost forgot the money. Oh, my. It isn't often that Gustav Don forgets his money, huh? I must have been thinking about the doll. We are all thinking of the doll, Gustav. Bring back a wonderful one for Clara. Now, Mama, give Gustav the money. Oh, yes, here is the money. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Ten gold is what a wonderful doll. Don't worry, Grandma, for you. You should, isn't I? I'll bring the best doll that is to be had, huh? When should we expect you to stop? I'll be back exactly on Christmas Eve. Just in time for San Nicolas. Wonderful, wonderful. I must be honest. Now, don't worry. I'll bring back the biggest and the best doll. Oh, what a man that Gustav is. He loves his pigs so much that he gives them names. Don't laugh, Papa. I think you are as fond of his pigs as he is. Oh, maybe, Mama. Maybe. Ah, the fire is good this Christmas Eve. But Gustav is slow. Be patient, Papa. Gustav will be here any time now. I feel too young to be patient tonight. Christmas makes all of us feel young. Yes, I guess so. Now I think I will go out to meet Gustav. He should be on the road by now. If you don't want the cold spirits to bite your nose off, Papa, you'd better take your heavy coat. Bah, you and your fairy tales, Mama. Goodbye, Mama. Now I go to bring back Gustav and the prettiest doll in Europe. I almost feel like San Nikolov. Ah, he should be at the turn of the road by now. Ah, I see a figure. It must be him. Gustav! Gustav, is that you? Yes, yes. Is that you, Grandpa Vogel? Yes, Gustav. Oh, Gustav, how good it is to see you. Thank you, Grandpa Vogel. Thank you. Now, where is the wonderful doll? I went to all the best dolls in Rotterdam. That is good, Gustav. Now, where is the doll? Ah, there is no doll. What? You must be joking with me, Gustav. No, no, no. I'm afraid not. No doll. No? No. For the ten guilders, or for the ten more that I would add, there are no dolls in Europe such as us. I am sorry. Very sorry. I'm afraid little Clara will be very sorry to you. But, I have something else. Well, look, the mailman asked me to deliver this package. He's from America, Grandpa Vogel. America. Thank you, Gustav. These people of America are very kind to little Clara, giving her food and clothes. Very kind. But the doll, she will miss the doll. Yeah, I'm sorry. Very sorry. Oh, Clara. Oh, little Clara. No dolls in Europe. No dolls. Well, it is home. I never thought I would come back without Clara's doll. Welcome, Papa. Welcome. What a wonderful package you carried. Mama. This is not the package. The package we hoped for. What do you mean? Gustav found no doll, Mama. There are no dolls in Europe. No dolls for little girls such as Clara. No dolls? No dolls. Then, what is the package you hold, Papa? This, Mama? This is another package from the kind Americans to little Clara. No doubt they send more good food and clothes for our little one. Oh, we should be very thankful for such kindness, Papa. But the doll, Mama. How she will miss the doll. Poor Clara. She will miss it very much. Where is little Clara now? She's in the other room. I think she comes now. Please, Mama. You explain about the doll. I cannot. Oh, Grandpapa and Grandmama. I see it. I see the package. You can't hide it, Grandpapa. I see it, and I know what it is. Oh, little Clara. It may not be what you want. Oh, I know it is the doll. Now, let me have it. And may I open it? Before you open it, Clara, will you kiss your grandfather and promise to love him and your Grandmama in spite of everything? Oh, I do love you and Grandmama very much. And I love St. Nicholas, too. Now may I have the package? Yes. Oh, Grandpapa. Grandmama. It is beautiful. A beautiful doll. What? What? Let me see, Clara. Let me see. Here, Grandpapa. Here. Oh, Clara. Clara, I'm so happy. The doll is so beautiful. Oh, Grandpapa. This is so wonderful. And I love St. Nicholas so much. Now I believe in him, Grandpapa. And I will always love him and believe in him. That is right, little Clara. Did you hear that, Mama? Mama? Clara, where did your Grandmama go? I thought you noticed, Grandpapa. When she saw the doll, she began to cry and then she went outside. Oh, what a woman. Such things make her cry. But now I must bring her back here. Mama? Mama, where are you? Here, Papa. Here, Papa. I just went to visit Gustav with our ten idle builders. And I come back with a friend for you. Oh, Mama, Mama. It is a pig that you bring. Oh, what a nice little fat pig. Bring him in. Bring him in, Mama. Mama. The very next morning, bright and early, Peter and his mother were out shopping. Soon they came to the store where Golden Star was hanging with the other stars. They opened the door and entered. Oh, there he is. That's him. That's him. Oh, he's the heart to whom I belong. Oh, if he only looked this way and see me, then I know he would take me with him. Oh, he's not even looking here. Well, let's see now. I think we have presents for everyone. There's a train for Tom and a doll for Betty and the music box for Jane and the rocking horse and the sled. Yes, that's just about everything. Oh, Mother. Mother, I see it. My star. It's my star. Just like you said. Oh, Mother, let me take it with me. Oh, Peter. It's just a little golden star for the tree. Why, that's not the kind of star I was speaking of at all. Oh, but I am a real star. If only I could let her know that I belong to Peter. Oh, I do hope she'll let him take me. Boy, he knows that I belong to him, too. Oh, please let me have this one, Mother. Even though it's much smaller than the star we have for the tree now, I'd much rather have this one. Please, Mother. Oh, all right, dear. All right, Miss. I'll take that star, too. And so the star was taken down from the place where it hung and wrapped up in a piece of paper. And all the while it thrilled with joy. For now it belonged to the little boy. It was not until the afternoon before Christmas, when the tree was being decorated, that the golden star was unwrapped and taken out from the paper. Here, Dad, is the little star that Peter took such a fancy to. Oh, now we must hang this on the tree. All right. We'll hang it here on the very top. That evening, all the candles were lighted on the Christmas tree, and there were so many that they fairly dazzled the eyes. There were gold and red and silver balls and fairies and all kinds of glass fruits. There were large peppermint sticks, too, and shiny tinsel all around the tree. Everything shone and twinkled in the lights. And way up on top, high above them all, shone the golden star. And at seven o'clock, a bell was rung, and then the folding doors of the room where the Christmas tree stood were thrown open, and a crowd of children came running in. This was also very different from the great wide still sky house, and the golden star was not used to it at all. But she was happier than she had ever been in her whole life, for her little boy was there. Little Peter stood apart from the other children, looking up at the star with his hands clasped behind him, and he did not seem to care for the toys and the games. At last, it was all over. Good night. Merry Christmas. Watch out for the show. It's very good. Good night. Good night. The lights were put out and the shades were drawn. Everything in the house grew still. Then, for the first time, the beautiful ornaments on the tree began talking among themselves. Well, that's all over. It was very gay this evening. The gayest Christmas I remember. That's right, and you were very pretty, Silver Ball. You looked even prettier than last year, even shinier. Why, thank you, Red Ball. I thought you were very pretty, too. How about me? Oh, you were wonderful, Mr. Tinsel. Without you wrapped all around the tree, all the Christmas balls in the world wouldn't have looked good. Why, I'm surprised at you, all of you. You're all so conceited, just praising yourselves. You should be ashamed of yourselves. But why? What else do we live for, except to look our best during Christmas? After Christmas is over, we'll be laid away for another year. Well, it seems hardly worthwhile. Such a few days out of the year, and then to be shut up in that dark box again. I almost wish I were a rubber ball instead of a glass Christmas ball. I never thought of it like that. I suppose you all are very right. Oh, but you shouldn't feel bad, though. You bring so much joy and happiness into the world the short time you're on the tree that... Oh, do you really think so, Mr. Tinsel? Yes. Yes, you're right. We wouldn't trade places with anybody. All during the rest of the year, we think of the wonderful memories we have and of the joys we've brought. We just look forward to the next Christmas. Well, let's not talk of the rest of the year. We still have the whole Christmas before us to enjoy. People will come to look at us for the rest of the holiday, which is several days yet. That's right. But it will never be like this evening when everyone puts up the trees and puts us on the trees and opens the presents. Yes, I suppose that's right, Mr. Tinsel. But the red ball was wrong in saying that people would come to look at the Christmas tree for the next few days, for it stood neglected in the library and nobody came near it. Everybody in the house went about very quietly with anxious faces, for the little boy was very ill. Mother, I want the little golden star. Please bring it to me. She'll make me well again. Of course, Peter. Peter. Someone is coming into the room. Why, it's the nurse. I can tell by the cap and apron she is on. I wonder what she wants. That must be it. The golden star at the top. Why, she wants to take me. Peter must have asked for me. Oh, I'm so glad. Now I'll be able to stay with Peter. My, my, look at that little star shiver. It almost looks alive and happy. I'm taking her to Peter. Ah, there. That did it. Come on, little star. Down you come from the tree. And in we go to Master Peter. There you are, Master Peter. Here's the little star. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Oh, gosh. The doctor says I'm going to get better. But we know that you made me better, not the doctor. Because you've made me so happy. You've made me so happy by coming down to the earth for me. For now I know that I have a star in the heaven, which is mine and mine alone. And when you go back, I'll always be able to see you. And I'll know you're looking down at me. Just like Mother said. Go back now, little star. For now that we've found each other, you've made me so happy. And the next time you come down to the earth, you'll go back to the heavens together. Mother Moon! Mother Moon! Mother Moon! Mother Moon! I've accomplished what I wanted to do. I've found a heart that I belong to. Mother Moon! Mother Moon! Mother Moon! I'll be his shining star. Mother Moon! Mother Moon! I'll shine for him just like the wonderful Christmas star. Yes, Golden Star, you can come back now, for you yourself are the Christmas star now. Now that you've found each other, you'll never lose sight of each other again. We'll always be able to see you and know that you're his star. Come back, Golden Star. Come back to the wonderful entrance again. Look, Mother, the little star is going back. I can see her running through the skies. I see her, and she's shining so brightly. Can you see her, Mother? No, dear. Nobody can see her, for she's shining for you alone. Peter, you're better. Why, your face is all lit up and you have color again. Oh, the little star has made you well. Just look at her shine. She's blinking now. She's winking her eye at me. Oh, it's wonderful to find your own star. Yes, Peter, it is wonderful to find your own star. And the best part of all is that anybody can find his star shining for him, if he looks hard enough, just like you found yours. And so Peter was happy, and his mother was happy. But the happiest one of all was the golden star, who had at last found a heart to shine for, just like the Christmas star in Mother Moon's story. For now, she too was a Christmas star. And for now, she's not factÐ¾Ð²Ð°Ð». Then in her heart, she's overweight. The End You have heard The Christmas Star, written by Edward S.
