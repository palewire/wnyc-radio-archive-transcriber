Oh say can you see, by the dawn's early light, was so droly we hailed, and the twilight's last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous light by the dawn's early light. Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so drolly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave Thank you very much, Mr. Farrell. The invocation will now be pronounced by Dr. Francis Daly, Assistant Director of the Siemens Church Institute. Let us pray. O God, our Heavenly Father, send thy blessing we humbly pray thee Upon this nation of ours, and bless those into whose hands Thou hast committed the authority of government. Make us all ever mindful to learn, to know, and to do thy will That each one of us in our several callings may be better citizens. And especially we implore thy divine blessing at this time upon these thy servants About to be inducted into office of responsibility and authority In the service of their country. May thy Holy Spirit ever guide, guard, and direct them in all of their doings. And may thy heavenly blessing ever be upon them and upon us all. We ask it in thy most holy name. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Dr. Daly. Mr. Secretary, Commissioner Dunlop, Mr. Durning, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. At the outset, I wish to thank on behalf of Secretary Snyder and myself The customs brokers and forwarders who have so willingly consented that business be suspended Here in the Rotunda during these induction ceremonies. After due consideration, it was the opinion of Secretary Snyder and myself That there was no more appropriate place in the entire city of New York to hold these ceremonies Than in the customs house, which has been one of the principal sources of revenue For running the federal government over a period of many years These are historic premises And they again witness an important proceeding Our purpose this morning is to effect Reorganization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue Offices in New York City In accordance with the President's Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1952 As approved by the Congress Under the reorganization plan The Internal Revenue Service becomes The country over A career service Its objectives Are the best possible service to the public A maximum degree of efficiency And economy of operation And every possible freedom From suspicion of dishonesty Or betrayal of trust I want to acknowledge On behalf of the Treasury Department The effective support Which the reorganization plan had From Senator Herbert H. Lehman Representative Eugene J. Keough And the other members Of the New York Congressional Delegation The fact that the benefits of the plan Are being extended today To the New York City area Is due in no small measure To the endorsements Which Representative Keough And Senator Lehman gave it While it was pending before the Congress The ideas embodied In the reorganization plan Derived in part From a thorough Unbiased examination Into the structure And operating methods Of the Bureau of Internal Revenue By a New York firm Of management engineers The firm of Cresset McCormick And Paget Secretary Snyder Has recently had a letter From a partner Of these management engineers Mr. T.D.

revenue operations To a career service Was authorized By the President's Reorganization Plan Number 1 Of 1952 New York City Is the second area In which the plan Has been placed In effect

alone This area Produced 8 billion 400 millions Of dollars Of internal revenue Collections Including such sums As 3 billion 200 million In corporate Income And profits Taxes And 4 billions Of dollars

In alcohol Taxes And more than 80 millions Of dollars In retail Excess Taxes Were collect Excise taxes Were collected Here In one year This area Is now Processing Over 6 million Corporate Individual Payroll And other Federal Tax returns Simplification Of all Federal Tax Paying And tax Collecting Processes Was a major Goal In the preparation Of the revenue Service Reorganization Plan This goal Has been achieved In many important Respects Prior to the Reorganization Reports went To Washington From New York City Went through The offices Of three collectors Three internal Revenue agents In charge

Simplified Under the District Commissioner The Assistant District Commissioner For intelligence As very Important Responsibilities Under his Direction There will be Intensified Efforts To see that Every Fraudulent Attempt To evade Federal taxes Will bring Quick Investigation Inaction And action The task Of fighting Tax Frauds Never Was an Easy One In recent Years The criminal Element Has attempted Tax evasion With greater Persistence Than ever Before It is our Determination That this Persistence Of tax evaders Will be Met By the Special Agents Of the Revenue Service With even Greater Enforcement Activity And prosecution Last year Additional Taxes And penalties Resulting From tax Fraud Investigations In this Area Amounted To Approximately 75 Million Dollars This Activity Will be Stepped Up Under The Direction Of the Assistant District Commissioner For Intelligence To the Full Limit Of Available Manpower The Fact That The Reorganization Plan Makes Possible A More Thorough

Employees Promotion Opportunities Are Being Broadened Throughout The Field Service It Is A Significant Fact That The Reorganization Of The Revenue Service Has Been Accomplished Through Six Years Of Intensive Study And Effort It Was By No Means A Quickly Conceived Plan It Becomes Evident It Became Evident To Me Shortly After I Became Secretary Of The Treasury In 1946 That Revenue Service Had Suffered Severely Due To The Conditions Under Which It Had To Expand Under Wartime Restrictions And Developments There Had Been A Great Increase In The Number Of Tax Returns Filed And The Amount Of Revenue Collected Many Expert Employees Had Been The Workload Had Increased Enormously And The Bureau Had Not Been Able To Modernize Its Operations Due To Shortage Of Up-To Date Equipment We Immediately Set About To Improve Management Methods And Achieve Greater Operating Efficiency But Every Change Had To Be Made Without Interrupting The Service's Continued Task Of Collecting Revenues And Enforcing The Tax Law Conferences Were Held With Many Groups Of Revenue Officials As Early As October 1946 To Discuss Problems And Suggest Solutions A Work Simplification Program Was Set Up As A Means Of Enlisting The Aid Of Every Employee Towards Improved Efficiency Task Forces Of Closest Attention A Firm Of Management Engineers Was Employed To Analyze Operations Of The Service And Suggest Other Improvements The Alcohol Tax And Tobacco Tax Divisions Of The Bureau Were Consolidated In This Fashion For Six Years We Have Gradually Reorganizing The Bureau Of Internal Revenue Until We Have Reached This Final Step In A Long Series Of Actions Taken By The Treasury Department To Improve And Streamline The Federal Tax Collection System The President's Reorganization Plan Number One Of 1952 Is The Capstone Of This Progressive Development In Placing The Plans In Effect We Have Made It Our Objective That Only The Most Capable Persons Available Would Be Named To The Positions Of District Commissioner Of Internal Revenue Director Of Internal Revenue And Other Supervisory Post To Accomplish This End I Set Up A Selection Board Made Up Of Revenue Which Acting Under Civil Service Commission Rules And Regulations Has Inquired Painstakingly Into The Qualifications And Records Of All Applicants And Appointees The Installation Of The Reorganized Internal Revenue Service Here Today
