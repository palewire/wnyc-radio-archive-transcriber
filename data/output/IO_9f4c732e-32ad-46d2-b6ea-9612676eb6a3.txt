WNYC presents The Man Without a City. The Man Without a City The Man Without a City The Man Without a City This is the story of Jeremiah P. Driftwood, a man with a mind of his own, a little too much of his own. As a matter of fact, there are times when Jerry can be downright stubborn. Our story opens in Jerry's bachelor apartment at 613 East 71st Street. It's morning and he's shaving when the phone rings. All right. All right. Hello? Oh, it's you, honey. No, no, Barbara. I'm not mad at you. Well, I just cut myself shaving. Oh, everything's going wrong this morning. No, no. Of course, I still love you, Barbara. Yes, baby. And you're sweet, too. One o'clock at Luigi's. I'll be there. Goodbye. No, where did... Where... Where's that darn collar button? Jeremiah P. Driftwood. Huh? Jeremiah P. Driftwood. You left the water running. Water? So what? Say, I can't see you. Who are you anyway? Never mind who I am. Your faucet is open. Oh, I'll go find another house to haunt. I have enough troubles of my own. Let me see now. Where's that collar button? Jeremiah P. Driftwood. Turn off that tap. You left the water running. Oh, go soak your head if you've got one. You've wasted 14 gallons already. Go away, buddy. You bother me. There is a serious shortage. I'm in a hurry, and this creep raves about some measly water. Your city asks you to cooperate. Nuts. What did the city ever do for me? They can go fly a kite. Then you refuse to cooperate? Look, buddy, as far as I'm concerned, this cooperating business is a lot of malarkey. Do you realize what you are saying? I sure do. As a matter of fact, I wish I had absolutely nothing to do with the city, and the city had absolutely nothing to do with me. That is your desire? Yes. So be it, Jeremiah P. Driftwood. Wish granted. Extra, extra. Jeremiah P. Driftwood refuses to recognize New York City. Extra, extra. J.P. Driftwood refuses to recognize New York City. Hey, what have you got against New York City, Mr. Driftwood? Well, nothing personal. I just want to have nothing to do with it. That's all. Where were you born, Mr. Driftwood? Well, in the second largest borough of a certain city whose name I do not care to mention. Well, how did you arrive at your momentous decision, Mr. Driftwood? I just did. That's all. How do you predict your action will affect New York City's way of life? No comment. Can we quote you on that, sir? Certainly. Now, if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have some important business to attend to. Good day, gentlemen. Thank you, Mr. Driftwood. All right, boys, hop on. Look out for that garbage canvas, Mr. Driftwood. Oh, my new suit. What's my garbage doing here? Why wasn't it removed? Hey, hey, you. You up on that truck. Sanitation man. You calling me, buddy? Yes. What's my garbage doing here? Looks to me like it's just laying there. Well, why didn't you collect it? Oh, I'm sorry, buddy. Guess I must have overlooked it. Well, don't let it happen again. Oh, I wonder how I passed that up. Well, up she goes. Hey, there's something screwy here. This garbage don't dump. I can't figure it. Doesn't dump? Why, that's absurd. Look, I'm dumping and dumping, but I don't dump. Nonsense. Who ever heard of garbage that doesn't dump? Well, look for yourself, Mr. It's impossible. Didn't you ever hear of the law of gravity? I don't care what law you pull on me, mister. This garbage ain't dumping. Here, let me show you. Say, that's funny. 17 years in the department, and this is the first time I... Hey, mister. Let me take a good look at you. Uh-huh. Same eyes. Same nose. You're the guy. You're him. From who? I seen your picture in the papers. You're that driftwood fellow, ain't you? Yes. You're the guy who won't have nothing to do with the city and vice versa, ain't you? You're darn tootin'. Now I get it. Now I know why your garbage won't dump. What do you mean? The sanitation department is a branch of the city, ain't it? Mister, you're getting just what you asked for. Well, what am I supposed to do now? Eh, it's your headache, mister. I suggest you start raising pigs. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Well, I wouldn't let them collect my garbage if they paid me. I'll give it to charity. That's what I'll do. I'll give it to charity. Hey, hey, I can't waste time. I gotta meet Barbara. I better get to a subway. Come on, mister. I gotta get in the subway, too. My boss is an awful fusspot. There's something wrong with this turnstile. My dime won't go in. You're not trying to dip in a slug, are you, mister? They send people to jail for that. Of course not. Here, look at it. Looks okay to me. Sounds all right. I guess it's bona fide. Why don't you try another turnstile? I did. It didn't work there, either. I'll try this next one. Nope, the same here. Some men find everything so difficult. Here, give me your dime. Let me try. Sure, here. See? Went in like a charm. And they say women are the weaker sex. Oh, I can't understand it. Maybe you haven't got the right touch, mister. It's not what you do. It's the way that you do it. Go ahead in. Well, thanks. Now the turnstile's stuck. It won't turn. Some men are so helpless. Push harder. I am pushing. Step aside, mister. Let's see if it works for me. Okay. See? It works. Hey. I always say it takes a woman's brains to run the world. I hear a train coming. So long, mister. I'm late already, and my boss is such an awful fuss. Hey, hey, my dime. Come back. Oh, well, I'll try another. This dime won't go in either. Maybe I'm not pushing hard enough. There. There it's going. Ow. My eye. It bounced right back. Hey, hey, hey. What kind of funny business has gone on here, mister? I've been watching you. Well, I just put my dime in, and it jumped back and hit me in the eye. Is it? Well, in my 12 years as a station agent, I heard all kinds of stories. But, brother, this sure is a new one on me. It's no story. Put a dime in yourself and see. Now, look, mister. The Board of Transportation pays me to make change at this station, not to be dropping dimes into turnstiles. Board of Transportation. City Department. Aye. Now I get it. Well, they know what they can do with their old subway. Looks like I better take a taxi if I want to meet Barbara on time. Taxi. Hey, hey, taxi. Oh, the trouble you have getting a cab these days. Taxi. Taxi. Where to, buddy? Luigi's Restaurant. 56 in Lexington. I'm in a hurry. It causes me great pain, my friend, to be unable to accommodate you at this moment. Huh? It is the appointed hour for me midday meal. However, should you care to wait until I have partaken of me repast, I would deem it a privilege to transport you to your destination. But I have no time. I'm in a hurry. Ah, hurry. The bane of our civilization. You know something? It was a great sage who said, he who hurries loses time. But I... On the other hand, what is time? A void of nothingness, resting in the lap of eternity. Look here, I can't argue with you. Are you going to... One moment, my friend. Food for the intellect takes precedence over sustenance for the stomach, right? I will gladly forego me meal for the pleasure of coming to gripe with a first-class mind such as yours. Look, buddy. Would you be kind enough, my friend, to step into me humble taxi cab so that we may discuss the eternal verities at our leisure? No, I got to get to 56th Street and Lexington right away. He was truly a sage who observed. The brute aggrandizes, the wise man compromises. Come on, leave us proceed to 56th Street and Lexington Avenue, but slowly. Enter, sir. Thanks. Eh, modern conveyances. You know something? The invention of the wheel was mankind's greatest blunder. Yeah, yeah. Let's get rolling. And what is a wheel but a diameter surrounded by a circumference? What is your opinion, my friend? My opinion is that you ought to get the motor started. Eh, motors. Generators of power. And what is power but a false illusion? Please, how about starting? For you, my friend, I start. But first, the little flag on the meter is gonna go down. Hey, it refuses to descend. Come on, come on. I'm exerting pressure, but it resists me. Get it down, please. I haven't got all day. Hey, wait a minute. Perhaps it is symbolic. Perhaps the fates would have us sit here and debate certain truths that are greater than both of us. Look, if you can't get going, I'll have to get out of this cab. Look, I wish to accommodate you, but I cannot proceed until this here little flag descends. Then get it down or else I get out. I am unable to do so. Too bad. Hey, my friend. My friend, come back. The little flag has descended. Oh, good. Now, let's get going. Yeah, we... Hey, holy cats, the little flag has flown up again. Hey, what can it mean? I don't care what it means. All I want is to get to 56th Street. Slam it down again. Yeah. I'm straining, but it resists me. Hey, perhaps with a phenomenon such as this, it is wiser to be gentle, even compassionate. Push harder, please. Yeah, but I got no alternative but to report this here incident to the Hack Bureau. What did you say? I got no alternative... No, no. Report it to who? The Hack Bureau. See, it's within their province. The Bureau certifies me as a licensed hackman. They oversee the operation of this little flag and the meter as well. License Bureau City. Now I get it. Huh? Well, if that's the way they want to play ball, it's okay with me. So long, my friend. Wait a minute. I guess I better start walking if I ever hope to meet Barbara. Hello, Barbara. I'm sorry I'm late. Oh, Jerry Driftwood. Of all days to be late. Oh, I'm sorry, honey, but all things got a little out of control. Say, why are you standing outside? I thought we were supposed to meet inside Luigi's. We were. But read this sign in the window. To all my fine customers who do me great honor to enjoy my chicken cacciatore and other special dishes, I'm pleased to announce that today Luigi's is closed. Huh? I am attend the graduation of my son, Raphael, from the Academy of Policemen. After six o'clock, Raphael is a regular cops, and I open the store with free wine for all, sign Luigi. Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. Police department. Even Luigi's tied up with a city. What did you say? Oh, nothing, nothing. Honey, did you see the papers this morning? Oh, I didn't get a chance to. Good. Let's find a place to eat. Wait, Jerry, you're acting so peculiar today. Huh? Oh, how about this place? It's only a cafeteria, but the food's good. All right. Here's an empty table. Let me have you check, honey. I'll get it all on mine. What do you have? Just a tuna on white and coffee. No dessert? No, thanks. Well, sit tight, baby. I'll be back in a jiffy. I'll be back in. A tuna on white and ham and cheese on rye. Butter and lettuce? A little mayonnaise on the tuna, please. Pickle? Yeah, please. Here you are. Thanks. Check, please. We have to punch it, you know. No charge account. Oh, I'm sorry. Here. That's 35 and... What's wrong with my puncher? It won't punch. It was working a minute ago. Now it goes on the blink. Gee whiz. Say, Emma, can I loan you puncher for a minute? Mine's gofluey. Thanks. Hey, this one's stuck, too. I can't figure it. Miss, do you happen to have anything to do with the city? What do you mean? Are you connected with the city in any manner, shape, or form? It's important. Well, I took a civil service exam once, but I didn't make out so good. No, no. I mean right now. My boyfriend's a fireman, if that's what you mean. No, how about yourself? You personally? Well, every so often I have to report to the Board of Health. I'm a licensed food handler, you know. Every one of us here has to... That's enough. Cancel those sandwiches. Well, of all the screwy customers. Come on, Barbara, let's get out of here. But our food, we haven't eaten yet. Oh, Jerry, stop pulling my arm. Check, please. Here, they're both blank. Jerry, look out for that revolving door. Oh, now that we're outside, will you please explain what's gotten into you today? Oh, what a bump. I don't care about your bump. First, you bark at me over the phone. Well, I didn't mean to bark at you, Barbara. Honest, I didn't. Well, it certainly sounded like a bark to me. Then you show up late at Luigi's. Well, I started out on time, Barbara, honey, but, well, I couldn't... If you really wanted to, you could have. And now you pull me into some cafeteria and then drag me out before I can even get seated, let alone have a bite to eat. I demand an explanation, Jerry Driftwood. I refuse to go a single step further with a madman like you. I guess I'll have to explain it sooner or later, so here goes. Well, it better be good. Barbara, honey, today... Today was going to be the day. I finally got up enough courage. I decided to ask you to marry me, but... Jerry, darling, oh, you great big bashful boy. Oh, let me kiss you. But, Barbara, honey... Oh, I know why you were so nervous. Oh, Jerry, you should have known, I'd say yes. You don't understand, Barbara. I can't even take a taxi. What does that matter, darling? Money isn't everything as long as we love each other. Please let me explain, Barbara. You don't realize... Oh, don't worry, darling. I understand everything. I don't care if you're rich or poor. What do I care if you lost your job? We'll manage. With me for a husband, you'll be... I'll be the happiest woman in the world. I know, but... Jerry, do you really and truly love me? Of course I love you, Barbara, honey. I love you more than anything else in the world. That's all I want to hear. For a moment, I thought you didn't want to marry me. Oh, Jerry, darling, I have a wonderful idea. Let's go down to City Hall right now and take out a marriage license. City Hall, license, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Jeremiah, Jeremiah, P. Driftwood, there is still time. Turn off your faucet. No, no, no. Jeremiah, P. Driftwood, turn off that tap. No, no, no. Oh, oh, oh, gee, gee, I must have been talking in my sleep. I'm all sweaty. What a dream. Oh, gosh, the, the water's dripping. I've got to shut it off. Save water. Can't waste water. Whew. Ah, that's better. I wonder why it bothered me so. I wish I could remember what I dreamt. Hello? Barbara? How are you, honey? That's good. You, you're not angry with me? Oh, no, no, no good reason. I just wonder, that's all. Of course I love you, baby. As much as ever, more. Meet me at Luigi's. Sure, sure, I'll hold everything. I got a better idea. Why wait? Let's meet in front of the city hall. Let's take out our marriage license today. You have been listening to the man without a city, presented by your city station as a reminder of things past and present.
