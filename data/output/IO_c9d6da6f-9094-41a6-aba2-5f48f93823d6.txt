Of course, we have emergency crews in the field and are spending every effort to restore service as promptly as possible. We had a message before from you concerning action to be taken by the people of the city of New York who are subscribers to Con Edison. Well, we would like to repeat that it would help us a great deal if customers would report their lack of service only once. Every time a report is made, a ticket is filled out, and it would increase our paperwork if customers called more than once. Ladies and gentlemen, you've been listening to a report from Con Edison on the power situation in New York at the present time. We will keep you fully informed. Your city station, WNYC, operating on an assigned frequency of 830 kilocycles by authority of the Federal Communications Commission, is now compelled to leave the air. The voice of New York City has been at your service, bringing you the finest in music, the latest news, and public service programs of special interest. We invite you to tune to WNYC-FM at 93.9 megacycles on your FM dial for other fine programs. Your city station operates under the direct supervision of Mayor Vincent R. Impelletari, with Seymour N. Siegel as director. And so, until 7 o'clock tomorrow morning, the voice of New York City bid you all good night. Ladies and gentlemen, our national anthem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
