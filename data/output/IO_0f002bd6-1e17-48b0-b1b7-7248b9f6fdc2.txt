A spiritual is just sung by the choristers. And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Bore, accompanist, in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their dear dear dear dear, down a lock on the door, pray somebody's a-goin' to rob them, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? What for? What for? I've got no luck on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that'll pay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are on me. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no sun, and the moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of plenty, God will pray all the day. Keeps the plenty, you know how to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, and it's time to rise. Never worry long, and I'm well. Never want to strive to be gone. I am a friend of hell, and it's time to rise. Never want to be long, and I'm well. Never want to strive to be gone. Never want to be long, and I'm well. Never want to strive to be gone, to be bad. What the hell? Why you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, for heaven, all day long. Now you complain. I've got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Beth.
