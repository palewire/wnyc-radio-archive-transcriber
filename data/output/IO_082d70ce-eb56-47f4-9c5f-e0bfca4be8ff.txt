This has been a most busy week at City Hall. The mayor of the city of New York has had a constant stream of visitors into our great and wonder city, New York, beginning Monday with His Excellency, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Likad Ali Khan, and his charming lady. Yesterday we had the governor of the federal city of Mexico, and today we are receiving the mayors of all the various principalities outside the United States. In other words, a reception for the international group of mayors who are now visiting in New York City. They will be introduced by the chairman. There will be representatives from Switzerland, Argentina, Bremen, Germany, Hilo, Hawaii, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, St. Boniface, Manitoba, Canada, the mayor of Rome, the mayor of Helsinki, and so on through the list. One of the most outstanding features of this reception today is the magnificently resplendent Banda Tipica de Policia of the Federal District of Mexico, under the leadership of Pablo Hernández Maran, director. They have the most amazing uniforms. They look like a group of toreadors. They're dressed in dark blue, very richly embroidered in gold braids. They wear white collars and red silk neckties, and they've been entertaining here in the council chamber at City Hall. They just finished a very interesting number now, and we're waiting for the mayors themselves to make their appearance under escort of the mayor's committee in City Hall today. Mr. John A. Dykes is acting chairman of the mayor's committee today, and the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, will receive the distinguished mayors from the different parts of the world, present scrolls, and do all the honors that he is noted for as the charming host of our city. The weatherman has played rather ducks and drakes with our spectacle today. It was hoped to hold it outside, but the inclemency and uncertainty of the weather, every time it was almost decided to hold it in front of City Hall, why, down came the rain, and it was finally transferred to the council chamber, where at least our guests will not be wet with the summer showers that seem to be prevailing all throughout today, according to the weatherman early this morning. Now, while we're waiting, and this organization, this Banda Tipica de Palicia of Mexico, is so interesting that maybe we can get them to play a number, if it's possible to do so. The way across the room there, if I can get someone's eye to give them a signal, we'll get a sample of the music before we actually go on the air. And now here they are. The conductor is going to start a number for your special benefit. . Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

And here's the band again. I'm so I would like to die of feeling. Oh, the land of the sun, I'm looking for you. Now that I'm in peace, I live without light, without love. And when I'm so sad, I'm so sad to see the wind. I would like to cry, I would like to die of feeling. Oh, the land of the sun, I'm looking for you. Now that I'm far away, I live without light, without love. And when I'm so sad, I would like to cry. I would like to die of feeling. And now to this magnificent music by the band of Tipica de Policia of the Federal District of Mexico. Senor Marina directing. Here comes the procession as the mayors, the international group of mayors who are visiting our city, escorted by Mayor O'Dwyer and Mr. A. Dykes, come down the aisle of our very beautiful council chamber here in City Hall. It's quite a procession and very, very impressive indeed. One thing we learned from these receptions at City Hall is the wonderful progress and enthusiasm of everybody for that which is good and great and fine. It's brought out in these receptions because the visitors from these various parts of the world who come here are certainly indicating in every way that they can that they're doing their part to make it a better, brilliant and more lovable and livable world. And every indication is so carried out here today. And against the brilliant and blazing color and background of the band of Tipica of Mexico, why this scene today is truly a very beautiful one. I really wonder if the Marquis de Lafayette, who is looking down from the walls here in the council chamber, from that $350,000 portrait by Charles W. Morris, the inventor of the telegraph, I wonder what he would think if he could come back to life and see this room again. And now the mayor's committee chairman, Mr. A. Dykes. Just a few moments now for a shake hand and introduction of a few more guests and Mr. A. Dykes to speak. He's waiting for the guests to be seated. Now Mr. A. Dykes. We will open our ceremonies by having the Star Spangled Banner played by the banda Tipica di Palaccia. The Poets of the Father is at Dun soda atmeti Battle. The Poets are important to come.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. to which New York City is this year the host city. To officially welcome these dignitaries to our city, I now present to you the Honorable William O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York. The State Ikes, President of our National Conference of Mayors, Mayor Cooper Green of Birmingham, Alabama, the distinguished visitors, not the least of which the band Atipica, who has just now so beautifully given us our own national anthem on their instruments. I'll ask you, ladies and gentlemen, for one round of applause for that beautiful music. The gentlemen who are here with us today, as Mr. Ed Ikes has said, are high officials in cities of many lands. They speak many different languages. But I am sure that all of them join me in understanding the magnificent language of this beautiful music that we've just heard. And that each of them joins me in a tribute to the members of the band Atipica de Policia and to their leader, Senor Pablo Hernández Nárin. As Mr. Ed Ikes has said, the United States Conference of Mayors has honored this city for the second time for their convention and conferences. And they have invited the mayors and other municipal executives from this and other nations to attend their annual meetings, which is held, as I say, this year in New York City. Our guests today, delegates to the conference, represent nations and territories near and far. They have come to New York to discuss the problems of their cities. They hope, and so do we, by interchanging ideas with fellow executives in free and democratic discussion to help their people and to help all others. Every city has problems, and as it grows, these problems grow with it. They become ever larger and more numerous. when millions and millions live where thousands lived before. The duties of government in protecting health, in providing education, and in supervising all the services that are essential to orderly urban living become enormously multiplied. We have seen that here in our own city and in many others. The proper functioning of these services of government is one of the tenets in the creed of the United States Conference of Mayors. These gentlemen, our guests, are devoted to that creed. That is why they are here. They will impart knowledge, and we hope they will receive knowledge. Let us pray that they have success and understandings in all their meetings, for their gain is our gain as well. Let us wish them happiness here and at home, knowing that their work will help free people throughout the world along the way to our common objective, a better and a safer future for the peoples of the whole world. Thank you. And now, so that these distinguished visitors may be officially welcomed by the United States Conference of Mayors, I present to you the Honorable W. Cooper Green, President of the United States Conference of Mayors, and Mayor of the City of Birmingham, Alabama. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Mayor Dwyer, my colleagues in municipal government, citizens of New York. I'm very happy and proud on behalf of the United States Conference of Mayors as its president for the year 1949-50 to say welcome to these guests from our neighboring nations, and we want them to know we're happy to have them in our midst. We know that their problems, after discussing with them individually, are the same as the problems of all the cities of our country. And to Mayor Dwyer, on behalf of these guests who have asked me to say for them that they're proud to be in the City of New York, they're happy to be with you at this 1950 convention as your host, as you are the host of the conference, and we want all to know that it's a great honor and privilege to be in New York, and especially to be with our colleague, Mayor Dwyer.

When you pass this building, don't look at it and think it looks old. Yes, it does. It isn't a skyscraper. It was built when the hearts of America were young and tremulous and beating and hoping that the Constitution of the United States would hold, giving to every man the liberty, the promise, and the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And the building stands today a gesture of beauty and proportion. And proportion is, after all, the thing that is most beautiful in life. Let's try and be disproportionate in our reactions to our wonderful city. Epitomized here today in Mayor O'Dwyer's welcome to the international group of mayors. Now the party is breaking up. That is all from the Council Chamber. We return you to the studios in the Municipal Building. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
