My father, the late Israel Sachs, who established the Sachs Foundation, had another view. He believed that if only in terms of enlightened self-interest, a business should serve the community from which it draws its sustenance. A community free of tensions and antagonisms, a community that has learned to live with itself, is, to state it simply, a good community in which to do business. I know I don't have to impress this audience with the importance of such a view in a city born and raised in a melting pot tradition and its ultimate impact on the entire family of nations. There are two operational phases in the Sachs Foundation. One is on a philanthropic level, dealing with organized charity and welfare work. The other is on a neighborhood level, the objective of which is better understanding among people with different racial and religious backgrounds. We seek to bring people together to learn, to laugh, to discuss. Our Homemakers College offers free adult courses, some in cooperation with the College of the City of New York. Our teenage canteens, conducted in our store auditoriums, are a meeting place for young people. Our women's advisory panels give us an opportunity to meet with a changing group of representative local women to discuss and seek solutions for problems in a wide sphere. Our work has brought us especially close to the schools of New York. The Board of Education has given official in-service courses in one of our store auditoriums. Each year, for the past eight years, 40,000 school children with their teachers have been our guests at our annual pre-Christmas marionette shows. And we are looking forward to playing host to even a larger number this year. We have been invited to participate in the graduation exercises of many schools and have presented awards for scholastic and athletic achievement. We have sponsored art contests among our school children. And tomorrow morning, for instance, we are holding the first meeting of a special scholarship class in advanced art instruction for 40 talented children selected by school principals. It is against this background of community activity that the Sachs Foundation is proud to have this opportunity to join in honoring a group of citizens who have served their community well. Particularly, do we wish to salute a group with whose problems we are familiar? A group whose labors are essential to the present and future welfare of our city? A group that has accepted a huge and I am sure frequently thankless task. I speak of the committee chairman of our board of education. Often, of a great personal sacrifice, they give their time and much of their strength to the service of the youth of this one of the world's greatest cities. Their compensation all too often is nothing but a generous dose of headache powders. And all too infrequently, the applause and appreciation of the people they serve so well. To help rectify this imbalance, to demonstrate tangibly the great debt of gratitude owed to them by the people of the city of New York for truly distinguished service, the trustees of the Sachs Foundation have voted to present to the committee chairman of the Board of Education. These certificates of appreciation, which read, for having served the city of New York and its youth in the field of education and community service with dedication, devotion and distinction, they have earned the gratitude and esteem of the citizens of their city. I have the honor to present to the chairman of the committee on finance and budget, this certificate, Honorable Vito F. Lanza. To the chairman of the committee in instructional affairs, Dr. Charles F. Rank. The chairman. That's a great choice. Thanks very much. That's for your civic puak. Thank you and thank all my own multiracial abilities, it's really excellent. That's what I appreciate? Thank you. Thank you. To the Honorable George A. Timon, who unfortunately was unable to be present today. Listen, let me have to... Thank you, thank you. For Mr. Timon. To Colonel... To the Chairman of the Committee on Retirement and of the Special Committee on Civilian Defense, Colonel Arthur Leavitt. To the Chairman of the Special Committee on Veterans and Reconversion Training, the Honorable Cornelius J. Walsh. To all of you, my thanks for your patience and attention. Thank you, Mr. Sachs. It is always easy in life to be picayune, to be small, and to find things to complain about. And not having any responsibility yourself to say how the other fellow should be doing it better. But just try it yourself someday when you have the responsibility and see what happens. A very eminent person. I believe Mrs. Roosevelt herself, who is with us here today, once said that one who occupies a high position in public service should be impervious and have the hide of a rhinoceros to adverse criticism. I would like to add to that today, if Mrs. Roosevelt will permit, and say that in addition to the impervious hide of a rhinoceros, one must have the wisdom of all the saints and sages rolled together. And still, the person would be deemed inadequate by so many people. But that is the very test of our democracy, the ability to complain, even if complaints are unfounded. And introducing the next speaker, I think that one of the most wonderful things that could be said about any individual is his feeling for his fellow man. Is the principles that guide him in his everyday work in high office, his interest around the clock in all peoples and not particular segments. And I think that interest in all peoples was best evidenced when the plans were only in the talking stage of these great edifices here we see today and occupy known as the United Nations building. And there were those who were of faint heart and faint words and did not have either the imagination or the drive to conceive that not in the far distance future of a matter of a few months that these buildings would be here and occupied. It was the mayor of the city of New York who had that vision and that dynamic interest and feeling for his fellow human being. And his busy calendar around the clock, almost 24 hours, almost beyond human endurance, is the best testimony to his great interest in his fellow man. It is my privilege and honor at this time to introduce to you his honor, the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Vincent Impeletere. Mr. Bensley, Reverend Clergy, Mrs. Roosevelt, Mr. Cohn, Borough President Wagner, President Clausen, Commissioner Moses, Mr. Sacks, Monsignor Drew, ladies and gentlemen, and particularly on this occasion, the boys and girls of our high schools. I am always happy to accept invitations of the Board of Education to participate in exercises where awards are made, irrespective of race or religion, for unusual service to our community. As mayor, I would like to state that the city of New York sets the pattern in its day-to-day living of mutual understanding among all the peoples of our city. The daily calendar of the city of New York demonstrates that the activities of various strains of people are blended harmoniously together for better everyday living and better everyday understanding. The Board of Education, an unpaid group with a very deep sense of civic consciousness as well as civic responsibility, has worked diligently in the interests of the school children of our city. And in behalf of the children of our community, I wish to thank Mr. Bensley and the Board of Education for initiating this venture to bring to clear light the ties of brotherhood for the betterment of races, religions, and peoples, not only in our own city, but throughout the entire free world. The Honorable Andrew G. Clausen, Jr., having been appointed twice as a member of the Board of Education, elected, just imagine that, elected five times as President of the Board. So, serving on many committees of the Board, acting as the liaison officer between the Board of Education, various city agencies, and at times with the Mayor, and having been decorated by many foreign governments for his keen interest in public education. I hereby grant him this certificate as a token of the esteem in which he is held by all the people of the City of New York. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. The next award will be made in absentia because the recipient of this reward is a distinguished citizen of our city who has arrived at the rather young age of 98, but in spite of that age, is still active in her community endeavors. And representing the award winner on this occasion, and who will receive the certificate and medal in her behalf, is Mrs. Mildred McCaffrey. I'd like to read this citation.

Your persistence and diligence for the public public will have provided models of dynamic citizenship to your fellow men. Especially to the younger generation seeking to follow in your footsteps. Did I say without a vision? You see, even mayors make mistakes. A task with a vision is victory. In this sense, Bob, you have been nobly victorious, and I might add, going beyond the bounds of this citation, that the citation only covers a very few of Bob's real accomplishments for his city. Thank you. A purpose reserved for the last award winner, a great citizen, not only of the United States but of the world, Mrs. Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Fide et fortitudine.

Before the First Lady of the world responds, the children of the public schools of the City of New York wish to speak. They will speak with flowers and present them to Mrs. Roosevelt. Will Miss Elaine Summers of Junior High School 22 come forward and Miss Francine Bensley of the School of Science come forward and make the presentation? On behalf of all of those who have been honored here today, the First Lady of the World will respond. Mr. Chairman. Reverend clergy, your honor the mayor, Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sacks. It is a very great honor for me to respond on behalf of all of those who have been honored here today. I think that we are very grateful, first because it is an honor to receive something from the Board of Education, to be considered worthy, to be given honor by them, and to have the Sacks Foundation, which has done something, I think, very important in this community. For business to underline the fact that it is not only necessary to earn a living, but to serve the community in which you earn that living is of value not only to one community, but to all communities. And therefore, I think all of us who receive these awards are conscious of pride in having been given them and of humbleness. a lot of us who receive these awards. I would like to say just a few words to the young people who are here today, because in a sense, these awards are particularly significant to you young people. They symbolize to you the fact that people who are given opportunity and are able to do something for their communities, do have a special place in their communities. And I think that the values that such awards set should be well understood by the young people. We all of us know in history that we have been told from the very earliest days that our first responsibility was to look after our families, to earn a living, to be useful in the community in which we lived. But here, there is singled out the value of the work done for the community unselfishly. And I think that is very important for our young people to remember. I have young people frequently ask me how they can achieve their ambitions along different lines. And of course, there are many ways to achieve ambitions. But it is not often that young people realize when they are young that one of the ambitions that every citizen of a democracy should have is the ambition to be of service to their fellow citizens and to their community. And I think these awards point out that fact. And I hope that you will remember that it is the grasping of opportunities that are offered you to do sometimes what seem very little things, which finally bring you the opportunities to really serve your community. And there is no greater reward than service to other human beings. In a small way or in a large way, it will always bring you great reward. I think all of us who have been singled out today, they feel that we are really only symbols because in every community there are and must be hundreds of citizens who serve and who do work that deserves recognition just as much as the few people who happen to be recognized. But the mere fact that we are symbols is important, I think, because it should actually give to every person who has an opportunity to do something in the community a sense of greater importance, a sense that it is recognized as valuable, that one is able to do something for the people of the community. I think in the United States, we have perhaps the greatest responsibility that has ever come to any nation before, because we have become the symbol of democracy to the world. And so everything that happens in any community of this nation is judged as the expression of what we believe democracy to be. And for that reason, it is important that the leaders and the followers should constantly have in mind this great responsibility of making every community in our nation what we really believe democracy should give to the people of our nation. And also to the people of all lands. And so today, I thank you again, both the Board of Education and the Sachs Foundation, for all of us who have been honored today. And we humbly accept, but we hope, that this may simply be an opening of wider opportunities, not only for us, but for many others, to serve the creation of a better democracy, democracy to continue the realization in the world of what democracy can do for humanity. On behalf of the Honorable Vincent Impeleturi, Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable Andrew Claussen, the Honorable Andrew Claussen, President of the Board of Education, and the members of the Board of Education, and Mr. William Sachs, President of the Sachs Foundation, we extend our thanks to the Honorable Trig V. Lee, Secretary General of the United Nations, his associates and staff. Our thanks to the Honorable Mrs. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, her associates and her staff. The Honorable Dr. Benjamin Cohn, his associates and his staff for all the arrangements that made it possible for us to assemble here today, in this magnificent hall, to witness these exercises dedicated to the individuals who have rendered such extraordinary service on behalf of the children of the City of New York. In the presence of so many high-ranking guests, including heads of states and nations throughout the world, one is tempted to direct the concluding words to such distinguished persons. We will depart from this procedure at this time, and with due deference to our honored guests, say that these ceremonies here today have the deepest significance, because all of us here have addressed ourselves to the ambassadors of the next generation, those who will inherit our institutions and the hope of tomorrow, the young boys and girls who have been sitting here in this hall. May they take from these proceedings today a lesson in life, a lesson in brotherhood. May their years be enriched in the services of their country and all of mankind. Thank you for attending, and these exercises have now been concluded. Thank you very much.
