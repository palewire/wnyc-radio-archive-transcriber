Here's the first night of paradise, honey. Two little girls in blue, lad, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad, two little girls in blue, lad, two little girls in blue. One your father called, became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted above. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I do. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrow, sharing each other's joy. Come, rat, when man was born, they blew their life in time. When danger threatened, my darling, old comrade, was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken, and a mother's heart have broken. There is just another missing from the old home that is all. There is still a memory living. There's a father unforgiving. And a picture that is true for the world. She's my sweetheart, I'm her boy. She's my honey, I'm her boy. She's my sweetheart. She's my sweetheart. To never depart To give the money to me In my sweet heart One evening in the month of May I met old Satan on the way I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die If you want to get to heaven in the good old way I looked old Satan on the way I looked old Satan on the way I looked old Satan on the way I looked old Satan on the way I looked old Satan on the way I looked old Satan on the way I looked old Satan on the way I looked old Satan on the way My darling, I must leave you, oh, it brings my heart to soul. Don't think that me I am needed, but I'm strong to fight the war. Say the white is over my heart, and I can't no longer play. And I'm strong to fight the war, and I can't no longer play. After the fall is over, after the praise of God, after the dancers are leaving, and through the stars are gone, still your heart is waiting. If you'd greet them all, the heart of all. Come to me, sweet Marie, not because your face is fair enough to see. But your soul, so pure and sweet, makes my happiness complete. Makes me fodder at your feet, sweet Marie. Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that style? Isn't it a lovely one and just a proper style? I'd just like to have one, just the same as that. Where ever I go, they shout, hello! Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir, but not goodbye. But not goodbye. The past is dead. The past is dead. Love cannot die. Love cannot die. The world better fall had we not met. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. The End The End The End
