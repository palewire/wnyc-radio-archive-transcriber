Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. New Yorkers have come to City Hall Park this evening to watch one of the town's Christmas time traditions, the lighting of the city Christmas trees. During this program, taking place on the steps of City Hall, you'll hear Mayor F.H. Lagardia's annual Christmas message to his fellow citizens. And after the mayor's address, his son Eric is scheduled to press the switch that will light the 22 Christmas trees in the parks in all the five boroughs, including the 40-foot tree in front of City Hall. And now we take you to the front of the City Hall steps where we hear a musical program by the New York City Police Department, Glee Club. Thank you. Thank you. Heaven's Father, come ye home. The ball head as I understand Is the bravest king in all the land. When most be decked with the gate alone And also be repound before. Of the hungry they bear home Red and solid, come ye home. The Lord hath provided this In honor of the King of Leeds Which on this day it will be served in His very mercy on the earth. The poor of the hungry they bear home Red and solid, come ye home. Now ladies and gentlemen we hear from Mr. William R. H. Latham, park engineer Of the Department of Parks who is representing Commissioner Moses. Annually the park department takes pleasure in Giving the city 22 Christmas trees in different parks Throughout the city. In each of the five boroughs there is a ceremony Such as this going on right now. In each of the other four boroughs the borough president Is the principal speaker of the ceremony. Here in Manhattan we have two principal speakers. The first I take pleasure in introducing Borough President Stanley Isaks. Mr. Latham, fellow citizens, I am proud of the chance To participate in this dignified ceremony Dedicating the Christmas tree in City Hall Park Which will stand here as an emblem of beauty And of peace and good will. There are some who seem to think that we should not Cut down our trees for these purposes. And they are so wrong. Our trees grow in the forests and they are used For many purposes. Some were cut down to form the lofty masts of ships In the older days. Some are cut down to furnish timber for our houses. Some have the most humble purpose of being turned into pulp That makes paper to carry the spoken and the written word. But what loftier purpose can be served by this beautiful tree That stands here than to stand forth in City Hall Park As the emblem of our real civilization. As that emblem of peace and good will. That we need to show to the peoples of this city That we are a peaceful nation. That our citizens from all lands are here living peacefully together. And that we breathe to the people of all the world peace and good will. Thank you Mr. Isaacs. I now take pleasure in presenting the mayor Who will give his Christmas message to the people. In keeping The beautiful custom. Established by the Department of Parks. The mayor joins. In extending. To the people of the city of New York. To the people of the city of New York.

A mission. Of brotherly love. Of justice. Of happiness. And of peace. Among all people. We are fortunate in this country. That we have been better able. During the last few years. To give meaning. To this lesson. We have been fortunate. In being able. To enjoy the blessing. Of peace. Of peace. But we cannot. Be fully. And completely. Happy. If there are others. In the world. Who are suffering. Because. Of war. We want to share. The happiness. Of peace. With all the people. Of the world. Of the world. And let our Christmas. Prayers. Be dedicated. To him. In the highest. For world. Peace.

The tree will now be lighted by Gene Lugardia, who will throw the large switch. Ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to the ceremony of the lighting of the Christmas trees being held on City Hall steps. They're just throwing the switch, which is in the center of a huge Christmas wreath in front of the steps. The mayor just finished speaking, and just then, the lights in this 40-foot tree with a beautiful star on top of it, overlooking the City Hall park, were just lighted. At the same time, there are 22 trees in all, covering the five boroughs of the city, all lit up at once as that switch was pressed. In Borough Hall in Brooklyn, Joyce Kilmer Park, Bronx, Kings, and the Borough Hall in Richmond Park. Mayor just posed in front of the wreath and in front of the switch with his little daughter after the pressing of the switch. And now I believe we're to listen to the Sacred Heart Boys Choir. 최대 920 No. 140 920 And that his blessed blood Has got the exultation for Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Cross the Lord Oh, give the heart with rapture gloves To greet the holy night That gave the world his Christmas rose His King of love and life Every voice of wine is late The bright, the madres' love From paradise who I became That we with him adore Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Cross the Lord Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Adore him, Christ the Lord Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Among us adore him Let us adore him Christ the Lord Lord Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him The Lord Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Who is the King of Israel Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Who is the King of Israel League club will now present O Holy Night Lord Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, come, let us adore him Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining.
