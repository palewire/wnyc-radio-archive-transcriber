Here To The End The End The End The End The End The End Soon I will be done. A spiritual is just sung by the choristers. And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Borey, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothin'. The End Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their feet at the feet, down a lock on the door, pray somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? What for? What for? What for? What for? What for? What for? I've got a lot on the door, that's the way to be. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my song, her head ends the whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got the sun, got the moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of plenty, got to pray all the day. Keep the plenty, you're not the worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of life. Never was it long as I'm well, never was it tried to be good, to be bad. What the hell, are you glad I'm the boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, for heaven's whole day long. What are you complaining? Got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Bess. The choristers are under the direction of Florence Martirosian, with Isabelle LeBori as piano accompanist. As a group with Paul Horowitz, thepolitics in the profession were a priest, after singing the facility, I hired the chimney of Florence Martirosian, that was a ninety- mommy classer. He was by the man in the family of Paris, since da Escher's face was an uncle danse country Josh Goldberg. He was aan Gog Amique Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
