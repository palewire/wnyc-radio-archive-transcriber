We hear first, The Banks of Allen Water, followed by Now is the Month of Maying. On the banks of Allen Water, where the springtime may fall, On the miller's lovely daughter, there has come them all, For it's dry, a soldier's sorrow, and a willing tongue can hear, On the banks of Allen Water, now is all day and year. The Banks of Allen Water, where the northern spread is so, There has come them all, a million children, but a smile no more. For the summer, free, and water, and the soldier falls not near, On the banks of Allen Water, now is all day and year. The Banks of Allen Water, where the winter smoke fell by, Till the streets of the miller's door, And a chilling blue-colored land. From the miller's lovely older, All from gold and careless green, On the banks of Allen Water, where the winter smoke fell by, And a chilling blue-colored land. The Banks of Allen Water, where the winter smoke fell by, And a chilling blue-colored land. il resistance Ilش Ilش OFTEN And to the black white snow, the gifs spread out their crown And to the black white snow, the gifs spread out their crown I am white and queen music, you sing the loudest music La la la la la la la La la la la la Our fed prices Jacobs La la la la la Since thismos speed Shall we pray Follow theído La la la la la La la la la la Since this rate Shall we pray Follow the Sports La la la la The choristers have sung to madrigals the banks of Alan Water and now is the month of May.

A spiritual is just sung by the choristers. And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Borey, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing And love is plenty for me I've got no car, got no mule I've got no misery The folks with their feet up and feet Got a lock on the door Pray somebody's a-goin' to run But without a-make-in-more What for? What for? I've got no car, got no love I've got no love on the door That's the way to be They can steal the rug from the floor That's okay to speak For the things that I try Like the stars in the skies are on me Oh, I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I've got my gal Got my song Her head is a-whole day long Do you complain it? Got my gal Got my gal Got my gal Got my door Got my door Got my door Got my door I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I can't the sun Can't the moon Can't the people see The folks with plenty of money Got to pray all the day He's with plenty You're not a warrior I'll keep the devil away Away, away Away I am a friend of hell In a time to ride Never want me long And I'm well Never want to strive To be good To be bad What the hell Are you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I've got my gal My gal Got my gal To heaven All day long Now you complain it Got my gal Got my gal Got my gal Got my lord Got my lord Got my lord Got my lord You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Dabst.
