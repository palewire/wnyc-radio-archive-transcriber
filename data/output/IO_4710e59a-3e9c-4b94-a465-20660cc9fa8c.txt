The Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable Vincent Impeletere, is host today to Mr. A. Philip Randolph, President of the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Mr. Whelan has just conducted the guest into the Board of Estimate room here at City Hall, and Mr. Whelan has just called for the National Anthem. The Mayor of the Constitution The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End For a 300-400-hour week in 1925, their pay has reached a minimum in 1950 of $235.90 for a work month of 205 hours. This amounts to an overall annual increase of $12,500,000. Social gains have been equally outstanding. The Brotherhood and Mr. Randolph led the movement in 1941, which brought about the establishment by President Roosevelt of the Fair Employment Practice Committee. This committee opened thousands of new industrial jobs to Negroes, a blessing not only to their race, but to our entire war effort. Again, the Brotherhood can be credited with the progress that has been made in eliminating discrimination in the armed forces of the United States. The struggle of this great labor organization has been the American struggle for equality under law, for equal rights to employment, for freedom of the individual, for the entire democratic process which strengthens our nation and protects us all. I wish Mr. Randolph and his fellow workers in the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters continued success in their efforts. I join the entire community in admiration for their courage. I pledge them my continued support and friendship. I want them to know that the people of the city of New York welcome them and are proud of the great organization that had its start here in this great city of opportunity. Ladies and gentlemen, President A. Philip Randolph. Mr. Whalen, Honorable Vincent Impelitari, Acting Mayor of the City of New York, on behalf of the delegates, members, and officers of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, we want to profoundly express our appreciation and gratitude to you both for this delightful, splendid, and unusual reception upon the occasion of the 7th Biennial Convention of our organization and its 25th anniversary in the freest and the greatest city in the world. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now the Mayor and the Honorable Vincent Pelletieri, Mr. Randolph, and the guests today are leaving the Board of Estimate Room in City Hall. The Mayor had planned a very beautiful reception outside City Hall for his guest today, but the weatherman was a rather mean person today. And as we said in an announcement here in the chamber, we hope that if the weatherman ever gets on a Pullman train, the Pullman porters will know what to do with him. Well, that's all from City Hall, this is the municipal broadcasting system. Well, that's all from City Hall. This is the municipal broadcasting system.
