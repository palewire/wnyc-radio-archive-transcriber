What is peace splitting? What is peace splitting? Well, now, peace splitting is a broad term. Essentially, it refers to what we consider in college as a dishonest practice, the financial dealing between the surgeon, the chief patient, and other doctors who may be associated in the handling of the individual patient's problems. There are many rather institutions of it, many ways that the chief may be split. There are many subterfuges that can be used by doctors who may be considered dishonest to practice this problem. There are only a small percentage of the chief of American citizens who are stooped to this sort of deal. However, it is a sufficient moment to talk about a daily of alarm and one of the problems that we have had before us for a great many years is the whole question of the division of peace without the patient knowing what is being done. Probably the most fledgling type of peace between the illustrating of equality. You are sick. Your family position is the one to whom you rely for advice. You've known him for very many years. You have confidence in him, but he may be a peace with her. You are very ill now. It is necessary for you to go through a major operation. There are many excellent surgeons in the neighborhood who can do the operation stillfully. However, your physician does not ask any of them to do this in consultation or operate on you, though he knows that they will do a good job. And he doesn't go to them because he knows that they will not, following the operation, and the payment of the bill, give him a cut of it. So he takes you to another doctor, Dr. X. He is not as skilled as the others who are but round the corner and is barely available, but somebody perhaps some distance, then it's twelve blocks away or in another town. Besides, they have a secret of arrangements between them. That, following the payment of the bill, he, your family position, will get a slice of it. 25% or 50% of the front miles. Without your knowledge, that is the discipline of many different forms in which that plan of the business can be carried out. Thank you very much, Dr. Forth. We've been speaking the past few minutes with Dr. Harold L. Forth of Danville, Pennsylvania. Dr. Forth is the new president of the American College of Surgeons. Now, this is Larry Lacer returning to our WNYC studios. This is Larry Lacer at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where the American College of Surgeons is holding its clinical congress. And here to tell us about some, one of the very important facets of work discussed here is Dr. Jerry W. Lord, Jr. of the Bellevue, NYU Bellevue Medical Center. That work has to do with an arterial bank. We've heard about blood banks. This is an arterial bank. And what exactly is that, Dr. Lord? An arterial bank is the storage of spare arteries, which may be useful in the surgery of diseases of the heart and great vessels of the proax and abdomen. The arterial bank is similar to the blood bank in that it's located in a hospital. This one is located at the New York Hospital. And as a result of the cooperative efforts from 25 surgeons here in New York City interested in surgery of the heart and blood vessels. The arterial specimens are taken from donors. In contrast to the ease of obtaining blood from individuals from the blood bank, the arterial specimens must be obtained from individuals who have recently died, preferably not from infectious or malignant disease. They necessarily must be reasonably young so their arteries are in good condition. Ideally, they are individuals who have lost their life through an accident, an automobile or bullet wound. The segments of arteries are removed under sterile aseptic conditions and are stored in the refrigerator slightly above freezing. Such specimens are available for about 30 days to six weeks and then must be discarded. At present, much research work is being done. To develop methods of storing the graft for long periods of time. One of the best methods, apparently presented to the Congress this week, is dealing with the, has dealt with the method of drying and then, dealt with the method of freezing and then drying of the graft. There are, tell me, uh, I may interrupt you there. What would you tell us, has this operation been successful? This transplant, this transplanting of, uh, arterial parts as it were. These arterial grafts have been used in the past two years in New York City successfully in twelve patients. The importance of it is that none of these operations could have been done if the graft had not been available in the bank. The added factor, in addition to the use of the grafts, is the fact that once in a while a surgeon may operate where he thinks he may need one, but the final analysis does not prove to be necessary. If the graft had not been available in the bank, however, such an operation may not have been undertaken in the first place. How may people volunteer these parts, arterial parts? Unfortunately, the individual must have lost his life, but the relatives, in order to permit the removal of such arteries, must give permission for a post-mortem examination of the grafts. Uh, promptly, because after six hours, the grafts are no longer useful to be taken. Thank you very much. We've been speaking to Dr. Jerry W. Lord, Jr. of the Bellevue, NYU Bellevue Medical Center. He's dealing with an arterial bank. This is Larry Lafer returning you to our WNYC studios. I live in general.
