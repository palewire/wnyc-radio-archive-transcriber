For cross and country, we associate ourselves together. These words, the first lines of the preamble to the Constitution of the American Legion, most appropriately serve to open this program, presented under the auspices of the American Legion and dedicated to the furtherance of its nationwide Back to God program, which calls for a spiritual reawakening in our time. The voices you hear are those of the West Point Military Chapel Choir. Presiding in these special services here in New York's Center Theater today is American Legion National Chaplain, Johnny Duffy. May our hearts be united in the singing of our national anthem. Oh, say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there O'er the ramparts we watched Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the ramparts we watched And now may I ask American Legion past national chaplain, Rabbi David Leftowicz, Jr. of Louisiana, to deliver the invocation. Today, as we recall the sinking of the troopship Dorchester, let us commemorate the courage of the four chaplains. John P. Washington, a Roman Catholic priest, Alexander D. Good, a rabbi, George L. Fox and Clark B. Poling, Protestant ministers, who united in prayer, gave their life belts and their lives on that day ten years ago in order that others might live. Let us, O God, inspired by the memory of their faith and sacrifice, discover the true meaning of a return to religious belief and practice. May our program back to God, offered in a spirit of reverence, be blessed with holy strength and purpose, and promote a spiritual reawakening in the hearts of our people, serving to symbolize for all nations and creeds the individual responsibility of free men, one to the other, in God. Amen. At the opening of our program, you heard the West Point Choir singing the opening phrases of the American Legion Preamble. We are pleased to present this stirring composition in its entirety. It will be sung by Morton Downey. For God and country, we associate ourselves together for the following purposes.

Nixon The Vice President Of these United States I know of no organization That could more appropriately Sponsor this Back to God program Than the American Legion I suppose That some of you Wonder why I would make Such a statement I make it because The American Legion Was founded By men Whose major interest Was their country The defense Of their country The survival Of their country And naturally We are concerned Today About enemies From without And the American Legion's Program of strong National defense Is therefore Understandable In the light In the light of the Objectives For which it was Farmed But if we study History We will find That more great Civilizations More great nations Have been destroyed Because of Moral decay From within Than have been destroyed Because of armed Attack From without And that's why It is essential In these days Of conflict That if America America is to survive That America's Spiritual strength Must be constantly Recreated In the minds And hearts Of the American people I wonder if All of us realize What a great privilege It is to live in America To have the freedoms That we enjoy here The privilege that it was On the inauguration Of the President Of the United States To listen to him Open his inaugural address With prayer That couldn't happen In half the world today Did you ever stop To think what a great Privilege it was For millions of Americans Today To go to the church Of their choice You say why That's a privilege We have In this country Under the Constitution But you couldn't do that In half the world Today And that's why It is necessary For us to Recognize that In this nation Of ours The spiritual Privileges that we have The right to worship Our maker Our God In our own way Is one That we must defend We must not only Defend it from Enemies from without But we must also Remember That a privilege If it is to be ours If we are to retain it Must be used And that's why This program This program Which is dedicated To getting Americans To realize What a privilege They have To worship In their own way Is so important And why it is Such a privilege For me And others on it To appear On this occasion And so Let us remember This Let us remember That In this great Conflict In which we are Engaged throughout The world today That military strength Is important The American Legion Realizes that And the American people Know it Our economic strength Is important But above all The greatest Advantage we have Over the slave world Is the spiritual strength Which should be ours And which I am sure Will be ours And is ours Under our leadership And all of us Have a part to play In creating and developing That spiritual strength Because America's Spiritual strength Is the sum total Of the spiritual dedication Of each American citizen And so I say Today Let us join With the American Legion In making America A great moral And spiritual force For good In the world In which we live The Reverend Dr. Norman Vincent Peale American Legion Past Chaplain Kings County New York The Building Of the Ship By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Thou too Sail on O ship of state Sail on O union Strong And great Humanity With all Its fears With all the hopes Of future years Is hanging breathless On thy fate Sail on Nor fear To breast the sea Our hearts Our hopes Are all with thee Our hearts Our hopes Our prayers Our tears Our faith Triumphant Or our fears Are all with thee Are all With thee The core The core The core The core The core The core The core Bareheaded Saluted With eyes up Thanking our God That we of the core Are treading Where they Where they Of the core Have trot They are here In mostly Ascendant Of the Hail Of the Hail Of the Hail And the hearts Are standing Attention Hail While we wait For their Passing Tread We Sons of Today We Sons of And Earth Yet We Follow Those Order Behind You Where you Have Pointed The Way Salute Along The Way By The Strap Shed Through The Years Of A Century Tore And The Last Man Feels To His Marrow The Drip Of Your Heart Up Home Rip Hands With Us Now Though We See Not Rip Hands With Us Strengthen Our Hearts As The Long Line Stiffens And Straight And With The Thrill That Your Presence Imparts Rip Hands Though It Be From The Shredder And We Say Your Heart For Living For Dying To Honor The Thornt And The Thornt And The Thornt And The Thornt Now we hear from our American Legion National Commander Louis K.
