Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. New Yorkers have come to City Hall Park this evening to watch one of the town's Christmas time traditions, the lighting of the city Christmas trees. During this program, taking place on the steps of City Hall, you'll hear Mayor F.H. Lagardia's annual Christmas message to his fellow citizens. And after the mayor's address, his son Eric is scheduled to press the switch that will light the 22 Christmas trees in the parks in all the five boroughs, including the 40-foot tree in front of City Hall. And now we take you to the front of the City Hall steps where we hear a musical program by the New York City Police Department, Glee Club. The Ballhead, as I understand, is the braveest team.

Ladies and gentlemen, from City Hall Park in Manhattan, we have brought you the ceremonies on the occasion of the lighting of the city's Christmas trees. During this broadcast, Mayor F.H. Lagarde delivered his annual Christmas message to the people of New York. Other speakers included Mr. William H. Latham, the park engineer representing Commissioner Moses, and the Honorable Stanley M. Isaacs, the president of the Borough of Manhattan. Also heard the boys' choir and the police department glee club. And just at this moment, ladies and gentlemen, from the 40-foot tree across the park, there appeared a vision. It's Santa Claus. And the park department band at the foot of the Christmas tree playing Jingle Bells. We return you now to our studios in the municipal building.
