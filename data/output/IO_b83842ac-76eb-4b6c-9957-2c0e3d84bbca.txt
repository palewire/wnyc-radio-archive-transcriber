Well, Bing, I would say that charity is the most gracious form of giving It is Christian giving in humility and love You have to wrap a bit of your heart around the gift to make it true charity That's a good point I'll mention that to Gary As a New Yorker, you know I'm familiar with the work of the New York Catholic Charities A great organization that cared for nearly half a million people last year Yet gave each of them the individual sympathy and compassion That you and I would give them if we were doing it in person All that was made possible by the generous Christian people of your city That's right, Bing They gave what they could Some gave pennies, some gave thousands And I'd like to give a special pat on the back to the show people of New York The entertainers They have entertained at benefits and in hospitals And in addition to their time, they've given money I'm speaking of New York because I know the grand work they've done there But the same thing is true, of course, in cities all over the United States Oh, certainly Wherever there's need, there's a Catholic charity organization to give sympathetic aid and comfort That's right, Bing And behind each of these organizations, you'll find thousands of sincere, devout persons Who give in the true spirit of charity Well, thanks very much, Fred, for all those thoughts I'll sum them up and I'll send them on to Gary Well, I wish you'd do that, Bing Well, I'd better be moseying along Where are you going? I want to make Salt Lake before midnight Oh, now, Fred, stick around a while I'm having a gang out this afternoon We're going to brand a few calves They'll be here any minute Well, I'd like to stay, Bing But I've got to get rolling, old man They may lift the water restrictions in New York soon And say, I want to be there when the swallows come back to old Manhattan Now, how to get back to the racing form Let's see, there's a little thing going today at Jamaica Ought to be about two for the good one Oh, the doorbell again Must say, the world lost a beautiful butler when Whiteman made me a crooner Well, strike up the van, Mr. Music Fancy Pants is here I'm afraid it's Bob Holt Come on in, Bob Throw your bags over there in the corner Oh, sounds, there goes my buttermilk See, Bing Is today the day of your party? Well, you got the invitation, didn't you? Yeah, but do you have to humor your sponsor that much? Send your messages by smoke signals? Bob, you never can tell about sponsors these days They're here today and TV tomorrow Bing, you have nothing to fear from television Why, right now I'm working up a television show for you and Judy Garland Oh, is that so? What'll you call it? Paunch and Judy Sit down, Bob I'll bring you a glass of larynginus or something Just lay down Thank you, Bing I've always wanted to have a voice like yours Say, we'd better work up something to do at the party They'll ask us to sing something, you know What, suppose they don't ask us? Don't be silly If they don't ask us, I'll ask us Now, what do we do? Well, how about, uh You know, Bob? Mm-hmm I know that charm and manners count But I like what you do Put it there, pal Put it there No matter what my lawyer says I've always liked you, too Put it there, pal Put it there The day you bought that baseball team It started quite a fuss They loved me so in Cleveland That what else could they discuss? But now I hear the Indians Want to give you back to us You'd call a foul ball fair Put it there Oh, by the way, that Pittsburgh team Eight team I hope it makes a go Put it there, pal Slip me some skin, huh? Drop that back in the bowl I'd more than gladly let them teach it That's me, that's me No, it's me That's me Put it there, pal Put it there Don't croon into the umpires here And hope to win a game I found a line I'm proud to be a pirate And the pennant is my aim The way you make your dough At least you live up to the name Your loyalty is so rare Put it there My colleague My crony My cohort My friend My second sacker My third base coach Chums to the end Like meat and potatoes You better lay off potatoes Boy, what a blend Don't put it in the paper Don't put it on the air I'll finish Don't put it on the shelf You got any pens of green with you? Put it there Put it there Say, that was pretty good, Bing Do you ever think about taking up singing for a career? Many times Instead of golf? Many times Especially after watching you play Say, Bob, now that you're here This boy of mine, Gary Is a part of his schoolwork He's got to write a theme About charity And I promised him A good definition of charity Could you help us out? What is charity, Bob? Well, Bing, that's a question That looks easy Until you try to answer it To me, charity is more than money Even though it may involve The giving of money Charity is the reflection Of God's love in your heart That makes you want to Share your blessings With those who are less fortunate And to do it in a way That will help them most I think I see what you mean, Bob For instance, a fellow stops you On the street and he says Can you spare a guy a quarter For something to eat? Well, you give him the two bits But that's not charity No, because most likely You did it to get rid of him That's not the spirit of charity And besides that Your quarter may not have Helped him at all May have proved to him That it's easier to mooch Than to work Exactly So to me, the best form of charity Is given to a specialized organization Such as New York Catholic Charities That'll assure you of wise Understanding and administration The kind of charity That'll help those who need it Both materially and spiritually Thanks, thanks, Bob That's very good I'll explain all that to Gary With the help we're giving him He ought to be able to write Quite a theme Ah, that must be some of the girls Girls? Mm-hmm You mean girls? Yeah Is my necktie on straight? How do you line it up With your neck or your nose? Just tell me how it's riding On my Adam's apple, that's all Go to side saddle I see No, no, now, Bob Put away your fountain pen Let's see who it is first, will you? Hello, Bing Hello, Annie It's Ann Blythe, folks Ann, you remember a zany character Named Hope, huh? Oh, you mean the one who plays Left pocketbook for the Cleveland Indians Yes, one of the head squads Yes, move over, Crosby Hello, Ann Oh, hello, Bob Say, Ann, where's the rest of your crowd? Oh, she's parking the car Over there by the corn crib The corn crib, yeah That's where Crosby stacks All his old scripts Bing, will our coats be safe in the car? Oh, absolutely, Ann My ranch hands are as honest And as trustworthy as Bob Hope Ruth, be sure and lock the car I did, Ann Well, what do you know? Ruth Hussey Well, well, Ruth Yeah, hi, Bob Are you one of the ranch hands? No, Ruth, I'm well fed Very good choice of adjectives, too But come on in, girls, huh? Are we on time, Bob? Has the party started yet? Yeah, it started 11 minutes ago Oh, when did you get here? 11 minutes ago Sit down, girls What'll you have? Oh, I'm starving Is the cook in the kitchen?

And you didn't know Right, Ruth, I didn't know So I told him to stand by Till I got a chance to caucus A few of my friends on it Now you, Ruth, what is charity? Oh, well, that's not so easy to answer Is it, Bing? I believe the word charity Comes from the Latin word caritas Meaning dearness or love So charity springs from love A love of humanity That makes you want to share What you have It's not so much giving as sharing Oh, exactly The things of this world Are not ours to give They belong to God We merely have the use of them While we're here We can't take them with us Not one tiny jewel Nor one small penny Only spiritual blessings Can be ours to keep So God gives us The happy privilege of charity As a means of sharing His earthly gifts With those who need them most Yes, either personally Or through some benevolent organization Yes, things such as The New York Catholic Charities That's right, Ann I'm an ex-New Yorker So I can testify To the wonderful work Being done by the New York Catholic Charities But that is Catholic Charity The world over That's right, Ann While I was doing stage plays In New York I had the opportunity To see those many Humanitarian services Rendered without regard To race or creed Well, thank you, Ruth And thank you, Ann I'm sure that Gary Will be greatly helped With all this material And by your words about charity Here's a song called Sure Thing Happens to be from A new Paramount picture Called Riding Hard They won't say Very quick Very quick Wasn't that jazzy The way I thought about it?
