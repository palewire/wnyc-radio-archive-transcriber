Radio and newsreels microphones are now located in possibly one of the most beautiful spots anywhere in the world. Beautiful because of their simplicity. Because we're on the terrace of Gracie Mansion, the house that Archibald Gracie bought over and adorned as his private residence after his great fleet of ships flying the well-known red and white flag, which is still a tradition on the high seas. And from that great industry that he built up from it, he became one of the grand seniors of New York City, and this house here has been the scene of many wonderful entertainments. But nothing as spectacular and beautiful as the Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, has arranged for the President of the United States today. As we're on the terrace here, this beautiful flagpole that's been one of the great accomplishments in the terrace accompanied of the Park Department and Commissioner Moses, the men of the First Army, one group holding the stars and stripes, and the other the President's flag, which in true formality will be raised here in the presence of the President of the United States and the Mayor of the City of New York. The fireboats are off there in the river sending up a rainbow, we might say a rainbow, because the cascade of water that is a miniature Niagara shuts out almost the entire view of the manufacturing shore of Astoria that used to be lined with beautiful residences at the time that Mr. Gracie took over Horns Hook here in 1799 and created the mansion from the house that Jacob Walton built in 1717. We hear the sirens in the back now, the President of the United States is arriving. In due time, you'll hear the salute of 21 guns by the First Army perched there on the hill, and a commentary might be very interesting as we look at the porch at Gracie Mansion and see the service people who will serve the luncheon lined up there in red coats. Well, we might say there was a time when red coats found it pretty difficult to locate anywhere along the East River here. We remember another distinguished situation when Mrs. Murray gave her great party, and Lord Howe had come in there at Kipps Bay and climbed up the hill. When they saw the feast that Mrs. Murray had spread before them, they said, oh, let's postpone the war for a day. And the ranking officers of the British Army enjoyed Mrs. Murray's hospitality, and Israel Putnam and the army that had had disaster there on Long Island made one of the great retreats of war strategy and secured their retreat to Harlem Heights and the Jumel Mansion further over west. Still standing is another chain in this magnificent historic recapture of our early United States and its early beginnings as the anxious 13 colonies. The President's flag is a very handsome flag. It's customary, you know, when the President is in residence in any building, a residence of any kind, or an institution, we might say. The flag is flown because it means that every precaution must be taken to guard the life of the President of the United States and to give him every facility to transact his business and be safely on his way. This comes from ancient times, ancient feudal times, because when the king arrived at the castle, the gonflon of the king flew from the highest tower, and everybody from miles around that had a view of that castle or edifice knew that the king was in residence. At that time, of course, the king was the insignia and the head of the government of whatever country it might be. The first army is drawn up here on the terrace, and we can look back on the revolutionary days when for a while even the British occupied the Gracie Mansion here. Mr. Gracie himself was a gentleman who was born in Dumfrey, Scotland in 1755. He came here to this country, country. He married an old St. George's down in Beekman Street, and after that he went to Philadelphia for a while because that was quite a shipping industry spot at the time, and New York was almost entirely bypassed in the matter of shipping and industry. Nobody then with a view could understand the possibilities of these 500 miles of shoreline that is now the great industrial port of New York, one of the greatest forces of commerce and industry anywhere in the world. And now you can hear in the background there the guns, the 21 gun salute, and just as the first gun fired, the men of the first army start raising the president's flag on the flagpole here at the terrace of Gracie Mansion. The flag is up, the president's flag is up. A man has climbed the ladder now to make the secure fastening of the president's flag, and as soon as that is in position, our own stars and stripes will be raised by another group of men of the first army. With the men of the first army lined here in parade alignment, the band of the first army is waiting to signal for whatever music will be played at the time. Here we can play the Star Spangled Banner because this is an American occasion, even though it is an outgrowth of the cornerstone laying of United Nations, which the president left left a few minutes ago down at 42nd street in the new plot there where the United Nations is receiving its new home. These planes are flying overhead, these jet planes go so fast, we can just hear the noise, we look up in time maybe to see a shadow, and the planes are gone. But the sky here, the wonderful clear blue sky, the cumulus clouds over Astoria and northern Long Island there, really the west shore of Long Island on Long Island itself, but east from here. The rainbow bridge of the railroad cross over there where by trains coming in from New England can be routed either into Grand Central or to Penn Station to go south or whatever direction the great industry and commerce might require. We're getting a little excited now because I'm receiving signals from Mr. Segal, director of the station, that the president is visible on the porch at Gracie Mansion, but we're going to remain very calm because prodigal is very strict here. The FBI arrangements have been perfect, and in just a few moments the mayor of the city of New York, the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer is now escorting the president of the United States to raise the flag on the terrace here of Gracie Mansion. And his own flag has been raised by the men of the First Army, and they're just standing at attention now for the formality of raising the stars and stripes. In the meantime, the mayor escorting the president of the United States is reviewing the troops of the First Army here on the terrace, and he seems very happy, well tanned, he's with President Romulan and Romulan of the United Nations, and now the entire First Army. So goody is out, sir. Thanks, too. Thanks, said this. Goodou. Irving Alexander You're listening to Dr. Segal but not Giansegdens Akimson You're listening to us. You're listening to Saishaka E�� The Salut Of the clerks. Dr. Segal, basically had skin contact the multitasking I saw Star Wars as a former Custom Home, and is an incredible Thank you. Thank you. The rainbow bridge there, the rainbow itself, in biblical history was a promise that the world would never again be destroyed by water. The president is talking now to one of the soldiers in line and shaking hands with him. He's going along the line, giving quite a close inspection to these men lined up here. And are they on their toes? And are they fussed with the immediate proximity of the president of the United States? What a beautiful sunny day. The exquisite park with which Commissioner Moses and the Park Department have surrounded this lovely mansion. The only previous president of the United States ever to have visited here was President John Quincy Adams. Distinguished people from all times have come here. Governor DeWitt Clinton, Fenimore Cooper, Washington Irving speaks of the place. When he was writing Astoria and the history of Astoria just across the way. We can still see a few of the old pillared houses that are left in Astoria, even though it is a shambles over there, mixed in with factories and all the industry that is part of that great section of Long Island. But everything is most picturesque today. The president now is standing and listening to the band. He is such a simple, fine gentleman in the matter of the courtesies and as one man to another. He's shaking hands with the commanding officer of the band and the troops lined up here. He's smiling and talking now to Mr. Whelan. President Romulo is going over to speak to the men who raised his flag. The four men lined up there by the terrace and now the photographers. And there he goes out to watch the naval review, I should say. Should I say naval because it's not navy? I mean the aquatic review here on the water. There goes the cascades of water again from the fireboats. And as they pick up in velocity and the water increases, the rays of the sun create rainbows where each fireboat is. And I really doubt if words can describe this scene. The clear blue sky, the cumulus clouds, and all the factors that create a beautiful landscape painting, we might say, if we tried to capture it on canvas. This cascade of water completely blocks out the industrial factors of Astoria just across the way from Gracie Mansion. And now the vice president and members of Congress are coming down to join the president. And they themselves are reviewing the East River here. A very laughable thing, there was a freight lighter coming through. And apparently the tugboat captain knew his business because he argued with the police. This was a little previous to the president's arrival. And the tide was so strong here at Hellgate that the lighter and tugboat went through. And they seemed to respect the tugboat captain's responsibility. And this lighter of freight trains went through. And it just gave us an idea of the importance of commerce and industry. President Truman is speaking to and shaking hands with each one of the men who raised the flag here, his own flag and the stars and stripes. He's just a fine gentleman visiting a neighborhood. And nobody seems to dwell so thoroughly on the qualities of friendship and neighborliness as Harry S. Truman. Complemented, it is, by Mayor O'Dwyer's own consideration for the same factors, because there's no simpler person to meet or deal with than Mayor O'Dwyer, the mayor of the city of New York, if you have any reason whatever to take up his valuable time and talk. Hello, Harry. Hello. There's Commissioner O'Brien of the police department. Police arrangements have been magnificent here today without the slightest confusion. Look at that magnificent rainbow, Mr. Siegel. Look at that rainbow over there towards Astoria, created by the fireboats. What a wonderful sight that is. The Marquis de Lafayette visited here. Louis Philip of France, when he was deposed as king, was a visitor here in New York at the time. Borough President Cashmore and Borough President Lyon of the Bronx had just come down. Controller Lazarus Joseph. There's a very interesting story that when Louis Philip was in Philadelphia, he courted the daughter of the banker, Mr. Willing, Abigail Willing. But Mr. Willing was very practical. You know, Ava Willing was married to John Jacob Astor and was the first wife of John Jacob Astor here of our generation here in New York. And when Louis Philip interviewed the banker, Willing, in Philadelphia at the time, Mr. Willing looked at him. He said, young man, he said, you are very great. If you should ever regain your possessions, you would be too great for my daughter. If you do not regain your possessions, my daughter is too great for you. And of course, Louis Philip did not marry Abigail Willing of Philadelphia. At least he treated her like a lady much better than Jerome Bonaparte treated Miss Patterson in Baltimore when Napoleon summoned him to leave the lady and come to Europe and marry a princess of Württemberg without any of the civilities of divorce even. And under these circumstances, we had the polite situation that prevailed, and Louis Philip himself went back to France and became the citizen king in one of the last kings of France in the Bourbon Line. The members of Congress, the vice president, Mr. Truman, Mayor O'Dwyer are over there now under the flag. They're having just a neighborly little visit, and Mr. Truman is starting back now under the escort of Mayor O'Dwyer to the mansion for the luncheon which the mayor has prepared for him. He's shaking hands now with the ranking officers of the Army and Navy, and all the distinguished guests who have come out here on the terrace very much impressed with the splendor of this scene. Those fireboats, what a sight they are. I'm trying to impress on you that as the spray from the fireboats increases and the mist is spread out, the rays of the sun going through it create a very beautiful rainbow. And then the rainbow bridge, that is the railroad Passover, whereby trains coming in from New England are routed through into Penn Station if they're not coming into Grand Central. Why, that Hellgate Passover is one of the feats of railroading that facilitated the transportation of freight and other, even some of the through trains from Boston that come into Penn Station instead of Grand Central go over that same rainbow bridge there over Hellgate. And so with the actual structure of the rainbow, and the rainbow created by the fireboats, and the mist and spray which they create in presenting this Niagara, it's quite remarkable. Ambassador Gerard, looking quite old and infirm, is being greeted by the President now and shaking hands with him. Remember the terrific time he had at the time of the outbreak of the First World War. Vice President Barclay now is coming along, and he's being greeted by a great many people here that know him personally and know that he represents our great country as well in the responsibility of Vice President. President Truman is walking up the red carpet that came right to the very water's edge. The Honorable Grover A. Whelan, under instructions from the Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable William O'Dryer, has made magnificent arrangements. There's a huge tent over on one of the lawns here, whereby the press and telegraph services and television have every facility under this magnificent green tent with white trimmings. The First Army Band is entertaining here on the terrace at Gracie Mansion, and certainly Archibald Gracie, at the time that he occupied this residence and spent so much time here entertaining as one of the grand seniors of New York City at the time, and from his success in the shipping industry, well, he must look down on this wonderful scene here today and feel proud that his little house, I say little, it's a mansion of its kind, it's 50 by 65 feet, but when Mr. Walton built it, a long hall down the center, with rooms on each side spacious and beautiful, and well-designed for gracious living, why then we have some idea of the... United States District Attorney McDoey is going up the steps now. What a wonderful thing he achieved there, in that famous trial there in the Federal Building. Oh God, we give thee gracious thanks for the privilege of fellowship and friendly relationship that has been ours here today in this historic place. We pray that it may be for us a symbol of that goodwill and kindly relationship among the nations of the world for which we pray. We ask thy blessing upon the government officials that are here with us, and thy blessing on this anniversary day upon the United Nations, and those who are seeking to promote this effort. We pray that it may hasten the time when peace and goodwill may abide among all nations everywhere to the honor and glory of thy holy name. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Bishop. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for a moment? We haven't any loudspeaker in this room, but we have them in all other rooms, including out on the lawn. And I should like to turn the rest of the program over to his honor, the mayor, the host of the day. Mayor O'Dwyer. Thank you, Grover. Thank you, Bishop Gilbert. Mr. President, it's my honor to present the President of the United Nations, General Romulo. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise and raise your glasses to the President of the United States. To the President of the United Nations, Mr. President, this afternoon, I have the honor to welcome you, sir, to Gracie Mansion, as I have General and Mrs. Romulo and Mr. and Mrs. Trigby Lee Mr. John DeRocqueville III, Governor Dewey, Ms. Quarren, Governor Lehman, Ms. Roosevelt, and all around me, as important a gathering of human beings as this world has ever seen under one roof. This house was graced by the presence of the first President of the United States before he was President of the United States. I have searched the records and I have found nothing to compare in importance with today. First, the visit of the 32nd President of the United States and after that, the great ladies and gentlemen whose job it is to give the world peace on a day when Trigby Lee had the hardest job in his whole life in getting that box into the cornerstone. I know the time is short. There is nothing, sir, that I can say to you except that New York told you this morning when you came how heartily you're welcome as a New York City. I can only join with that that we hope that your health and happiness will continue and one word of regret that Mrs. Truman was unable to be here. I hope you will convey the best regards of New York City to Mrs. Truman. Thank you very much. President of the United States. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mayor, distinguished guests, if I would try to call the role, I would call the role of the most distinguished people in the world. This has been a great day for me. I appreciate, Mr. Mayor, the casual welcome of the greatest city in the world, by the mayor of the greatest city in the world, and by the president of the greatest organization in the world, the United Nations. We have laid the cornerstone of the building that is to house the organization for the peace and welfare of the world. I'm sincerely hoping that the things which we anticipated for the United Nations at San Francisco and at Flushing Meadows, when they opened up there, I happen to be present on both instances, will eventually come to pass. If you remember, I always like to think of the adoption of the Constitution of the United States in 1789. We had almost exactly the same sort of troubles that we're having with the United Nations on a world basis today. In fact, it took us 80 years to find out that we could live peaceably together. In fact, we had to whip ourselves before we became conscious of the fact that we were a great nation. And then we had to fight two world wars before we found out that our position in the world was necessary for the benefit and the welfare of the world, as is the position of every other nation in the world. I sincerely hope that as a result of this meeting today, we will come closer and closer to that ideal condition which we all visualized after having been through two of the most terrible wars that ever were fought. I don't want to see another war. I'm trying with everything I have to prevent another war. All I'm working for is peace in the world and the welfare of the people of the United States and the people of all the other nations in the world. That's what point four means. Thank you very much. Thank you. I wonder if our distinguished guests would allow the President of the United States and the Governor and Mayor to leave the room with the other guests at the head table with the President and go out on the porch. There are a number of newspaper men, cameras, and others waiting out there and we must accommodate the gentleman from Washington and other parts of the Union, Mr. President. and the President must leave in a few minutes. And now the various members of Congress that accompany the President are going up the red carpet of stairway to the grand porch of Gracie Mansion. Those beautiful porches that surround the mansion on Freeside, the beautiful landscaping which Park Commissioner Moses and the Park Department have put around this old house to bring it back to its ancient glory and beauty, possibly more so than it ever actually attained. And then the engineering feat of running the East River Drive underneath the terrace which is covered with concrete and earth and a beautiful lawn and all this time right under our feet within a few feet is this terrific upsurge of traffic through the upper reaches of Manhattan on the East River Drive, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Drive and not a sound of any of it. Yes, just about 18 inches below us all this is taking place and just above us on the terrace is all this pageantry of the mayor's reception to the president of the United States. Again, we must salute the fire department and the wonderful spectacle of those fireboats and let's hope again that the rainbow promises in the reiteration here today of the fireboats themselves and the actual rainbow created by the spray, if the rainbow meant that the world would never again be destroyed by water, United Nations means that the world will never again be destroyed by war and President Romulo of the United Nations accompanying Mayor O'Dwyer and the president of the United States stood in a long, patient gaze at this wonderful scene here on the East River at Hellgate in line with the mayor's entertainment for the president of the United States. And so, I don't want to bore you with words, I doubt very much that even my words could describe the simple beauty and grandeur of this scene here today at Gracie Mansion. Because the president of the United States entered the place like a simple country gentleman and the elements of service there on the stoop, the men in their red coats that are going to serve the luncheon, the quality of it, it was hard to believe. One was in 1949 New York. We went back to the early beginnings of the 19th century when Mr. Gracie and his bride moved into this house and took up gracious living and entertaining. And the complete cross-section of the world passed through the portals of this house in the relative values of literature, arts, and all the other factors that ornament life after we've achieved the necessary factors to create it through commerce and industry. And this great harbor of New York City, which because of the Archibald Gracie's and the Michael P. Graces and all the others who have built up the navigation and the commerce and industry of this great port, well, when Mr. Gracie left Philadelphia to come to New York, it was no longer bypassed as one of the great ports of New York and under Commissioner Minetti of Marine and Aviation, we know now it is one of the greatest ports in the world with its over 500 miles of shorelines to serve commerce and industry, labor, employment, and all the other factors that go to make up your great and wonder city. And so the mayor of the city of New York has just escorted his last guest up the carpeted stairway and as a perfect host, he is ready to sit them to luncheon in the gracious beauty of Archibald Gracie's house that has been doing service and entertaining and dispensing the humanity since 1770. And this is the year of 1949. They built well because they loved their city and they were great citizens. Let us all equal that great heritage and back the United Nations, peace, industry, and commerce, and eliminate forever any quality of war or strife or misunderstanding that may ever again possibly try to raise its ugly head. That is the feeling we all have today with the laying of the cornerstone of the United Nations and with our compliments to the Army, Navy, the police, and the FBI and all the personal arrangements here today, we take a leave of you from the terrace of Gracie Mansion and return you to the studios. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System. You are... We pray that it may be for us a symbol of that goodwill and kind of relationship among the nations of the world for which we pray. We ask thy blessing upon the government officials that are here with us and thy blessing on this anniversary day upon the United Nations and those who are seeking to promote its efforts and pray that it may hasten the time when peace and goodwill may abide among all nations and everywhere to the honor and glory of thy holy name. Amen. Thank you, Bishop. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for a moment? We haven't any loudspeaker in this room, but we have them in all other rooms, including out on the lawn. And I should like to turn the rest of the program over to his honor, the mayor, the host of the day. Mayor O'Dwyer. Thank you, Grover. Thank you, Bishop Gilbert. Mr. President, it's my honor to present the President of the United Nations, General Romulo. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to rise and raise your glasses to the President of the United States. Thank you, President. Mr. President, this afternoon I have the honor to welcome you, sir, to Gracie Mansion, as I have General and Mrs. Romulo and Mr. and Mrs. Trigby Lee, Mr. John D. Rockefeller III, Governor Dewey, Ms. Graylin, Governor Lehman, Ms. Roosevelt, and all around me as important a gathering of human beings as this world has ever seen under one roof. this house was graced by the presence of the first President of the United States before he was President of the United States. I have searched the records and I have found nothing to compare in importance with today.

I hope you'll convey the best regards of New York City to Mrs. Truman. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mayor, distinguished guests. If I would try to call a role, I would call a role of the most distinguished people in the world. This has been a great day for me. I appreciate, Mr. Mayor, the partial welcome of the greatest city in the world, by the mayor of the greatest city in the world, and by the president of the greatest organization in the world, the United Nations.
