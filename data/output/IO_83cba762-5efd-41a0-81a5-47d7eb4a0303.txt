And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that a flag was still there. Oh, say does that not hang, though that I yet swayed for the land of the free and the home of the brave? This wonderful historic City Hall of New York, a few blocks from the spot where the first Congress of the United States was inaugurated when the 13 colonies formed the nucleus of what was to be the great United States of America, we greet the congressmen, 86 members of Congress and their families here in City Hall. Mr. John Coleman is chairman, and now we present Mr. Coleman. ...himself, members of the city commissioners, members of Congress, and our dear friends, we are sure you are going to enjoy your stay here with us in the city, and anything that we could do to make it more pleasant, we are at your service. At this time, I would like to introduce the chairman of the New York Division of the Congressional Tour, the Honorable Emanuel Seller, Congressman Seller. Thank you. My distinguished colleagues and officials of the City of New York, we do again welcome you here, particularly in this historic room, which is hallowed with tradition. It was in this room that Alexander Hamilton and men like Jefferson and Monroe made many contributions to the Republic in the early days of its history. We are happy to have you in the city of New York, and we hope that there will be dissipated in the minds of any of you that New York is a Sodom and Gomorrah. It is indeed far from that. New York is a splendid metropolitan city, and we are happy to have you see the glories of New York City, its historic places and museums, its fine stores, and I hope that the members of Congress have plentifully supplied their women folks so that they can go along Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue and buy some very choice articles. We are proud of our enterprises along those avenues. This afternoon, we will have the pleasure of taking you around the port where we will show you some of the needs of our port, and maybe we can move you in the direction of larger appropriations for our rivers and our port of New York. It may be that that was in the minds of those who originated the idea of bringing you into this city, but however that may be, I'm sure, Seif, that you'll find the port of New York of vast interest. As chairman of the delegation, as far as the New York contingency of Congress is concerned, I again welcome you. I hope that you did have a very enjoyable stay in the city last night, and that stay will become even progressively more enjoyable as the afternoon unfolds and evening comes on us. There are lots of high spots in New York. Some of the boys have privately asked me for some of the places where they could sojourn after the formal ceremonies of Rover, and I gave them a few names. I hope that those spots will measure up to the reputation I gave for those high spots. But in any event, I'm happy to have here with me and the other dignitaries here, another member of the New York delegation who is a favorite of all of us, and that is Gene Keogh, and I'm very happy to have Gene say a few words to you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, and distinguished commissioners of our great city departments and my colleagues and their families. I am hopeful that when this weekend will have concluded, my colleagues will understand a little better why in the upwards of 12 years that it has been my privilege to serve with many of you, I have traveled between New York and Washington approximately 225,000 miles. And I'm hopeful, too, that after you have spent this very lovely weekend that has been arranged by one of our forward-looking and progressive industrial associations in the city, that my colleagues, too, will understand the better why some of the New York members begin to become impatient when the final roll call is delayed. And I'm glad on behalf of the city that so many of our members are here, and I'm glad that they're here with their obviously beautiful and charming wives. For the people of the city will always remember that the congressional delegation that was nice enough to come and spend time with us are the same type of fine Americans that we have here in New York City. And interchanges and exchanges such as this make for a better understanding and for progress. And we're delighted, delighted that you are here, and we know that you will enjoy every minute of your weekend. And I'm happy to join with my distinguished colleague, who is also from Brooklyn, in telling you that of this great city, Brooklyn is the best. But for the general information, we still have four other counties, and we're all in one great city, Gene. At this time, I would like that great choral group, the Police Department of League Club, to favor us. And we'll be right back. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I now have the pleasure to present Mr. Herbert L. Carpenter, the Director of the Commerce and Industry Association of New York City. Mr. Carpenter. Mr. Commissioners, and the Mayor, when he comes in, it was a pleasure yesterday to welcome the members of this delegation from Washington, representing the Congress of the United States. Not only from Washington, but as I talked to your members last night, it represents probably almost the entire United States of America. It's less than 24 hours since you came to New York, and undoubtedly you've seen a great many more things interesting in our city than some of our old-time residents. We know our city too well. However, tonight afternoon, there's something very much more interesting from the Marine standpoint in view, and we hope you will enjoy that. It's a great privilege to say to you, from Washington, that the Department of Commerce of the City of New York, under Mr. Frank Donahoe, Frank Donahoe has done a magnificent job over the period in bringing to this city new industries and in radiating from this city to the other cities of the country the advantages of the city of New York and its importance. Likewise, joining with the Department of Commerce of the City of New York in this arrangement by which you can enjoy many of the fine things of our city and around it, is the Commerce and Industry Association of New York for which I have to be a director. That association represents thousands of the large and the small industries that make up the business of this great metropolitan city. We sincerely hope that you'll enjoy the remaining hours today and tomorrow at West Point and that you will not linger as long again in coming for an annual, perhaps, trip to the city of New York. We welcome you again and hope that the remaining hours will be pleasant and that you'll remain in Washington and back to your own cities all over the country remembering that we're just plain people here vitally interested in the progress and welfare of our country and that you're always welcome to the city of New York. Thank you. And now to present to the New York group, because he is so well known in the congressional tour group that came yesterday, the chairman and the general chairman of the committee, the Honorable James Van Sant, Congressman from Pennsylvania. Welcome. Thank you, Mr. Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Coleman. I feel that I speak the sentiment of every member of the congressional delegation, their wives and families. When I say that we are truly enjoying this visit to New York. But we have one in our delegation that is the general chairman of the committee, the Honorable James Van Sant, Congressman from Pennsylvania. Welcome. Thank you, Mr. Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Coleman. I feel that I speak the sentiment of every member of the congressional delegation, their wives and families, when I say that we are truly enjoying this visit to New York. I feel that we have one in our delegation that represents the great state of Ohio. Hi. I mean, Mr. Coleman, when I talked to Washington, I believe in Ohio. We 듯 became he told me when he asked you what, again, this report, about Ohio, and then due to Chicago becoming�� minute bill. participants have sent to pay attention to мі岫山 recommendation. convey to the officials of the City of New York and all the residents of this great city and state the expressions of appreciation that we have. And for that reason, I want to introduce the Honorable John McSweeney of Ohio, who will speak for our delegation. Your Excellency, distinguished officials of this great Metropolitan Center, and you my colleagues and friends, I am deeply honored today to have been selected to bring to His Excellency the Mayor our feelings on this great occasion. It is an honor when I realize what voices that have echoed from these walls to allow my humble voice to be raised in this great presence. Mr. Mayor, I want to thank you as a member of Congress for having selected our distinguished colleague, Emmanuel Seller, to represent you and to take us through your city in collaboration with that untiring, splendid worker, Jimmy Van Zandt, who has made all of these plans. Your Excellency, we realize as members of Congress that the budget for this great city is only second to the budget of the United States. We realize what a tremendous responsibility you have, and for that reason, we are deeply grateful for your giving time to us and welcoming us personally in your great city. I know all of us would like to thank you for the splendid services that your police force has given. When I heard those voices, I was quite sure that a McSweeney might not be too much in disharmony with some of those men back there. But I want to say that I am proud as an American to realize that this great city, which is the gateway to America, that you have a kindly force of 18 or 19,000 men who not only do this stringent work of maintaining law and order, but they have that kindly attitude of welcoming that person who may not speak our language, that person who has come from a downtrodden country, who has come here to stand under the folds of the stars and stars. And to raise his head and be free. I am proud of his American to find that this police force not only takes care of the unfortunate, but as I say at the same time, tries to guide and direct this great city. And so may I say on behalf of my colleagues and my friends here, I think that we are proud to be here as your guests today. And we go back to our respective states realizing what a tremendous task you have. And we offer our collaboration in making such cities and all the social problems that fall upon them a little easier for you. Again, on behalf of my colleagues, on behalf of all others, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you for the kind words. We will now hear again from the Greek public. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And you areacs for fans. Thank you. Thank you. All glory, saints of peace This is my country And of my world This is my country Grandmother of earth I pledge to my allegiance America, the foe For this is my country So am I Grandmother I am Grandmother I am Grandmother I am Grandmother I am Grandmother I am Grandmother I My They are Judges He became a practicing lawyer, city magistrate, a prosecuting attorney, judge of the county court prior to that prosecuting attorney, Brigadier General in the United States Army, and to me, one of the outstanding officials of our time, the Honorable William O'Dwyer Mayor of the City of New York. Thank you. Tallman, distinguished visitors, ladies and gentlemen, we've had many receptions to visitors in this room during the last three years, and long before that. Never have we had one with such quiet dignity, and the group who have honored us, by coming here this morning, that we need to look our city open. As a matter of fact, the gift that comes today represents the legislative body that, in this moment of history, is the most important in all the world. We are entirely aware that this group who comes to us today, in a representative capacity, are engaged in decisions at the present time that are of utmost importance to our nation, and that, just as important, is a peaceful future, to the hope in that spirit coming to a bright country and future throughout the world. So that it is in this spirit this morning, officially and personally, I will be the most important in all my heart, and no other respect over which I've decided to repent of this spirit in the past three and a half years since I came to a moment. To me, it is as important, quite as important as the one that we have the honor to receive today. Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come in our national relationship when the East should meet the West and the North and the North should meet the South. There can be no progress until we recognize the fifth instrument for which I'm speaking to you, and carry any thought that yours and mine, which is famous for your country. The other night, two weeks ago, I left here at 10th floor at night, and arrived at salt in the Calcetale Island, especially in three hours. The court ran from my mind that day and night, that the founding fathers who planned for us had no idea whatsoever that our communities, so far apart in those days, would be brought so closely that they're just labelled with common problems that how to make people live. more happy, how to build the strength that comes from the unity of our community. endless cities, or very many, where we sometimes, in a childish manner, go off into a dream of a bolstering of that thing, something that is really regrettable when it happens, because we're only big and powerful because the nation has made it to be empowered. We're the child of the nature. The people in the remotest parts of this nature have been frigidated in some way to our size. The truth is that this city that you hear misrepresented so often is eight million human beings trying to make life comfortable in a small space of 365 square miles. The greatest concentration of people in the world. Those of you who have come here for the first time and noticed our big buildings, these big buildings, tall, high buildings, are not just from the store. We could live much more comfortably if we get spread out on the ground, but you can't have room to create for eight million people in such a small space. On the ground, you've got to go up in the air to find the rooms, the houses. And here's a remarkable place. That eight million people would like to eat a few times a day. Ladies and gentlemen, we bring in from the outside over 23,500 tons of photos. And if we didn't do that every day, every day, this town would not eat. Those fox that you see, they look like nice grazing lands and you can raise a few socks on them, but our fox and mission never cost you to serve you a blade of grass in one of those fox. Believe me, they've told you there for a long time and incarcerated and raised all kinds of foxes. We don't produce one pound of food within the confines of our city. We're completely helpless and dependent upon outside communities. Eight million people have to work or to be employed. Sure enough, we give a market for the produce of the country, the mining of the country, the minerals. But, and we manufacture, but ladies and gentlemen, after the goods of manufacturing, if we have to wear the clothes or if we have to use them or depend on our market, we start to death. We have to send them back to you to buy them. And just as you at times depend upon the, uh, particularly on the outside communities, depend upon large cities, the large cities depends upon the farm communities, and the little mill and the little factory just one depends upon the other. And, consequently, when distinguished legislators in the early days of the country, will pay us a great honor by coming. It will be much more easy for us to tell the story of our people. Our people, consistent of that eight million, there are over five and a half million people in this city, in low income groups, paying less than fifty dollars a month for five and a half million people in this city. That's just the kind of simple folks that you find all over the country. Problems of housing, of rent, of schools, children getting sick, schools and school provisions, building them, equipping them, supplying them, health and hospitals. In many ways, we have a far greater problem in health than a smaller community. We have also, and you might know too as you go around, we're attempting as best we can to tear down the slum. You have no idea, unless you live in one of the muck, that means to have children born and grow up and often, those in healthy conditions, quite frankly, hardships that come from slum areas. And the great economic problem that is for the city, because we have to give much more service in a slum area than we have in a built-up modern area. Consequently, if you hear us screaming, you ladies and gentlemen of the house, you hear us down there, pleading for help in the low-cost housing scene, in the slum clearance scene, two points I hope you will bear in mind. One, we're not doing it silly, we're doing it for the purpose of making a noise. We're doing it first because we're facing a health hazard that has been handed down to us for over, sometimes as far back as 200 years, 150 years, 75, 100 years, sure. Secondly, we're doing it because we know that a modern city has to face into the future with a definite plan. Thirdly, that we are not asking for something from the federal government that we haven't ourselves done. By the end of this year, we'll have built, mostly on slum sites, 42,000 low-cost housing units. And all the money that's left to do more of that work is about $240 million. Those plans are ready to come off the planning board, and the financing is arranged, so that we're really not in a position where you can say to us when we come for you, why don't you do something about it yourselves? We recognize the need. We've done everything we possibly can do. And when you hear us in Washington, if you possibly can, pleading for federal health emergency, believe me, it isn't a selfish appeal, because we would join in exactly the same appeal for any other city to find itself in the position of housing that we are in. However, this is unfair of me to take advantage of you this morning. I apologize for that. Truth is, I wish I could be with you all day. There's a certain birthday party in the town of the Cougar just left that I have been honored with an invitation to attend, and after you leave, I'm going to watch. So, uh, you'll forgive me for that not being with you. I do hope that you'll enjoy your visit with us, and that we can find an opportunity to have the honor of welcoming you here again soon. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, General. And on behalf of Congressman Van Sant, the Chairman of the Committee, Congressman Seller, the Department of Commerce, and the Commerce and Industry Association, we speak our thanks to you and through you to the City Commissioners for the magnificent cooperation that they have given to the Committee to make this day possible. Thank you, sir. We conclude the program now. I have one request to make, that as you approach the steps of City Hall, would you please gather there in a group, and the press photographers will take a picture of the group with the mayor. Then we will go to Piray, where the boat trip will commence. Thank you, one and all. Mr. John A. Coleman acted as chairman today of the Mayor's Committee of Reception to the 86 members of Congress, their wives and loved ones, here in historic City Hall, a few blocks where the first Congress of the United States first met in this great and wonder historic city, New York, when the Congress of the United States was part of the formulation of the government of the United States, when George Washington took oath of office in Federal Hall at Wall and Nassau streets just 160 years ago. And in that 160 years, the idea, the concept of the founding fathers of this, the United States of America as a form of government, proving and assigning an inalienable right to every man, to the life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, founded in that 160 years, a method of living that is brought to a higher standard here in these United States, with all the necessary qualifications of development to reach that standard, of any nation anywhere in the world, even nations that have existed centuries previously. The Mayor of the City of New York was the host today, and you have just heard his words and remarks from City Hall in this great and wonderful historic building. We're returning now to the studios. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
