We say that right in the middle of our explanation why the radio came in and we're down here at Idlewild, New York's international airport, where a great company is assembled to combine Richmond, Brooklyn, Army and Youth Day. Just a few moments ago, a young Master DeVito took off in a helicopter and was carried over to a Scandinavian plane that will take him on a goodwill trip to Europe. And the poise of this youngster, he didn't seem to be much more than 10 or 12 years old. He was speeded on his way by Borough President Hall of Richmond. And just as the helicopter left with the youth on his way to carry the message of youth to Europe, why the other helicopter of the Navy, the Sikorsky, has just landed and Borough President Cashmore is standing at attention, receiving the salute of guns as they are taking off here with all the formalities of a great day at Idlewild. Borough President Hall has gone down to greet him and these two great boroughs of Richmond and Kings, to be more exact, but more affectionately Brooklyn, are holding forth here today in the formalities. Now there's still a few moments, the guns are still going and the President can't move while the prodigal prevails. But as soon as it's concluded, why he and Borough President Hall will come back to the speaker's stand. We'll have music by the department of, the police department rather, band and glee club. And when the time comes for the anthem, with distinguished artist singing as well, Marjorie Fabregas, and then the regular order of program, the formalities of these two Brooklyn, these two boroughs rather, we're not entirely all Brooklyn, just part. And the Borough of Kings, more affectionately as I said Brooklyn, will take over. And the guns are still going off and the Borough President has to stand there until all the prodigal formalities are finished. We're having a lot of fun here at Idlewild. We're demonstrating the facility of aviation with the calmness and ease with which this Sikorsky, Navy Sikorsky, dropped here on the ground right in front of the speaker's stand on a space that is not much bigger than the ordinary extension roof of a private dwelling. We conducted that fine exhibition of communications and their facilities from the Herald Tribune plane a little previous to that. And the air factors of the show here today have been very interesting. And if that gun ever stops firing, we'll have some other kind of a program as well. And now, Groveray Whalen has conducted his guests here to the stand, and it'll only be a few moments now while felicitations and greetings are going on here at the speaker's stand before we present Mr. Whalen. This wonderful air show here today at Idlewild and every day this week, despite prevailing ceilings, why, they've put on wonderful demonstrations. Those jet planes, despite low ceilings, they've done some very remarkable flying, breathtaking flying, in fact. And then we've had all the dramatization of Coast Guard rescue work with the various types of helicopters. In fact, every way that aviation may be adapted to the present-day situation, why we've had that demonstration. Our host, Mr. Whalen, is very anxious that the police department make arrangements for the public to come in and occupy the seats here in the boxes and reserve sections here. He wants everybody to sit down and take a seat, and he knows that the police department, in their own smiling, efficient way, will manage this and permit the people to occupy these seats here. Mr. Whalen requests that his guests be seated so that they may enjoy this program here today. What do you want, Eddie? Yeah. Well, just to show you that the police department is always alerted, Eddie Dillinger now tells me that they're ready to give us some music before we start the regular formalities because all the neighbors from Brooklyn and Richmond are shaking hands and saying hello. So we'll listen now to the police glee club while they consistently sing Jubilee. Five you're ready toРИ, hive-fenяжet didn't listen um, five to sixpies, and we're thankful for the many blessings that we've got. jubilee of the city of new york 50 years and we have really gone a lot

police band under captain eugene labar and eddie dillon conducting the police glee club in the formal features of this ceremony and a fine young lady will sing the anthem when that time comes mr

brooklyn and queens in the celebration here today at idle while today is brooklyn uh richmond and uh army and youth day and as we said for the benefit of those who may have tuned in a little late on the program just as one helicopter took off with a youth from the borough of richmond uh god speeded by the borough president borough president hall speeding on his way to europe where a plane of the scandinavian airlines was waiting just across the field to take him from the helicopter the navy helicopter the sikorsky with borough president cashmore aboard alighted here at the field and i'm telling you if this keeps up much longer none of us will use any other transportation but air we've had such a concept of speed tremendous speed here and the demonstrations of air facility have been so great at idle while that we feel that everybody from now on in new york will be air minded and now i believe mr whalen our genial and competent host the man who knows more about organizing a great demonstration to properly put forward the city of new york in its best aspects is waiting now and we have the distinct privilege of presenting the honorable grover a whalen thank you mr cowan there's nothing like having a competent announcer to introduce you and tommy does that so well here that i'm sure that all those who have had the great pleasure of hearing him will agree with me that he does a swell job for our great municipal station wnyc this is as you know or was to be before the elements interfered richmond day and richmond very generously waived its sole right to the occupancy of this platform to brooklyn and of course as you all observed a few moments ago the borough president of brooklyn the honorable john cashmore did not come the way of all we folks but arrived in a helicopter he had read of the assimilated rescue that we had the other day that unfortunately had an accident and he was hoping for a similar experience i'm sure i hope you also heard i think it was the 86 guns that saluted the president upon his arrival he told me that if he had a brooklyn policeman here he would have ordered the arrest of the gunner because he had not received a permit from the president of the borough of brooklyn he said there are presidents and presidents and of course i'm not going to let him do anything to richmond because it's a uh an island separated from the mainland but mr president of the borough of brooklyn john cashmore may i say to you that is the chairman of the mayor's committee for the commemoration of the golden anniversary that you were a stalwart in the belief that this great international air exposition could be successfully planned and carried out and i'm sure that last saturday when you were here when the the eyes of the world were upon us that we proved successfully that your judgment was correct and i wish to take this opportunity to thank you personally for what you have done in connection with this great operation as well as the borough

hearing in a few minutes I do want to say very briefly This great airport is going to mean much to Brooklyn It's only one eight and one half miles from Borrow Hall That's a fairly short drive by car But only a few minutes ago I think I proved this Brooklyn and Idlewild Are really next door neighbors They are no more than a few minutes flying time apart That's how close they'll be in the near future When flying becomes as commonplace as riding in our subways Or taking a trip by automobile Our program this afternoon Is really a four-in-one ceremony Last Tuesday was supposed to be Brooklyn

Richmondites One thing You may be small in size But you are represented in our board of estimate By a man Who knows how to act With grace and humility On certain occasions And when force And eloquence

Courtney Hodges Is unable to be with us today He had a speech ready For our Brooklyn Army Day program Last Tuesday Because of the rain The whole program was postponed Today The War Department Has a special assignment of its own For General Hodges So he is represented By Major General Roscoe B. Woodruff Deputy Army Commander General Woodruff Won't you please stand up And take a bow General Woodruff You and I know That there's only one band In the city of New York So without further ado Let's hear from the police department band In a musical salute To the United States Army Which one is this? This us? All right Hang on a side This us? 2yi And be here This isEE WEYAAN BUTTWOA The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End It comes to you through the grace of God. But having faith, you can grow in it. For faith is something which is nourished and strengthened by practice and use. You can generally recognize a person of faith by his or her self-reliance and confidence. Faith makes an individual one to stand on his own feet. The end, a citizen who has faith, who has faith, who has faith, who has faith and has a great job in the world. He goes out and cheerfully works for his living. He knows that hard work and skill in any station of life will bring their own reward. He wants to call forward, he wants to turn the true disagree feelsPlus HeQises and other human ofב� salutary in his own right now in the Balkans, the Near East and the Middle East. They can speak of famine and disease and the dangers of the misuse of atomic energy. But even if we are realists and recognize that there is much evil in the world, there remains plenty of cause for optimism. After all, right has triumphed over wrong in the greatest war in all history. The dignity of the individual has been upheld against evil forces that tried to drown him in an unthinking mass. The potentially strong United Nations has replaced the weak League of Nations. There has been amazing recent progress in medicine and the application of science to industry and the creation of more comforts for more people. Even the strikes, serious though they may be, cannot be called strikes against oppression and poverty. They are strikes to get for millions of people the highest income that labor has ever received. Looked at from this angle, the life ahead of us is life in a fascinating world. It is life in a world rich in custom and tradition, but a world also of progress, of change, of development. Almost I am tempted to agree with the wise old man who said, Ah, youth is a wonderful thing. What a pity to waste it on children. By all means, let us be open to change, but not to change merely for the sake of change. It is just as foolish to try to change things merely because they are traditional as it is to hold on to views simply because they are traditional. One must learn to judge each case on its own merits. When change obviously means improvement, then change is in order. Otherwise, it is better to cling to the tried and true. And now for our last point, namely the matter of friendliness. Have you not found that people usually react towards you exactly as you approach them? Most of the people whom we meet in life are good and kindly people. Oh, some have poorer manners than others. Some are more aggressive than others. Some are less helpful than others. But most of them want to do that which is ethically right. And always remember that your own good breeding is the best safeguard against other people's bad manners. And now, in closing, let me repeat my hope that we may all grow in faith, be optimistic of the future, and be friendly to our fellow men. Then will we earn the pride of our city, the gratitude of our country, and the blessing of God. Thank you, Dr. Lansom. The famous Police Department Glee Club will now take over for a few minutes.
