Modising Modising Modising Mod Dream Mod playing General Marshall, Mayor Impeletere, Director of Civil Defense, Arthur Wallander, members of the Department of Defense and fellow workers of Civil Defense. This is a most unusual occasion. We are honored by the presence of one of our most distinguished Americans, a statesman, a soldier, and at present, not only a general of the Army, but also the Director of Civil Defense, of the Department of Defense. General Marshall has devoted his entire life to his country, and all of us that are present in this room are indeed privileged to be here. General, our job in this particular phase of Civil Defense is to coordinate recruiting and public information and to recruit one million volunteers. This in itself is a stupendous task, and it represents that one out of eight persons in our population must enroll as volunteers if we are to be successful in the assignment which has been given to us. Your presence here this afternoon will be heard not only in America but all over the world and particularly in New York City where we are assured now that you have, after you've been so ill recently, to come here and honor us by your presence here. I have no words that I can find adequate enough to introduce to you, introduce you to the, my fellow volunteers, and I've asked his honor, the Mayor, if he would do that very gracious and very wonderful piece of work for the Civil Defense of the City of New York. Mayor Impelteri. Thank you. Grover Whelan, Secretary Marshal, Commissioner Wallander, members of the military and naval forces of the United States, and today particularly to you ladies and gentlemen who have come here to cooperate with your city, your state, and nation in volunteering for the very important job of civil defense. As the Mayor of the City of New York, of course, I'm very pleased and very happy today that Secretary Marshal has taken time out from a tremendously busy schedule to come here to the City of New York and to indicate by his very presence the fact that the government of the United States is vitally interested in the problem of a proper civil defense organization. those of us selected by you to lead them in the government of the City of New York are naturally very anxious to cooperate to the fullest extent with all of our governmental officials in preparing our city and in preparing our city we necessarily prepare our state and prepare the nation in achieving what our government wants in the way of a proper type of civil defense organization. So today General as the Mayor of the City on behalf of all the people I am privileged to represent I want to thank you sincerely in my own behalf but particularly on behalf of all the people I represent when I say to you that we're very pleased and very happy very appreciative of your presence here today to swear in these volunteers of our Medical Emergency Division General Marshall has devoted a lifetime to the service of his country back in World War I he served with the American Expeditionary Forces overseas he served as aide to camp to General Pershing in World War II he again was in the forefront serving as the commanding officer of the United States armies throughout the world but his service to his nation has not only been in the field of military achievement his fame throughout the world is equally important if not more so as a distinguished statesman he served as the personal representative of President Truman in China with the rank of ambassador you all know that for two years he headed up as president the American Red Cross when war clouds threatened he was again drafted back into service by President Truman and today he appears before us as secretary of defense charged with the most important job that I can possibly think of in all of the United States of America I've only recited some of the most important types of public service that General Marshall has given to the people of the United States for all of which we are deeply appreciative and very thankful as Americans one of the things he did and which he really fathered was the plan that bears his name the Marshall plan and I as one American think that it had not been for the planning of Secretary Marshall in inaugurating initiating and actually following through with the Marshall plan Europe today might present a completely different picture it was his foresight that started the Marshall plan and I think all thinking Americans today give full credit to Secretary Marshall in having developed that Marshall plan and seeing to it that it was carried through Secretary Marshall I think that that will go down in history in my judgment as one of your most outstanding achievements ladies and gentlemen thank you for your presence and it's now my very great pleasure and my great honor to present to you Secretary Marshall Mr. Mayor thank you very much I'm very glad to be here I didn't realize quite how much of an occasion this was to be on the happier that I was able to come you're starting something of course which is of very great importance you're getting organized and that is that appeals to me whatever you're going to do that you're actually getting organized and you're the beginners you're the first volunteers we all don't know exactly how these things will develop because this reaches a state these days of such forbidding futures that we can't do too much to prepare ourselves against any type of emergency that might arise and of course here you're in the greatest city in the world for that reason the necessity for organization is all the greater and I'm quite certain that it'll be well done and it'll serve as a model for other cities throughout the United States so it is a very important thing you're beginning here and I'm glad to be a small participant in this initial phase I don't want to absorb your time by any gentle expressions of mine you all are familiar with the critical period we're going through I might say that so far as the military forces are concerned the defense department that we're well underway given a little time now we'll have the affairs established on a broad base from which we can go with great rapidity in any direction and to any degree that may be necessary I want to see this organization develop in a practical sober-minded determined matter fashion I should say it's a period that appeals to the emotions and those are necessary to it but I would ask that you be very wise and thoughtful in your procedure and develop some method that will do the most with the least general disorganization of your civil life that's the approach I think we all must make to this situation I'm not thinking now of the pleasures the luxuries I'm thinking of the civil life that is essential to this democracy I will ask all the volunteers to please stand and to raise their right hands and repeat after me as I read mentioning their own names I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter and I do further swear or affirm that I do not advocate nor am I a member or an affiliate of any organization group or combination of persons that advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force or by violence and that during such time as I am a member of the office of civil defense of the city of New York I will not advocate nor become a member or an affiliate of any organization group or combination of persons that advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force or violence so help me God you're now members of the civil defense organization of the city of New York the government of the government of the government of the government and the government of the government of the government thank you very much secretary marshal will all of you please remain seated until the secretary passes out thank you very much the news ria the bill pretty honest you
