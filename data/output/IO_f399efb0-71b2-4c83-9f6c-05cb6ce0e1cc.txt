Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange Mayor Impoletari, it is my distinct honor and privilege today to present to you and through you, to the people of the city of New York, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of Genoa, Italy. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the mayor and the citizens of Genoa, on that occasion, made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has, on many occasions, proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. May the cause for which you have made our lives, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. May the cause for which you have made our lives, may the people of the city of New York. May the cause for which you have made our lives, may the people of the city of New York, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the city of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy, not only in Italy, but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the city's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the city of New York for your services for mankind. Thank you. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. And now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa.

I z Là are the first two feet and the notch I am Varlyn for his condition as a man. I line with AJ is to be brought. There is these habits and the nature of re Rouge U My God appearing to play the tribunal and everyone is Ambed for them to be prove them for people's sake. There are facts that are all him there with Christmas, they're a любовь and art without respect for them. But there are some things that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Europe and is coming to my city, she did not have only made a cordial visit to all of us. She also gave her homage to the city-mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Genova ambasciadora of democracy. That democracy is so expensive to the United States, but that is so expensive, so expensive to the Italians, especially the Genovese. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, for which every citizen of American, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come she has been able to come to the city. She has been able to come to the city, as she has been able to come to the city. So this is my visit, not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit is my visit to the city of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and to his mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. It is, above all, the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic life and has contributed to the rest of the United States and the United States, it is, above all, the great people of the United States and the great people of the United States, the great people of the United States, the United States, which we are deeply grateful for, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made, for us to give us the democratic democratic libertarian, when we have intervened so much in the war and to protect them today, with many sacrifices material and of men and of men, so that today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the world in all the world. And, well, onorevole Imperiteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work, because the democratic democratic freedom is really being established in the world and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For sometimes we Italians don't understand it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just when we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We were lost in the city of Città-Care, territory in which our work could be exploited, misery and ruin, but the attack of this force, this democratic democratic freedom was so alive that we had taken our work. We worked, we worked, we worked, we worked, we worked, and we worked for moral and materiality our country. It is with these sentiments, onorevole Imperiteri, that I salute you and the city of New York, and tell you that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of democracy in the country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genova. The tenacity of Colombo in searching your land is an example of all the Genoveses. The man who was not credent, was not believed by every man and the events of all the men, this man knew that this great land existed and looked at it desperately, and looked at the mountains and looked at the mountains, and looked at the estuary, everywhere, and looked at the path he wanted to find the world under the Christian cross, and not matter if he found the path, if we have no one of them found the path, if we have to persist, others will find the path, the path for everyone to be free in peace and in the work. Thank you. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genovese, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York, and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for, and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us. And we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy, with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps it didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
