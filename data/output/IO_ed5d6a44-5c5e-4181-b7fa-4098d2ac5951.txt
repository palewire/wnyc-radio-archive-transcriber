Mr. X. Harrison, Miss Lily Parler, curtain time. Lily, are you daydreaming? Oh, I wish plays would be going on in every corner of the world just at this moment, just for children who've never seen a play. Oh, you're thinking about UNICEF? Well, it's good to know that millions of needy children everywhere know the United Nations cares about them through UNICEF, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. Maybe they're being inoculated against tuberculosis or getting some extra food every day. Curtain time, curtain time. That's our cue, darling. And now, darling, instead of playing such a naughty witch in Bell Book and Candle tonight, why can't you turn us into nice packages of penicillin and shoe leather labeled UNICEF? That's not so far-fetched. Everybody can do that and more by sending a contribution to UNICEF, care of the UN Children's Fund Committee, New York 16, New York.
