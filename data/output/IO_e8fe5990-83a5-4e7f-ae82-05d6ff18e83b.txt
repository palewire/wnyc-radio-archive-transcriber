The Polish nation celebrates today an important anniversary. On May the 3rd, 1791, the Polish Parliament passed a new constitution, which was based on the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizens and also was in spirit of the Constitution of the United States. George Washington declared when hearing about the new constitution that Poland, by the public papers, appears to have made large and unexpected strides toward liberty. Edmund Burke greeted the new Polish constitutional law with the words It possesses a value of no mean importance to the progress of mankind. Thus, the anniversary of May the 3rd constitutes not only a Polish national event, it is also an important date in the history of the modern world. Nations like men have their ebbs and downs. The glorious past of my country has been only too often tragically overshadowed by sufferings and sad experiences. Twice in our history we lost our independence. Twice we struggled successfully and regained it. But we never, never faltered in the deep belief that good is stronger than evil. The Polish nation has exactly the same right to live within its frontiers independent as have all the other nations of the world, great or small. The Polish nation has also helped us survive the terrible years of Nazi occupation. We lost 6 million people. Only 24 million of us survived. But Poland is free again. And she celebrates again, as an independent state, the great anniversary of the great Polish constitution. We still, however, have to rebuild our homes. We have before us the enormous task of reconstruction and rehabilitation of our woe-shuttered country. But when this task will be accomplished, then again we shall serve not only our own cause, but the moral and material cause of whole mankind, of the whole family of democratic nations. And when thinking or speaking on Poland, never forget the truth of the words of our greatest poet. Like smouldering lava, our nation is cold on the surface, stiff and brittle. Yet the centuries have cooled but little the fires within her. Thank you. lifespandır. I hope this will stop.
