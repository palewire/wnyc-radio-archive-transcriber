We're not proud of them. In the last six or seven years, we've had no school. We came into a post-war period, ladies and gentlemen, and found ourselves obliged to build, in my four years, 50 new schools. That's a lot. I'll ask you to see our public hospitals, not with any pride in them because they're old and they need to be renovated, and they're inadequate as to size, and there are people in the corridors of those hospitals when they should be in wards or taken care of in a better way. But what are we to do? Leave them in the vacant lots or leave them at home unattended? We do the best we can. You can't touch a piece of ground with a magic wand and overnight get a hospital. But we'd like you to see what we're trying to do. We'd like you to ask us questions about our program and where we're going. Because this is a city of little people. They're the ones that pay for it. They're the ones that have established the need for it. We'd love to have you visitors to the city know us better. You won't find as many smart-alecks in this city as you think, but you'll find an awful lot of people that are exactly like your neighbors at home, with the same problem. Let's go.
