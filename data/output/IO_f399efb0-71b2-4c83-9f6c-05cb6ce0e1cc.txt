She has also made an homage to the city-mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, on the other hand, is also made to Genova ambassador of democracy. That is so expensive to the people of the United States, but so expensive to the Italians, especially the genoveses. For this, on the other hand, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, for which every American citizen, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come she has been able to do with the city. So, this visit, this is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, the Hon. Impeliteri. This visit, this visit, this visit, is the salute of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and his mayor, who has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. This visit, this visit, this visit, of the United States and the people of the United States, and that has contributed to it, to the rest of the people of this country, and this visit to the United States and the great people of the United States, and to the United States, which we are deeply grateful, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made up to rid ourselves of democratic libertades when intervened so potent in the war, and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men, so that today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of the democracy, and have operated intelligently, because we can defend the democracy in Europe and really defend it in the world. And, Hon. Impeliteri, Hon. Impeliteri, Hon. Sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work, because the democratic libertad is really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy, our goal. Forse, sometimes, we Italians don't understand it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is happened just in the moment when we were gravated by the weight of the confliction. We were lost in the city of Città-Care, territory in which our work could be exploited, miseries and ravines, but the attackment of this force, this faith democratic democratic was so alive that we had taken our work. We worked, we worked, we worked, we worked, we worked, we worked, we worked for moral and material to our country. It is with these sentiments, Hon. Impeliteri, that I salute you and the city of New York, and I tell you that we are tenacious in the work of the democracy in our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genova. The tenacious of Colombo, in search of your own land, is an example to all the genoveses. The reason, not credible, contrasted by every man and the events of all, this man knew that this great land existed, she was sought, and she was sought to seek trials, he had strength in the Hempines of the mountains and finished everywhere, he wanted to seek the passage that he intended to own in itsitto. The whole world can lead to the peace! Even if he was thankfully hidden not if our own place has found the passage, whether that every one of us should have been established, If the man has to persist, he will find the way. The way to make everyone free, in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to general, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
