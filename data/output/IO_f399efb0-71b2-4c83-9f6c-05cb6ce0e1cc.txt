It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the Chief Executive of the City, wherein Christopher Columbus, the Discoverer of America, was born. of America was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Your services for mankind. Thank you, Mr. President. Mayor Impelitari is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and bowing and bowing and bowing and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Vittorio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. The mayor of Genoa. Thank you. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it is with profound commotion that I have listened to your words affectionate and cordiales regarding my modest person and regarding my noble city that I have here the honor to represent. There are facts and acts that are made by men and every act that man has a unique meaning, but there are facts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Honorable Impiniteri, is come to Europe and is come to my city, she has not only completed a visit of cordiality, but she is also proud of us. She has also made homage to the city of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the recognition of the genovese so connected to the land of America. But she, Honorable Impiniteri, is come to Genova ambassador of democracy, of democracy that is so expensive to men of the United States, but so expensive to the Italians, and especially to the genovese. For this, Honorable Impiniteri, we are grateful for that she is a testimony and document of the democracy that is in the United States for which every citizen of American, independent of its origin and social class, can be able to come she has been able to come to her, as she has been able to come to her, to the high level representative of the city. So this is not only a response to my visit, not only a response to my visit, Honorable Impiniteri, this is my visit to the city of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and to his mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. As for now, this is the report of divina who belongs to the democratic empire of the United States. An argument of the Italian democracy inplicitучica to Magicazione Usted is writing this gospel of opening choices as a golden passed user, A very говорит me, as an Katherineus, at the universal democracy is uterine, These people who have backed by the law are profoundly thankful, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to give us the democratic libertarian when we have intervened so potent in the war and today we have been protecting them with many material sacrifices and men so today we can say that the United States have taken the world the democratic democracy and have operated intelligently because we have to defend the democracy in Europe and really in the world and well, on the impenetra, on the sindaco of New York it is with this faith that we work because the democratic libertarian freedom is really estes to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone it is not easy to do for a few times we are not understanding we have to remember we have to remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just in the moment when we were gravated by the weight of the competition we have lost we have lost we have lost we have lost we could have been able to work we haveThis is not this programa we niecalistic It is with these sentiments, on the other side, that I salute you and the city of New York. And I tell you that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of the democracy in our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in searching for your own land is an example to all the genoveses. The tenacious, not credulous, contrasted by every man and the events of the world, this man knew that this great land existed and looked at it desperately. He went to the river and looked at the river and looked at it everywhere, looking at it, looking at it that he wanted to find the world to join the Christian cross. And look, of course, who have found the side. It isuses to persist through the path if the chacun has found the way Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the Mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great man which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
