the country And today marks the beginning Of a new phase In the history of the service In the city of New York A completely modernized Revenue service structure Is being completed here And elsewhere throughout the country To keep the service Fully abreast Of its far reaching responsibilities One of the changes In the reorganization Is that from now on The New York City offices Of the service Are to be manned wholly By civil service personnel Ability Integrity And application to duty Are the cardinal tests For employment And promotion In all positions In the service Conversion Of internal revenue operations To a career service Was authorized By the President's Reorganization Plan Number One Of 1952 New York City Is the second area In which the plan Has been placed In effect Reorganizations Will be completed In other areas Of the country Within the next few months I am glad That so many citizens Of New York Have gathered For this installation Ceremony Their attendance Shows they appreciate The importance Of what is taking place Here today The reorganized Internal revenue offices In the city of New York In this district Will provide more convenient And faster service To all New Yorkers Who have federal tax business To transact The greater part Of the public's transactions Of federal tax matters In New York City Will be carried on Through the offices Of the three directors Of internal revenue Who are being installed Today For upper Manhattan Lower Manhattan And Brooklyn The responsibilities Of the directors Of internal revenue Correspond to those Of the former collectors Of internal revenue Except that the directors Are under civil service Additional revenue services Will be installed In each of the directors Offices Including audit transactions Heretofore performed By revenue agents In charge To streamline The administration Of internal revenue Operations A district commissioner Will supervise revenue Operations In the city As a whole Formerly there was No counterpart In the revenue service For this position The three directors Of internal revenue Are responsible To the district commissioner He in turn Is directly responsible To the office Of the commissioner Of internal revenue In Washington These straight And clear lines Of authority And accountability Will help ensure More efficient service To the taxpayer For the present At least There will be no change In the locations Of any of the internal revenue offices With which New Yorkers Are accustomed To do business But eventually The bureau Of internal revenue In order to promote Efficiency And convenience For the taxpayer Plans to bring together In one location The offices Under the jurisdiction Of each Of the three directors Of internal revenue The district commissioner For New York City Who assumes His responsibilities Today Takes charge Of an area Of exceptional importance In the field Of public service This area Is of greater importance Than most people realize For in the fiscal year 1951 Its people And business concerns Accounted for almost 15% Of the internal revenue Collections For the entire United States During the calendar year 1951 alone This area Produced 8 billion 400 millions Of dollars Of internal revenue Collections Including such sums As 3 billion 200 million Dollars In corporate Income And profits Taxes And 4 billion Of dollars Of individual Income And employment Taxes The work Of the internal Revenue offices Here Does not end By any means With the collection Of income taxes During 1951 For instance 128 millions Of dollars In alcohol taxes And more than 80 millions Of dollars In retail Excess taxes Were collected Excise taxes Were collected Here In one year This area Is now Processing Over 6 million Corporate Individual Payroll And other Federal tax Returns Returns Simplification Of all Federal tax Paying And tax Collecting Processes Was a major Goal In the preparation Of the revenue Service Reorganization Plan This goal Has been achieved In many Important Respects Prior to the Reorganization Reports Went to Washington From New York City Went through The offices Of three Collectors Three internal Revenue agents In charge An appellate Staff A regional Finance office A special Agent in charge And a district Supervisor Of alcohol Tax division That was a Total of Ten lines Of authority And responsibility In daily Operation Now There is But one Line From the District Commissioner To his Washington Superior Our fixed Purpose Is to Eliminate As many Complexities For taxpayers As is Possible New York City Taxpayers Will find That with Authority Lodged In the Local Offices To deal With a Great Many Problems Formerly Referred To Washington The Compliance With Federal Tax Laws Has Been Tremendously Simplified Under The District Commissioner The Assistant District Commissioner For Intelligence Has very Important Responsibilities Under his Direction There will Be Intensified Efforts To see That every Fraudulent Attempt To evade Federal Taxes Will bring Quick Investigation And action The task Of fighting Tax Frauds Never Was an Easy One In recent Years The criminal Element Has attempted Tax evasion With greater Persistence Than ever Before It is our Determination That this Persistence Of tax Evaders Will be Met By the Special Agents Of the Revenue Service With even Greater Enforcement Activity And prosecution Last year Additional Taxes And penalties Resulting From tax Fraud Investigation In this Area Amounted To approximately 75 million Dollars This activity Will be Stepped up Under the Direction Of the Assistant District Commissioner For intelligence To the Full limit Of available Manpower The fact That the Reorganization Plan Makes Possible A more Thorough Audit Of all Types Of returns Will have A direct And forceful Effect In the War Against Tax Dodging The Plan Is a Forward Step In Government Streamlining Operations Pinpointing Of Responsibility And the Improved Business Methods And Procedures It Embodies Assures The Revenue Service Of a High Degree Of Efficiency The Independent Inspection Service Of the Bureau Of Internal Revenue Which Will Maintain A Biggerous And Thorough Check On The Revenue Service Offices And Employees Will Be Represented In New York City District By A Chief Inspector The Inspection Service Will Be Directly Responsible To An Assistant Commissioner Of Internal Revenue In Washington The Reorganization Plan Has Features That Will Stimulate High Morale Among Revenue Service Personnel Extension Of The Merit System Throughout The Service Will Help Develop Great Efficiency And Loyalty Among The Bureau's Employees Promotion Opportunities Are Being Broadened Throughout The Field Service It Is A Significant Fact That The Reorganization Of The Revenue Service Has Been Accomplished Through Six Years Of Intensive Study And Effort It Was By No Means A Quickly Conceived Plan It Becomes Evident It Became Evident To Me Shortly After I Became Secretary Of The Treasury In 1946 That The Revenue Service Had Suffered Severely Due To The Conditions Under Which It Had To Expand Under Wartime Restrictions And Developments There Had Been A Great Increase In The Number Of Tax Returns Filed And The Amount Of Revenue Collected Many Expert Employees Had Been Called Into The Armed Forces New Tax Legislation Had Been Inactive The Workload Had Increased Enormously And The Bureau Had Not Been Able To Modernize Its Operations Due To Shortage Of Up-To Date Equipment We Immediately Set About To Improve Management Methods And Achieve Greater Operating Efficiency But Every Change Had To Be Made Without Interrupting The Services Continued Task Of Collecting Revenues And Enforcing The Tax Laws Conferences Were Held With Many Groups Of Revenue Officials As Early As October 1946 To Discuss Problems And Suggest Solutions A Work Simplification Program Was Set Up As A Means Of Enlisting The Aid Towards Improved Efficiency Task Forces Of Key Officials Were Established To Make Specific Surveys And Reports Congressional Recommendations Were Given The Closest Attention A Firm Of Management Engineers Was Employed To Analyze Operations Of The Service And Suggest Other Improvements The Alcohol Tax And Tobacco Tax Divisions Of Years We Have Gradually Reorganizing The Bureau Of Internal Revenue Until We Have Reached This Final Step In A Long Series Of Actions Taken By The Treasury Department To Improve And Streamline The Federal Tax Collection System The President's Reorganization Plan Number One Of 1952 Is The Capstone Of This Progressive Development In Placing The Plans In Effect We Have Made It Our Objective That Only The Most Capable Persons Available Would Be Named To The Positions Of District Commissioner Of Internal Revenue Director Of Internal Revenue And Other Supervisory Post To Accomplish This End I Set Up A Selection Board Made Up Of Top Career Officials Of The
