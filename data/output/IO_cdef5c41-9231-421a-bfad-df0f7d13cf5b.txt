Save, save, save, save, save, save, don't let it run, don't let it run. Water's precious as gold today, and no one ever throws gold away. So save it all for a rainless day. So save, save, save, save, save, save, save, save, stop that leaf, stop that leaf. Saving water is up to you, if you don't do it, the city's through, and that's the finish for me. And you so save, save, save, save.
