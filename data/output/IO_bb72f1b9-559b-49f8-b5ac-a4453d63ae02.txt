We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. The Municipal Broadcasting System presents Created Equal, the stories of the men and women of all countries and old ages who have done their work that mankind might move a little further on the road towards civilization. Today, Created Equal brings you the life story of one of the world's great artists, a painter who put on canvas the joy and the brilliance, as well as the terror and loneliness of life. Vincent van Gogh, written especially for radio by Maxwell Rollo-Den and Richard Pack, directed by Mitchell Grayson and featuring Joseph Julian, famed radio actor as Vincent. Created Equal presents the life of Vincent van Gogh. The Municipal Broadcasting System Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Anton, you should have seen his face when the students spoke about it. And where do you hope you get your appointment, we said. And his eyes got a dreamy look like a picture postcard saint. And he says, I do not care where the committee sends me so long as I can do good and can help the people. Ha ha ha ha ha! Like that he said it. You know that rough voice of his? So long as I can do good work. Can you imagine what would happen if the theological committee sent him to a decent town? Can't you just see that red-headed, uncouth boar preaching a sermon to an important congregation? Ha ha ha ha! They laugh him out of the pulpit. Ah, there's no chance of him getting a good appointment. You know, de Jong is dead set against him for his impudence in the classroom. Do you think he's sincere when he says that money means nothing to him? Oh, affectation, I suppose. Did you ever hear of anyone who didn't want to make a lot of money? You know, our Monsieur Van Gogh is no exception, I assure you. Still, Reverend Peterson likes him. Why, I don't know. But Peterson has influence. Who knows, he may even get her a better appointment than you and me. Uh uh, no fear of that. Peterson is not on the committee. Oh well, we'll know soon enough. I hope I get a position that pays at least 300 francs. Ha ha ha! You know Van Gogh would say, what is 300 francs? Let us give the money to the poor. Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ah, shh! Monsieur holier than thou approaches. Oh, good day to you, brother. Ah, this is a great day, Van Gogh. The climax to all our studies. How do you feel? Anxious. About where they'll send you? No. Anxious to go to work. Oh, of course. You know, all of us are. Aren't we, brother? Mmm, certainly. The world is waiting eagerly for us. Ha ha ha! I don't see anything to laugh about. Oh, you wouldn't, Van Gogh. Van Gogh? Van Gogh! Yes, Monsieur de Jong. The committee will see you now. I'm ready. He seems confident. Too confident. We shall be brief, Van Gogh. Yes, Monsieur. We have considered your case carefully, Van Gogh. You have shown a commendable sincerity and a certain diligence. However, after due deliberation, the committee has come to the regretful conclusion that you are not, as yet, fit to carry the word of God to the people. I don't understand. We have no appointment for you, Van Gogh. No appointment? But why? I worked hard. Very hard. The first rule of the church, Monsieur, is respect to authority. In Reverend de Jong's class, you showed yourself lacking in that necessary respect. Yes, deplorably so. I never fail in my respect to Reverend de Jong. You don't remember arguing with me on the methods of delivering a sermon? Yes, I did. But I meant no disrespect. I said then, and I would say it again now, that I cannot preach the word of God by rote. As a mechanical exercise, I can only preach from the heart, as I feel. I say things that are deep within me. I can't parrot the phrases of others. Oh, we've discussed this already. I don't wish to continue the argument. The committee has made its decision. We have no appointment for you. But, Monsieur, you need me. You need dozens of men to bring the word of God to villages all over Belgium. I'm very sorry, Van Gogh, but our decision is final. If you'd like to take the course of study over again, the committee might, at the end of another six months, reconsider its decision. Assuming, of course, that you showed a change of heart, and your conduct changed to a marked degree. I'm afraid that would be useless. I'd only disagree again. Then we've nothing further to say. I'm very sorry, Van Gogh, but I really don't think you're the necessary material for the church. You should take up some other calling, which might be more suitable for your obstreperous, independent spirit. Good day to you, Monsieur Van Gogh. Well, Van Gogh, what do you think of these drawings, eh? Why, they're not bad, Reverend Peterson. I didn't know you were an artist. Careful, careful, Vincent. Not so loud. But, this is a side of my life I carefully keep secret from my colleagues, De Young and Rysdale. Those gentlemen, as you yourself have discovered, do not approve of anything that does not conform to their own rigid notions of what is and what is not correct. Hmm. To them, even art is something wicked. Yes, I find it difficult to fit Monsieur De Young and Rysdale into my conception of a true clergyman. A man of God, it seems to me, should have a depth and breadth of understanding that embraces all of life. Mm-hmm. You, for instance, Reverend Peterson, are a man like that. Thank you, Vincent, for that pretty compliment. I mean that sincerely. I know it, Vincent. You could never say anything that did not come from your heart. Hmm. After my experience with the committee, that doesn't appear to be a very helpful characteristic. Oh, forget it, my boy. Every profession has its, well, its De Youngs and Rysdales. The church on earth, you know, unfortunately, is not served by angels, but by men. Yeah, so have I discovered. Yes, but I didn't call you here for a philosophical analysis of character. I want to help you. Have you considered what you'll do now? No. I was so stunned from my encounter with the committee, I... I haven't recovered sufficiently to think of what comes next. I haven't even written my brother Theo yet about all this. Would he be angry with you? No, not Theo. No. No man ever had a more understanding brother. But I... I hate to have him think... Vincent has done it again. Another failure. You're not a failure, Vincent. No, not an ordinary failure, but a very special one. This is my third failure. First London, the galleries, then the seminary, and now... The evangelists. At 24, you can't speak of failures. Only trial and error. Too many errors. What about another trial? What? And where? Do you still feel that you want to work... for God? Yes, I do. Deeply. Then I have a suggestion for you. Yes? Vincent, have you ever heard of the... Borinage? Borinage? No. The Borinage, according to the geography books, is one of the coal mining regions of Belgium. Anyone who's ever been there will tell you that this is an insufficient description. Frankly, Borinage is the nearest thing on earth to hell. Actual hell. Doesn't sound very inviting. Borinage, virtually everyone, men, women and children, make their living by going down into the coal mines. Even the children? Yes, Vincent, even the children. I've seen misery in slums and elsewhere, but I've never heard anything as bad as that. Their homes are the worst shacks. Their lives are awful beyond belief. That is the Borinage. Horrible. Vincent, these poor forgotten people of Borinage need someone like you to preach to them, to comfort them, to help them. Do you think I could? I'm certain you could, Vincent. You have such energy and such spirit, you could do a great deal of fine work there. Is there an appointment to be had there? No, but I've written to your father and explained the situation to him. He's agreed to send you a small sum every month. Enough to keep you there, until I can get the committee to appoint you formally to Borinage, so you'll be paid. A committee? The committee would never give me an appointment. If you do good work there, they dare not refuse to give you an appointment. I shall see to that. Well, what do you say, Vincent? I shall go to Borinage. Borinage. I shall go to Borinage. I shall go to Borinage. I shall go to Borinage. I shall go. I shall go but I'll go. Because I am leaving aibel Gateshead. I shall go. I shall go for it. I shall go. Let's go. I shall go with Borinage! Please, I shall go. And start theに منch with a Doggoat-American Woodland with the Lamp has delivered. The End I'm sorry, Monsieur Van Gogh, that I cannot offer you a better room. This is very simple. Oh, this will be fine, Madame Denis. It's clean, light, airy. This is splendid. I am deeply grateful to you for boarding me here, Madame Denis. Someday, perhaps, if I'm appointed, I'll be able to pay you regularly. Reverend Peterson is an old friend. I'm glad to help anyone he recommends. Mmm. That bread smells delicious. I can tell you're a good baker. It would be better if you reserved judgment until you have tasted it. But you will not have to wait long. Supper is ready now. Good. I know you want to get acquainted, so I've invited a friend, Monsieur Jacques, to eat with us. Oh, a miner? No, he's a foreman. I know you'll like him because he's still one of us. His sympathies are all with our people. Ah, Madame Denis. Bonsoir. Bonsoir, Monsieur Jacques. This is our new evangelist, Monsieur Van Gogh. How do you do? A great pleasure, Monsieur. It has been two years since we had an evangelist here in Petitouam. Too long. You will sit here, Monsieur Van Gogh, and you here, Jacques. Ah, this is the bread whose aroma fills your house. Yes, as good as I thought it would be. When a town has a baker as good as Madame Denis, it is fortunate, Monsieur. That is one of the few things Petitouam has to be thankful for. One of the few. You have a bad call, Monsieur Jacques. Ah, you will hear many such calls. After you've been in the boignage a while. I've coughed like this for many years. You understand, Monsieur Van Gogh? Tuberculosis? Yes. You should get away from here. Get some rest, sunshine, good air. Monsieur Van Gogh, you do not go away without money. Are there others here who are like you? I... Excuse me. You cannot work underground like a worm all your life. You may not get the sickness. Few escape. But then you see, Monsieur Van Gogh, I am more fortunate. I am a foreigner. I see the sun sometimes. Even if it is a smoky sun of boignage. And so perhaps if God is good, I'll have a few more years than the others. A few more. We must do something. Do? Do what? The company that owns those mines. They should take care of you. And the others who have the sickness. Yes. Yes. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. I can see you are new here, Monsieur Van Gogh. You will learn about the company, and what can be done, and what cannot be done. Monsieur, your soup is getting cold. There is time for talk later. Ah, yes, Madame is right. Come, Van Gogh. You will find the soup as good as her bread. Madame Perry. Madame Denis, I mean. Oh, hello, Pierre. Don't stand outside. Come in. This boy is the son of one of the miners, Ducro. How old? The boy? Yes. Nine. Nine. He looks like a little old man. He is old, Monsieur. We do not have children here, only men. The boys start to work in the mines at eight or nine, and they are old men in a few months. Madame Denis. Yes? Mother, she... A loaf of bread, my boy? Yes, but... You have no money. None. Here. Here are two loaves. Thank you. You see, Monsieur Van Gogh, a baker does not grow rich in Petit Rang. Well, boy, why do you stand there and stare? Your mother waits for the bread. Come, off with you. Well? Pierre, don't let your mother wait. What is the matter, boy? Have you been struck dumb? Answer me, what's the matter? Wait, I think I understand. Come here, child. It's all right, Pierre. Monsieur Van Gogh wants to speak to you. Pierre. That is your name, isn't it? Yes. Pierre, what is it you want? Don't be afraid, son. What is it? Nothing. How long has it been since you've eaten meat, Pierre? Last year. Once at Christmas time. We had some. And you're looking at that meat on the table here, aren't you? Good red meat. You want some of that, don't you? Don't you, Pierre? Yes. What have you eaten today? Last night. Some cheese. A potato. Today. Nothing. Madame Dany. Please, would you wrap up my portion of the meat here? Give it to the boy. He can bring it home with him. Perhaps some of that good soup in a jar. But you will be hungry, Monsieur Van Gogh. This is real hunger. Oh, yeah, my son. Bring me that pot on the shelf. Where are you going, Monsieur Van Gogh? I'm going to go to Pierre's house with him. Gauguin says you can get good peasant models down there, too. Peasants are the only possible people anyway. Yes, and the magnificent sun. Arles, where the fields are full of flowers, where nature is so beautiful, so intense, so colorful. Color everywhere. Color, color. Color. Theo, I want to get drunk with color. I'm going to Arles. Arles, Arles, Arles, Arles, Arles. Look at that sun, Gauguin. Lord, isn't that brilliant? You're the only one who thinks so, Van Gogh. To me, it's hot. Disagreeably hot. I can't even do my work. The heat dries up my color so fast. Vincent, don't pour your paints on like that. Be gentle. You're splashing it into my face. Oh, I love it. This seeps into my work. Look at those delicate clouds. Those shady trees. That detail of light in the field. Oh, this is sublime. Vincent, sometimes you behave like nothing but a country boy who believes art is a dream. It's nothing of the sort. Art is a conflict, a challenge, Vincent. You're not level-headed enough to confront that challenge maturely. Why do you always provoke me, Gauguin? Poke fun at me, my personality, my work. Work, work, that's all you know. You'd wear a Trojan horse down with your exalted rapture. And the pity is, none of your so-called work is saleable. But you certainly are one for getting the work out fast. No sooner do I arrive and all. Can you wait to let me catch my breath, unpack, rest for a moment? No. Paul. Paul, you must come out at once. Immediately, look around. You'll want to paint everything in sight. I want to show you this magnificent country, Paul. All is bursting with atmosphere. You'll make me laugh, Vincent. I can see you're out of sorts in this disagreeable sun. Ah, the trouble with you, Vincent, is you think painters are magicians. Just like that. Take your pallet and splash the sun of all smack across a canvas. That's exactly what I'm doing right now while you're trying to harangue me. You amaze me. I don't see how you can stay out here in this confounded sun without something to cover your head. You're going to get a case of sunstroke, sure thing. And where will you be? In an asylum, Gauguin. Stark mad. Don't disturb yourself about my head. Tell me, what do you think of the Elysians now that you're painting them yourself? Well, I can't say this painting of mine will be a tour de force, Vincent. No, I mean, what do you think of their color? Look what the sun's done to the tone of their flesh, their skin. Isn't it vibrant and tense? You certainly are a glutton for punishment, Vincent. Now you're getting yourself all excited over their skin. That's just like your scatterbrain. You ought to be tickled pink to get the heat of this glorious sun into your corrosive system, Gauguin. It'll excite your energies, put passion into your art. Boy, this is the most prodigious country you'll ever see. Feel the earth. Feel how hot it is. It's as if we're getting ready to erupt. I tell you, Earl's got tone, animation. It's the most moving country I've ever known. I love it here. I love every speck of it, I tell you. You're quite out of your mind, Vincent. I can see that. Now that light's the best thing in the world for you, Gauguin, and you know it. I'm not out of my mind. Light and sun, lots of it. It's good for any artist. This furious, fierce heat will burn the brains right out of your head yet. You'll see. Why don't you quit? Be sane, Vincent. I'm going to finish these sunflowers first, Gauguin. How do they look? Are they lifelike? Yes, but you pile your yellows on so thick you exaggerate. Too much vigor. You paint like a wild man. Painting is abstract. It has no room for slavishly copying nature nor for pointing out morals. If you want to preach, go back to Boronage. Painting is color, line, form. You use too much grease in your oars. You dig your brush too deep. Your mind is too photographic. And that yellow. It's violent. It's vulgar. But I want the color to be explosive, Gauguin. You'll never be an artist. Not until you can paint nature in cold blood. Painters like you, Gauguin, have your backs more and more to the wall. I don't want to paint in cold blood. I want to paint it hot blood. That's why I'm here in Arles. You're getting excited again. Ranting like a lunatic. I still say those colors are loud, gaudy, pretentious. They're a fake imitation, and you're drunk with color. Time will tone them down. Look at those two crazy people fighting, Ormond. They must be painters. Look at that big one with all the red hair. Which one, Francis? There. See? The ugly one with the big red face and lots of red hair. He's so funny looking. Who is he? You know him. Sure I know him. Everybody here does. What a funny looking man. He's that red-headed man from Holland. Oh. The one with the cafe downstairs? Uh-huh. My mother says he's a crazy man. That one over there. He certainly is crazy. My, how red his eyes are now, Francis. Look at what he's doing. Throwing all that paint over the wall. No. He must be having a fit. Better be careful, Francis. They both look crazy to me. Let's yell back at them. Foo-roo! Foo-roo! Foo-roo! Hey! Shoo, you ruffins! Now get out of here! Go on, go home! Get out! Go on, go away from here! Foo-roo! Foo-roo! Foo-roo! Foo-roo! Well, Paul, I guess that's all I really am. Now you see what this town really thinks of me. Even those little children know I'm mad. Red-headed crazy man they call me. Foo-roo! Foo-roo! That's what they all call me, till I can't stand it any longer! Now, what in the name of blazes did you go and do that for? First you fling the paint all over the meadows, and now you rip these canvases like a madman. Oh, Vincent, what's come over you anyway? Have you actually gone out of your mind as the sun finally got you? What difference does it make to you, Gauguin? What do you care about that canvas? You said it was no good anyway. Did sentiment get the better of you? No, but you ripped mine too, you lunatic. Can't you restrain your indignation? I don't know what to do, Paul. Paul, I am losing my mind. No money to live, to eat. No respect. Only aggravation and poverty. That maddening sun is enough to get anybody crazy. I'm sorry, Paul, I'm sorry. I guess it's this work and all this scorching heat. Let's stop this infernal bickering. I know, I know. You're a much greater painter than I am, Paul. You can teach me plenty, I don't know. I believe that. But you mustn't mock me, Paul. Please. You understand that. I get upset so easily because it's so hard, Paul. Believe me, I respect your help. I need it. Please forgive me, Paul. Well, let's forget it. Come on, Brigadier. Let's go over to the cafe and get a drink. Yes, that's what you need more than anything else. A drink. Come on. We'll drink some absinthe to our mutual talents. This one's our favorite. Will you have another drink, Vincent? No, Gogan. What do you pay for your room here? Fifteen francs. Theo sends it to me every month. Only fifteen francs? Why, it's unbelievable, Vincent. At that rate, there'll be a whole colony of artists and all. Which would be a very good thing, Gogan. I can't explain it. But you know, with you here, I feel as though I'm really beginning to paint. Yes. But I still think you have a passion for yellows. It's bad. Better get rid of it, Vincent. You know, there are painters whose work becomes all dried up because they don't use their heads. Gogan. Be a good chap, will you please? Hey. Who's that dancer, Gogan? Isn't she beautiful? I don't know, Vincent. She's all right. All right? Casson. Meet your ship, Angle. Casson. Call the dancers to our table. Bien, monsieur. Hello. I'm Nanette. Nanette? You're a pretty girl, Nanette. Oh, monsieur, monsieur. Merci for the compliment. I like the men to like me. It makes things nicer, don't you think? Sometimes, yes. You're very lovely, Nanette. And you dance divinely. Oh, monsieur. What's your name? Vincent. Vincent. That's a nice name. You think so? Nobody else does. Oh, what funny little ears you have, Vincent. Just like a puppy. Will you come to see me, Nanette? Tonight? Please. Well, not tonight, Vincent. I can't. If you'd love me, you could. I love your ears, Vincent. Will you give me one to play with? I'd love to have it. I've got to go now. Remember, don't forget to send me your ears. You like her, don't you, Vincent? That must be the heat. It's got you sure enough. I told you to wear a hat. Picking on a commoner like that. You're mad, Vincent. You're mad, Gauguin. Keep your voice down. Where do you think you are? Everybody's mad in this town. Yes, yes, Brigadier, but please don't shout. That's why they call me Furu and shout the red-handed crazy man. I've never seen your eyes graze like this before. They're two balls of fire. You. The head is as raw as me. You're trying to get rid of me. You want to kill me. Yes, that's why you brought me here. You want to kill me. Good going mad, man. You're stark crazy. Don't, Vincent. Don't throw that glass out. I'm mad. That's all you ever tell me. You're out to kill me, but you can't. Because before you kill me, I'll kill you first. Put down the glass, you fool. You're crazy. I'll kill you first. Go again. Please. Stop packing, Go again. Where are you going? You needn't ask me that. After that shameful scene downstairs, I'd be crazy to stay a minute longer. Go again, please. You must stay. It's no use, Vincent. My mind's made up utterly and unchangeably. I can't live with you and all after that idiotic outburst. You're suffering delusions, and I can't see a sane reason in the world why I should put up with your fits. I promise to behave. I swear I will. I'll stop fighting with you. I swear. I give you my word. Please stay and be my friend. I need you. If you go now, whatever I've learned from you will be lost. My work will suffer. Please, Go again. I apologize for my actions tonight. I apologize. I've made my decision. It's useless to coax me. I've given you many chances already. Go again, please. You've taught me more than I ever knew before. If you leave me now, it'll be my end. I warn you. I'll give all your love to Theo when I arrive in Paris, Vincent. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye. I've opened it up. Goodbye. Goodbye. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. exit. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Close. Nanette! Oh, you fool rude! What do you want now? I brought you a souvenir. How nice. What is it? Open it. You'll see. Not here. Come upstairs with me and I'll unwrap it. No, open it here. I don't want to go up there. Vincent, your ear. You cut off your ear. No, no, no, no, Vincent. After this thorough examination, I'm convinced you suffer from no organic disease. Your troubles are nothing but the foibles of an artist for which there is no medicine. And the police and townspeople of Arles had no right trying to arrest you. I've always said, doctor, everyone's more or less crazy. More vital a painter's art, greater is madness. Ah, genius and lunacy, Vincent, are well known to be the next door neighbors. But madness, madness in great ones must not unwatched go. Ah-ha, Shakespeare. Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha. Why, Vincent, you know Daumier, when he was here? You know, he was so mad, I thought he ought to be taken around by a circus on show. Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha. Come, come, let's go to dinner. Dinner? You know, I'm afraid you're trying to poison me, Dr. Gachet. Poison you? Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha. Ah, nonsense, Vincent, my good man. Don't you like our food? Yes, I do. That's the trouble. I do too much. Then what's wrong? Oh, nothing. Except why, instead of serving fancy hors d'oeuvres and expensive wines, don't you spend your money on picture frames? Ha-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha. Picture frames, Vincent? Yes, Dr. Gachet, picture frames. Why, Vincent, your pictures, unframed as they are, will live long after they're both gone. Why am I worried about this? Because it makes me mad to see them so. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, Vincent. Then I will get some frames and hang them up for you. Why don't you do it now? Oh. This painting, Vincent. It's like the song of a hero. What are you talking about? Ah, Vincent. If only I had painted one canvas like this. You know, Vincent, I cure people's heads, but in the end they die. But this Arlesienne, these sunflowers of yours, they will cure the pain in people's hearts. Oh, Vincent, you should be a happy man. Exaggerate, doctor. I've only begun to paint. Vincent, the brushwork of your canvases for me become rich melodies. Fantastic. Yep. It's very nice. It's very nice. It's very nice. Thank you. Thanks, Lisa.
