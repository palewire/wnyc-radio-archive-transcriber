For cross and country, we associate ourselves together. These words, the first lines of the preamble to the Constitution of the American Legion, most appropriately serve to open this program, presented under the auspices of the American Legion and dedicated to the furtherance of its nationwide Back to God program, which calls for a spiritual reawakening in our time. The voices you hear are those of the West Point Military Chapel Choir. Presiding in these special services here in New York's Center Theater today is American Legion National Chaplain, Johnny Duffy. May our hearts be united in the singing of our national anthem. Oh, say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave And of the free, and the home of the brave. And now may I ask American Legion past national chaplain, Rabbi David Leftowicz, Jr. of Louisiana, to deliver the invocation. Today, as we recall the sinking of the troop ship Dorchester, let us commemorate the courage of the four chaplains. John P. Washington, a Roman Catholic priest. Alexander D. Good, a rabbi. George L. Fox and Clark B. Poling, Protestant ministers, who united in prayer, gave their life belts and their lives on that day ten years ago in order that others might live. Let us, O God, inspired by the memory of their faith and sacrifice, discover the true meaning of a return to religious belief and practice. May our program Back to God, offered in a spirit of reverence, be blessed with holy strength and purpose, and promote a spiritual reawakening in the hearts of our people, serving to symbolize for all nations and creeds the individual responsibility of free men, one to the other. In God. Amen. At the opening of our program, you heard the West Point Choir singing the opening phrases of the American Legion Preamble. We are pleased to present this stirring composition in its entirety. It will be sung by Morton Downey. For God and country, we associate ourselves together for the following purposes.

Eisenhower Our Legionnaire Vice President Richard M. Nixon The New Cabinet And The Administration O Almighty And Eternal God Who Has Revealed Thy Glory To All Nations Be With Us And Lead Our President May We Unite In Silent Prayer Asking That You Assist Him And His Administration With Your Spirit Of Consul And Fortitude That He May Be Eminently Useful To His People And To Mankind Perpetuating The Blessings Of Equal Liberty And Now Recorded At The White House In Washington D.C. Ladies And Gentlemen The President Of The United States My Grateful Thanks Go Out To Each Of You For Your Prayers Because Your Prayers For Divine Guidance On My Behalf Are The Greatest Gift You Could Possibly Bring To Me As Your Prayers Came From Your Heart So There Comes From Mine A Very Earnest One That All Of Us By Our Combined Dedication And Devotion May Merit The Great Blessings That The Almighty Has Brought To This Land Of O We Think Often Of These Blessings In Terms Of Material Value Our Broad Acres Our Great Factors All Of Those Things Which Make Our Life A More Convenient And Finer Thing In The Material Sense But When We Think About The Matter Very Deeply We Know That The Blessings That We Are Really Thankful For Of A Different Type They Are What Our Forefathers Call Our Right Our Human Right The Right To Worship As We Please To Speak And To Think And To Earn And To Save Those Are The Rights That We Must Strive So Mightily To Merit One One Reason That We Cherish These Rights So Sincerely Is Because They Are God Given They Belong To People Who Have Been Created In His In T Matt Is His And WWE So Many of our fellow citizens have died. Today we are specially inspired in our resolution to defend those rights by the memory of four chaplains who met death bravely, quietly, even tranquilly in the thinking of the Dorchester. They gave their lives without complaints so that their fellow citizens could live. As we think of their sacrifice and that of our heroic fellow citizens serving in Korea, we are inspired to take up our own burdens more cheerfully. We are moved to show by greater courage, by patience and mutual understanding, by better citizenship, that we are worthy members of this great American family of free, God-fearing people. Thomas E. Paradine, chairman of the American Legion National Security Commission. Mr. Paradine. We know through one of the oldest of history books, the Bible, that there is a very real and quite understandable creator. And yet in a recent poll, it was revealed that about 750,000 Americans doubt the existence of God. More popular than that is the passive attitude of other millions of Americans who acknowledge God's existence, but whose spiritual awareness has become dulled with apathy. It is the growth of such materialistic concept that the American Legion deplores. And in order to help arrest this drift away from God, the American Legion has inaugurated a program that offends no faith but benefits all, called the Back to God Movement. This program urges regular public worship, daily family prayer, and religious instruction of youth. The American American Legion invites you to join with us in this crusade. And now from the Center Theater here in New York, may I ask Chaplain John B. Williams of Pennsylvania to pronounce the benediction. May God our Father grant his blessings upon our president and his administration, leading our people to an enlightened peace and to increasing creative productivity. Help us today as we commemorate the unforgettable sacrifice of these four chaplains who gave their lives in the sinking of the troop ship Dorchester, captured an essence of faith, tolerance, and goodwill, toward our fellow man. And as our spiritual strength is renewed this day, may we go forth to accomplish the will of our God and Creator. We know, dear God, that through the islands of history, people in many times and many places have faced problems which seemed insurmountable, and as they have been troubled and confused, they have turned to thee for comfort and for guidance. Man in this 20th century, man in this 20th century, man in this 20th century inherits a fabulous civilization. And even now from day to day, we are amazed at the incredible advances of human knowledge and by the products of human invention. Man in this 20th century, man in this 20th century, we are amazed at the incredible advances in the world. And as we realize the power of our own minds and are reminded anew of our need for thy surveillance, we do call upon thee. Oh God, our hope in ages past, let thy people be not fearful. As we reaffirm our faith in thee, as we reaffirm our faith in thee, renewed our spirit, that we may look to the problems of our one day with confidence and with courage, born of thy divine will and enlightenment. We are thy people in the work of thy creation. Be with us in our way as we follow our duties and ourselves and our fellows and to our heavenly Father. Help us as we make these decisions and perform these acts, which even now are forming the new pages of man's history upon the earth. Amen.
