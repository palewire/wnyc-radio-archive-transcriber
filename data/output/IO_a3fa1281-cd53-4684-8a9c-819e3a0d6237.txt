The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay In the end of theI I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am near At the front To fight the foe Give us soldier boys on marching And I can no longer stay Come I hear the beautiful calling Goodbye darling pray Come on down south Way way down south Where the sun shines every day Soft skies of blue shine down anew And all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay Come on, come on along Come on join in the song Jump on for this, it won't be long We're on our way Hip hip hooray We're going down south Hooray With your great all days From the suün Although the sun! Hooray The love you i used to love With your thousands of stars And76 And since makes the heart grow thunder, ooh. And since makes the heart grow thunder, that is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I've hunked, wondering, darling, is your true? Distance only lands and shuns, though the ocean waves divine. Absence makes the heart grow thunder, longing to be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother just because there is no other. She'll be happy till her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, yes, we do, Christ we do. When the harvest days are over, yes, we do. When the harvest days are over, yes, we do. Me, look back so merely in me, people when you sing. Please pää so dear, you will be sad you need to speak. When the hottest days are over Jesse dear, my Jesse dear Jesse would come with a strawberry crown When the band played on He'd like to come to the floor with a trail he adored As the band played on But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded The poor girl would shake me along He's there, he's a girl with a strawberry crown As they are Sweet Adeline My Adeline At night, dear heart For you I find In all my dreams In all my dreams Your fair-faced be Your fair-faced be Your fair-faced be You're the flower of my heart Sweet Adeline Al Jum kart We saw Let's go If parale Our own Oh, you're a man in a fearless day, a beautiful sight to hear. You may think he's happy and free from care, he's not a voice he seems to be. He is done when you think of a weightless life, for you cannot make me wait. And her beauty was sold for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a gilded hay. A little brown car, a shady green spot. So happy home I find. My heart's barely gone, I love only one. She's the girl I have to be mine. Just one girl, only just one girl. Where on earth I know what's there not my heart. The Lord ain't just a day. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. Wonder. I'll be happy forever, Christian. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. pneumonia asshole.
