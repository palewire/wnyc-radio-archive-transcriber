The Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable Vincent Impeletere, is host today to Mr. A. Philip Randolph, President of the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Mr. Whelan has just conducted the guest into the Board of Estimate room here at City Hall, and Mr. Whelan has just called for the National Anthem. The Access House The Access House The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The Brotherhood has grown to a membership of 18,000 individuals of 11 different races. The End Social gains have been equally outstanding. The Brotherhood and Mr. Randolph led the movement in 1941, which brought about the establishment by President Roosevelt of the Fair Employment Practice Committee. This committee opened thousands of new industrial jobs to Negroes, a blessing not only to their race, but to our entire war effort. Again, the Brotherhood can be credited with the progress that has been made in eliminating discrimination in the armed forces of the United States. The struggle of this great labor organization has been the American struggle for equality under law, for equal rights to employment, for freedom of the individual, for the entire democratic process which strengthens our nation and protects us all. I wish Mr. Randolph and his fellow workers in the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters continued success in their efforts. I join the entire community in admiration for their courage. I pledge them my continued support and friendship. I want them to know that the people of the City of New York welcome them and are proud of the great organization that had its start here in this great city of opportunity. Ladies and gentlemen, President A. Philip Randolph. Mr. Whalen, Honorable Vincent Impelitari, Acting Mayor of the City of New York, Honorable Vincent Impelitari, Acting Mayor of the City of New York, and its 25th Anniversary in the Freest and the Greatest City in the World. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well, while the Department of Sanitation Band was playing, Maestro John Celebrate conducting, the Honorable Vincent Impeletere took the occasion to pose for pictures with Mr. A. Philip Randolph and his guests and all the distinguished guests who have come here today to City Hall commemorating two occasions, the meeting within our city of the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and observing the 25th anniversary of the organization as well, which started with six men and now has a membership of 18,000. Mr. A. Philip Randolph is a graduate of the College of the City of New York and it is particularly interesting that so much of this has happened right in our own city. Now the Mayor and the Honorable Vincent Impeletere, Mr. Randolph, and the guests today are leaving the Board of Estimate room in City Hall. The Mayor had planned a very beautiful reception outside City Hall for his guests today, but the weatherman was a rather mean person today. And as we said in an announcement here in the chamber, we hope that if the weatherman ever gets on a Pullman train, the Pullman porters will know what to do with him. Thanks, Miss Mac, Mayor other staff of baseball over.
