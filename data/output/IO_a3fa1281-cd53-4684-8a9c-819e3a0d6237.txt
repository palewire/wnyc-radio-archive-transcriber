The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the bugle I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, may Goodbye, darling, I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tell me I am near the end Tells theramento the end let's say The air at the front to fight the contagy And I can no longer stay. Ah, I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, follow this, it won't be long. We're on our way, hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, hoo, way. And since makes the heart grow thunder, That is why I long for you. And since makes the heart grow thunder, That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I've hung up, Wondering, darling, if you're true. Distance only lands and shuns, Though the ocean waves divide, Absence makes the heart grow thunder, Longing to be near you. Be near your heart. Be near your heart. She was happy till she met you, And the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, You will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother, Just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, Yes, she's here, Christ, she's here, And the sun gets flowers, No, she's died so free, She's died so free. You will keep the word you said, That's the time we too shall wear, When the harvest days are over, Just be near, My just be near. The day we would come with a strong head and dog, And the band stayed on. He's like from the floor, With a trail he adored, As the band stayed on. But his brain was so loaded, It nearly exploded, The poor girl would shake me along. He's there is a trail with a tall landing ground, And the band stayed on. Sweet Adeline, Sweet Adeline, Sweet Adeline, My Adeline, My Adeline, My Adeline, At night, dear heart, At night, dear heart, For you I find, For you I find, In all my dreams, In all my dreams, In all my dreams, Your fair face being, In all my dreams, Your fair face being, Your fair face being, You're the flower of my heart, Sweet Adeline, Sweet Adeline, Sweet Adeline, The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Don't hear them there, say the ringing of the glory of the day.
