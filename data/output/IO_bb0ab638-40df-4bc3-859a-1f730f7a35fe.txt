The city station and the microphones of networks and all other facilities are in the council chamber. It's very interesting broadcast. Regrettable indeed that we can bring you the picture as well. When the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, receives His Excellency Miguel Alamón, President of Mexico. There's been a great deal of advance information on the visit of the President of Mexico to our country since we all know the particulars and the magnificent pageantry. That was a factor in the federal welcome to the President of Mexico when the President of the United States, President Truman, welcomed our distinguished neighbor from the South in Washington, D.C. Well, the only meaning in the crowd today is the weatherman. He hasn't sent us the best day possible, but as Al Jolson would say, it's raining violets, so if you want to accept that discount, why, it's all right. A great number of people have turned out in a national Mexican costume, and it lends indeed a remarkably interesting color to the pageant today, a little touch of folklore that we don't often get, because on most of these occasions, everyone is all dressed up in their best bib and tucker, a la Hottie Carnegie, and Earl Benham and so forth, and we don't see much of the national aspect. Yet the Mexicans have turned out in their colorful national costumes, hundreds of them in front of City Hall, and the military display from Fort Jay is indeed a very impressive one. On a balcony outside City Hall, especially arranged in the park, within good focusing distance of all that is to take place here today, your movie cameras are busy grinding and making a record of today's event. One of the splendid things about movies and cameras is the fact that we can always recapture the event, who is there, what they look like, and all about it, in future times when we're trying to get a better idea of history, why there's the picture, and the words naturally are easy to put together. A picture can kill a million words, and sometimes it does. We're just waiting expectantly now, because those who arrived in the vehicles with the President of Mexico, Mr. Whelan and the Mayor, why they're doing their best to get into the small colonial confines of this truly beautiful building, City Hall. We can't help thinking what an extremely fortunate circumstance it is that our thoughtful forefathers put together in the exact proportions of beauty that the City Hall does obtain, so that it really makes an interesting background from any angle that you would like to take a picture. The magnificent hallway, that staircase which is so impressively beautiful, the crystal chandeliers, the governor's room, the furniture from old Federal Hall, when the government of the United States was established first under President Washington at Nassau on Wall Street. All these things are recapitulated right here and brought forcibly to our mind. The very idea of the building itself gives us some idea of what the forefathers thought was an adequate building for a city like New York at the time. Well, one of the standing jokes is the fact that they never put the white marble on the back of City Hall because they said it would be centuries before the city went that far. Canal Street was the scene of the Lisbonard Farm, and the only reminder we have of that now is the fact that Lisbonard Street is just a block below Canal Street, and we get some idea then of the early beginnings of the colonial picture at the time. And yet we imagine, from the standpoint of colonial times, this building was huge indeed. If anyone doubts the sincerity and the pride and the joy of the Mexican people that are fortunate enough to be here in New York City, they should see the unqualified wreaths of smiles, their faces, their flowers, their color. Everything is happiness supreme. They feel indeed very happy about the visit of the president of their land here in New York City, and one of the factors of City Hall is the fact that at this focal point, all these historical factors culminate in the reception which the mayor of the city of New York presents and extends to those who have accomplished. And no city in the world loves to recognize accomplishments so thoroughly and completely as New York City that has accomplished so much. The only delay now is the fact that you just can't move in the aisle of the council chamber just at present, since those who arrived in the cars are jamming the aisles, but the police department is doing their usual smiling, pleasant, shall I say, job on an occasion like this. Would it be prodigal? But they're arranging it very nicely, and the people are finding space where there didn't seem to be any. And even people are moving over, and where one person sat, well, in some occasions, two people are managing to sit. Depends on the destiny that shapes our ends. We're just waiting expectantly now. President Aleman, the mayor, Mr. Whelan, and the distinguished group of citizens who are on the committee welcoming the president of Mexico have adjourned to the governor's room at the head of the staircase here in City Hall so that some sort of order can come out of the late arrival of guests. The police officers are now distributing those who cannot find a seating room around the walls, the beautiful paneled walls of this council chamber with its magnificent painted ceilings with the escutcheons of the five boroughs and the civic goddess enthroned in the middle panel and, again, surrounded by the escutcheons and coats of arms of the boroughs. And now, ladies and gentlemen, here is the mayor of the city of New York. Mayor of the city of New York, escorting His Excellency, Miguel Aleman, president of Mexico. Some of the little Mexican children there in the aisle in their Mexican costumes stepped out of line, police or no police, and they gave their beloved president a very warm shake hand. He stopped a moment. So did the mayor. And now, through this tremendous concourse, the mayor is finally able to make the rostrum, and the president and the mayor are on the rostrum now in the council chamber. The Mexican and American flags are waving. The cameramen are shooting. Let's hope the day will come when the only shot in the world will be a camera shot from one of the men holding a camera. These familiar faces, particularly to anyone who has handled these occasions at City Hall, it's interesting to see the familiar faces of the cameramen that have participated for years in these things. That's why we receive such expert coverage at all times of any event that takes place. And if the president of Mexico thinks he has ever faced a barrage of any kind, he's never quite equal to the one that's flashing lightning now in front of the, ordinarily, the council president's chair here in the council chamber. It's a very fine arrangement of rostrum and chair so that the distinguished guests have every possible vantage point. And yet, the room itself performs wonders regardless of its size. It's interesting to watch Mr. Morris' portrait of Lafayette, who invented, Mr. Morris invented the telegraph, you know, and so few people know he was a fine artist. And now Mr. Whelan is speaking and presenting his guest. Mr. Whelan has just spoken. He has announced the singer. The two anthems will be sung, the American and the Mexican anthem. Mexicanos al grito de guerra, el acero apresada, el bridón, y retiembla en su centro la tierra, al sonoro rugir del cañón. Y retiembla en su centro la tierra al sonoro rugir del cañón. Niño, patria, tus sienes de oliva, de la paz del arcángel divino, en el cielo tu eterno destino por el dedo de Dios escribió. Mas Dios haría un extraño enemigo, profanar con sus plantas su suelo. Piensa, patria querida del cielo, un soldado en cada hijo de Dios. Si un soldado cada hijo de Dios, mexicanos al grito de guerra, el acero apresa del brinón. Y retiembla en su centro la tierra al sonoro rugir del cañón. Y retiembla en su centro la tierra al sonoro rugir del cañón. Just heard Mr. Thora's sing the Mexican anthem, and now Miss Manning of the Chicago Opera Company is announced by Mr. Whalen to sing the American anthem. Sing the national anthem. Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, who's brought stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight. For the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming. And through, through, through the night, the haplight was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, for the land of the brave, and the hope of the brave. Maestro Celebre and the Department of Sanitation Band, that excellent organization of musicians who have played so often on these occasions, accompanied the two singers. And now, Mr. Whalen. Mr. Mayor, it is a great privilege to present to you, His Excellency Miguel Alamón, President of the Republic of Mexico. Well, again, the shooting, I mean the cameras, of course. And it's an excellent opportunity to combine a picture of the president and the mayor. President Alamón. Your Excellency, Today, the great city of New York is extremely proud and happy to pay tribute to a most distinguished visitor, President Miguel Alamón of the Republic of Mexico. In the Council Chamber, in this historic city hall, we have assembled for this official reception to the chief executive of our southern friend and neighbor. Here, many celebrated international figures have been accorded the heartwarming greetings of this metropolis of the world. none was ever more welcome than His Excellency President Ali Mann. Thank you. President Ali Mann symbolizes the bond of friendship that exists between the republics of Mexico and the United States. He and his fellow citizens recently demonstrated in eloquent fashion their affection for the United States when they graciously entertained President Truman with characteristic Mexican hospitality. But the friendship of Mexico and Mexicans for this nation and the American people has been demonstrated on many other occasions. we remember particularly that during the recent war the Republic of Mexico joined with this nation in the world battle for freedom and that her troops served with ours in the liberation of the Philippines. We must never allow comradeship of the battlefield to become a victim of peacetime indifference or misunderstanding. I am confident the mutual affection of our two great peoples will grow even stronger with time and that Mexico under such enlightened leadership will gain even greater stature among the nations of the world as a bulwark of progressive democracy. This visit of your excellency provides us with a long desired opportunity to show our genuine affection for you and the people of Mexico. As mayor of the city of New York and on behalf of the citizens of our city I bid you sir a cordial welcome. Furthermore I do hereby cite for distinguished and exceptional public service S of the close to the nation who has contributed immeasurably to the understanding between the Republic of Mexico and the United States to emphasize the esteem and affection in which the great President of Mexico and her citizens are held by the people of our city, I have the honor to confer honorary citizenship of the City of New York upon our distinguished visitor. The mayor of the City of New York has just presented the scroll to President Alamon of Mexico, and you're not seeing it over the radio, but your cameramen are in there shooting away, and you'll get pictures in all the papers tomorrow. The movies will record it. In fact, every facility for recording this event by pictures is being thoroughly undertaken by the cameramen. And I've seen barrages of cameramen before, but not quite as many as are here. And I notice there are a great many apparently from Mexico and Spanish-speaking organizations as well. And now we'll... Oh, well, prodigal vanishes when the cameramen get busy because they just take pictures, whether the anthem's playing or anything else, and we understand why. Because a picture is a picture when it happens, not possibly when the opportunity comes to take it. And when they see something that looks like a picture, they take that picture, and the temporary suspense of prodigal is pardonable in this particular case. And years later, when we go to the files, I should be technical and say the morgue, but I hate the word, of the newspaper offices, and pull out these pictures, then indeed the graphic story is told. Mayor O'Dwyer. It is now my honor and privilege to present to you His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Mexico. President Alemán is certainly receiving a most cordial welcome here in City Hall today. You've just heard Mayor O'Dwyer present him. He's begging them to keep quiet so that he may speak. And now the President of Mexico. Mr. Alcald, with particular agrado, I welcome the words of welcome that in the name of the city of New York has just pronounced. Inspired by the noble sentiment of the interamerican solidity, God almighty has put together and of the greater groans if youสgrad сегодня will be Jeśli meterte and deep duck and frank appreciation to my country In惜 if you are past to understand the importance of improving how it is standing per 싶은 when their population lives and that, in order to achieve such a purpose, has implemented with enthusiasm a campaign of economic recovery. New York offers the estimulatory example of a city and its work, in which activity is the human effort, sustained without death. Here is labor human. The nature brinds only a piece of land between two anchors of the flu, close to the ocean. The industry did the same. The tunnel through the rock, inarco the puentes, over both rivers, and alzó the torres that mud the city in a splendid ciment of acero. Cimented in the rock of Manhattan, New York, the energy of its moradores no less firm than that. Emporium that flows the naves of all the seas and the airs of all the ciels. The great urbe has made, in a little more than a century, its prodigy expansion. They are wonderful to observe its continuance and its juveniles' dynamism. But even more, the power of the material which is incontrastable could anulatory all the activity of the thought in New York, the interest for the intellectuals and the most important of the world. The museum offers the art and multiple riquezas of the saber. The bibliothèques reflect the rhythm of the population and the best of the youth neoyorquina study in the university not only the techniques professional that will have to be more later if not what the universe proposes to the the apetent investigatory of the spirit. But if the surprise has turned the world from a century to this part to this city in the end of the city now the way is also to this the hope. The the the the two Schuld of the peopleool И that eleva your torch in your Bahia. A work started by the United Nations, Mexico brings its disinterested concurso and as a first step to the execution of those fines, sustenta the doctrine of the continental solidarity by the engagement of the links between the republics of our hemisphere and the which une, more than the geographical situation and the analogy of the past, the semenza of institutions and the love of freedom. Tales nexos revisten evident importance in the relations between countries that, like Mexico and the United States, are limítrofes. So they profess both governments and they have understood the two peoples, cordial is our amistad. According to the approval of the excellent President Truman to Mexico and my presence here, to correspond to it. In the amable welcome that New York has given me, I have found a augurio propitious to the development of the policy of J.F. and to the Adventure хочется to the exchange for every one wraps, bizz fun and justice and the efforts of the United States of the United States in favor of those ideals. For them, Mexico has fought the same way in the long of its agitated history and in the hard years of the recent war. And for them, they were put their blood on the Mexican soldiers side to side with the children of this country in the common defense of the human rights. It is the spirit of a firm adhesion to democracy and the faith in the freedom the that moves me to ask, Mr. Alcald, that you serve as a accept, with my recognition for the distinction I receive and with my votes for your personal adventure and your collaborators, those who I sincerely form for the progress and prosperity of the city of New York. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For the benefit of those who may have tuned in late, you're listening in on the reception by the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, to His Excellency Miguel Aleman, President of Mexico, who just concluded his speech. There will be a translation. The official interpreter, President Hubertus Sein. In honor, I shall cherish with enduring pleasure the words of welcome which on behalf of the city of New York you have spoken. Inspired by the noble sentiment of inter-American solidarity, they are a message of friendship for my country, for they will stir an echo of profound appreciation. Mexico, now engaged in the great task of improving the living conditions of its people, and having for this purpose undertaken an intensive campaign of economic recovery and development, finds in New York City the stimulating example of a tireless, dynamic activity. Everything here is the product of human labor and ingenuity. Nature contributed only a strip of land between two wide streams near the ocean. Industry has accomplished the rest. It has drilled a network of tunnels in the rock. It has arched mighty bridges over the rivers. It has raised the stately towers that make your city a veritable beehive of steel. Erected on rock, your city has been built likewise on the granite-like energy of its people, an emporium whither flocked the ships that ply all the oceans, and now the airships of all the skies. This great metropolis has attained its prodigious expansion in little more than a century. Visitors marvel at its unbroken growth and its youthful enthusiasm, but they admire even more the fact that its material prowess has not overwhelmed its spiritual achievements. New York City is vitally interested in cultural pursuits of all kinds. Its museums serve culture, displaying the richest treasures of art, as well as the most illuminating exhibits of science. Its libraries reflect the intellectual growth of its people, and its magnificent colleges and universities enlighten its youth eager to acquire not only technical or specialized knowledge, but also to engage in research and satisfy the quenchless curiosity which nature awakens in the minds of men. During the last hundred years, the world has turned its fascinated, admiring eyes towards this ever-expanding city. Now it turns them in tremulous hope. Your city has been chosen as the seat of the United Nations. The stricken, distressed peoples of the world are placing their faith in this organization, which conducts here the widest experiment yet attempted by man to abolish war and to maintain peace on a basis of understanding and amity. The colossal statue holding aloft its torch in New York Bay has become anew the symbol of liberty. Mexico's contribution to the work of the United Nations has been heartfelt and generous. But Mexico believes that the first step we must take in the furtherance of the ends pursued by that organization is to uphold hemispheric solidarity, strengthening the ties that bind the American republics together. Let us remember that our countries are united by the similarity of their institutions and their common love of freedom, rather than by their geographical proximity and parallel histories. such bonds are doubly important in the relations between countries such as Mexico and the United States that have a common border. both our governments realize this importance. Both our peoples understand it. That our friendship is cordial and sincere was amply shown by the visit of His Excellency Harry S. Truman, President of the United States, to Mexico, and by my presence here to return his courteous call. In the hearty and gracious welcome with which I have been greeted in New York City, I find an auspicious omen for the advancement of the good neighbor policy and for an ever-growing exchange of goods and services between our nations, commercial, cultural, and touristic. Today, on this spot, which symbolizes the ideals of political freedom, I cannot but think of all the efforts made by the people of the United States on behalf of those ideals. Mexico has also striven for them all along its troubled history, and recently during the hard years of the war. For those ideals, Mexican soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder with your own troops shed their blood in our common defense of the rights of man. It is this spirit of earnest devotion to democracy and of faith in freedom that moves me to ask, Mr. Mayor, that you kindly accept together with my gratitude for the honor you have done me, my fervent wishes for your personal happiness and that of your worthy assistance, as well as for the prosperity and progress of the City of New York. You heard the ambassador who made the translation of President Aleman's speech when the President of Mexico responded to Mayor O'Dwyer's generous and resplendent greeting for the city. Mr. Whelan. If our distinguished mayor has any weakness, it is towards his alma mater. And one of the musts that he insists upon before your Excellency leaves this century-old building is a song from the Police Glee Club.ний The End The End The End The End The End That was the Police Glee Club, sang at special request to the Mayor, honoring the President of Mexico here in City Hall. It's a splendid thing that we have the musical organizations of the City Department, so now Mr. Whalen. I'll be seated while His Honor the Mayor escorts His Excellency from the room. And now the Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, the Honorable Grover Ray Whalen, the distinguished members of the Mayor's Committee, act as an escort to the President of Mexico, the Honorable Miguel Aleman, as he turns again toward the Great Hall and City Hall here, and is leaving for the cars that will take him to the Hotel Commodore. And at that point, the Mayor of the City of New York and the Mayor's Committee are tendering a lunch to His Excellency, President Aleman, and the members of his entourage, and your city will broadcast the various microphones of your city radio stations will carry the speeches from the room in the Hotel Commodore. There was just a little stop there, and I wanted to see what was going to happen. No, they're safely out now of the Council Chamber here in City Hall. And that's about all we have to tell you from City Hall, and we return you now to the studios.
