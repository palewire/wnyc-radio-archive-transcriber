These are tales of two cities. Yes, these are tales of two cities. Cities separated by miles upon miles of restless ocean, yet bound irrevocably together by the hopes, the dreams, the simple acts of heroism of their millions of little people. Latitude 5130 North. Longitude 12 minutes West. Come on, lads. We time for another wicket. Jackie, you'd better come on home now. Oh, come off it, sis. You know it's not yet tea time. All right, laddie. Boom. Latitude 42 North. Longitude 74 West. Don't let it worry, you guys. We got time for another win. Johnny, my sister's coming right away. We can't. Scores tied. My side's got less licks. Okay, fellas. Butter up. London. Barrel organs and the changing of the guard. New York. Jukeboxes and the Decoration Day Parade. London. Cinema and the pantomime. New York. Movies and Broadway. Yes, London and New York. So different and yet so alike. The language the same and yet different. Pull me a right one, lady. Right across the place, sonny. Now knock it out of the ballpark. The people different and yet the same. There's a deep relationship between these two great ports, these great capitals of commerce, between London and our town. That's why tonight we tell some tales of these two cities, or better, of the men and women working in them, working for their neighbors even before themselves. Good tales because they're simple and they're true. Tonight we speak of hope because we speak of children, of those sons and daughters growing in our midst, upon whose shoulders we shall cast the future of this world we hope they'll live in. So many different men and women cry out today, in newspapers and great orations, spreading words out through open microphones. They speak of futures, of peace and of freedom, of hope and bright tomorrows. But all the while, tomorrow watches them through shining youthful eyes. Tomorrow's here, today. And we must know it, serve it, in the persons of our coming generation. And perhaps, quite humbly, say, we've made a mess. We hope we still have time to clear it all away, and pass on to you a world that's fresh, clear, and forever free. Yes, tomorrow's here, with us tonight. I'm Paul. I'm William. I'm Haig. I'm Hendrick. I'm Mary. And I'm Anne. Six bright, clear voices, sounding forth tomorrow. But there's a seventh, too. There's only six. Sure, only six. Can't you count, mister? Sure I can count. And I tell you some, there are seven of you here. Then what's his name? Oh, is it a she? You've struck it, Henrik. It's a she. She's English. Lives across 3,000 miles of open water. But her spirit's here. And in a moment, you shall hear her voice, telling what she's doing in this total war, that children, too, must help to fight. Listen now, the six of you, and all the unseen audience. Listen to the voice of one who knows what war is really like. Have you ever heard the sound of an air raid? An actual air raid? Listen. Listen. And the sea dalla routine armor. Bec vital to a quiet soggy.YANKAYE avat Yes, that's what it sounds like when the bombs come. That weird confusion of noise was not manufactured in a broadcasting studio. It's the actual sound of an air raid recorded in London during the blitz. It serves as the signature of a unique series of programs recorded in Britain by the people themselves, sent to America and now broadcast for the first time. In these programs, you'll meet men and women of England, friendly human men and women, loving decency, hating violence. Men and women very much like yourselves. Now, we would like to have you meet Susan Watson and Tony Beckford, interviewed by Lindsay McCary in London. Week by week, more members of Britain's civilian population are turned over to the needs of war. More than two-thirds of the boys and men between 14 and 54 are already in the services or war work. Each week, another 20,000 women are taken from their peacetime occupation and put into a war job. And their peacetime work is either left altogether undone, or if it was necessary civilian work, it's shared among housewives, old men and school children. Today, we've got two British civilians to tell you how it works out. The first one is a school girl, Susan Watson. What's your war job, Susan? It's more a lot of little jobs than one special one, Mr. McCary. Well, would you like to tell us some of the little ones? Yes. Well, to begin with, children's nursemaids have all been called up long ago. Now they're working government day nurses. But surely, you don't need a nursemaid, do you, Susan? Me? I should think not. I haven't had a nursemaid since I was one and a half. That's eleven years ago. What I was going to say is that school children have to look after their little brothers and sisters now. Especially if their mothers are doing part-time work. And does that include you? Yes, it does. I've got a little brother and two little cousins all in the same house. Now I have to help back them and feed them, and carry one if they have to go to the air raid shelter. That's quite a responsibility. Yes. It's not so bad now. But when they're worried so bad, I had to remember to put all my own things ready, outside my bedroom door at night. Brown suits, gas masks, and barley sugar. And we also quit getting up. We grabbed one as a baby. Well, that's one real war job. And what else did you do? There's one thing I would like to tell you, that the bigger girls in our school do, which I'd like to do. Yes? What is it? We have a cottage hospital at our village. And it has its own telephone switchboard. You know what that is? Yes, yes, I think so. Every evening, after school, the big girls take it in turn to work the switchboard, and put the telephone calls through. They're awfully good at it. If you ring up, it sounds just like a real telephone go. And do they help in the hospital in other ways? Well, only getting cups of tea and things like that. We learn first aid at school, but we haven't been allowed to practice on real teaching so far. I mean, they're some people who are really ill. I see. What other things do you do? Sometimes I do the shopping. My mammy does part-time work, you see. Isn't that difficult with all those ration books? Not really. The grocery knows everything I forget. Oh. The only difficult thing is to try not to send my own food coupons on. Yes, that is a problem. Another thing that is difficult is that there aren't any errand boys now, because they're all in munitions or something like that. So I have to carry all your own things home from the shop. I take the baby's plan. That's a very good idea. The newspaper boy has gone, too. So I get up at half past six and touch everybody's newspaper. Well, it sounds to me like a very busy life. Well, we make up in other ways. For instance, when it's a very busy time on the farm, like harvest time, we get time off from school to help the farmers. I like that. Well, what do you do to help them? Some of us do potato picking and harvesting. Last year, I did foodpickies. That's the best job of all. I guess you were quite sorry when harvest time was over, didn't you? Yes, we were. But soon after that, it was Christmas. And the top form at school was allowed to help deliver the extra posts, as they couldn't get any extra postmen or postwomen. Well, the only thing I can't understand, Susan, is when you get any time for school. Oh, I get far too much time for work, Mrs. Littan. All the morning and all afternoon. Just the same as tea time. All the things I've told you just take the off-ditch of the day and some of Saturday. Will you be glad to get your spare time to yourself again after the war? In a way. But I must say it's rather nice being asked to do things that are quite serious and really do help. For instance, they're quite mis-need if I forgot to do any of the things I do to help now, because there's nobody else to do them. But after the war, I suppose I'll just tell them to practice music on Saturday morning, and things like that. Just to give them something to do. And that will be quite, quite the same. I'm sure it will. Well, thank you, Susan. Thank you. Well, what do you think, U6? She's not so different from us, really. Of course she's not. And that's a great discovery. She is, yes. Fine, fine. Now, we shall go along with our tale of what is happening in our town. We have seen no sights of little girls gathering their things together and taking babies to the shelters while death rains down and flames are all about. We hope and pray and work and fight that these things may never come to our town. But there's a job to do here, and we've made a fine beginning. We have a plan. We have a director of child and youth services within the Civilian Defense Volunteer Office. Dr. Alice V. Kelleher is her name. The assistant director is Mrs. Joseph R. Swan. And the plan is explained in this way. The primary function of the United States Junior Citizens Service Corps is to give proper credit to boys and girls under 16 for participation in the war effort. Boys and girls under leaders in approved youth groups will receive insignia for service similar to those heretofore given to adult volunteers. Our boys and girls are truly junior partners in the war effort. And I'm glad that they are now to have national recognition as such. Junior partners. There's something good about that name. They share in what is happening now as training for the future which belongs to them. There's something... Yes, that sounds very nice. Nice words, all right. But I've got kids of my own, and I know that getting kids together in a bunch means mischief. Unless they've really got something they can do. Believe me, there is plenty they can do. And they're doing it. These are some of the activities of our junior partners. Junior service and childcare. Junior recreation aides. Junior library aides. Junior salvage committees. Book collectors and... Mighty good salesmen and women when it comes to war bonds and stamps. You mean there are kids doing all those things? You bet there are, madam. Thousands of them. Why, we have letters here. About a year ago, I realized the need of participating more actively in the war effort. At that time, I learned of a day nursery, not far from my home, which was greatly understaffed. It's a day nursery for children whose normal life has been interrupted because of broken homes, fathers in the armed forces, and mothers in war jobs. And so... I'd like to enroll in your childcare course. There's a lot I could learn about that. Certainly, my dear. Just take this application blank and fill it out and you'll find it. And so, the most important thing to remember about storytelling to younger children is that you must never allow their attention to wander. Always keep them interested. Keep the story moving. Lots of action and very, very little dull description. Just the essentials. All right, children. Children, quiet, please. It's time for supper. Yes, ma'am. So you'll all have to come with me and wash up now. All right. Children, quiet, please. Children, quiet, please. It's time for supper. Yes, ma'am. So you'll all have to come with me and wash up now. The things I learned in that course will be valuable in the nursing career that I hope to follow after graduation. The course helped me to better understand children. I spent three weeks on a farm, too, picking the lima bean crop. It was tiring, but I felt as if I had done a real day's work. Well, you just about know my whole life story. So, sincerely yours, Doris Flaxbaum. That's just one story. There are hundreds like it. Tales of young people who wanted to help and first set out to learn how to help. But one lesson that has been learned in this war is make use of the things you have on hand, from clothes to interests and abilities. Examine your hobbies. Perhaps they include something that can make winning this war just a trifle easier. There is one hobby, one interest that appeals to every boy in the nation, let alone the boys from six to 60 in our town. Listen. Recognize that sound? Of course you do. So does Junior. And so does his dad. And so does his dad. Can you see it, Pop? It's still behind the buildings. What's it sound like? Combat or transport? Transport, I guess. Uh-uh. There it goes. Where, Pop? Where? Scooted right over our house. Transport, all right. What type? Regulation. DC-3. Twin engine. Airliner. As long as it wasn't a C-54 or a fortress. I don't mind not seeing so much. Yes, they all love to watch the planes. And they all love to build them too. And so when the Army and Navy aviation schools needed exact models for training purposes, for spotting and anti-aircraft courses... What you doing, guy? Finishing up my motto? What is it, a fortress? Auto-liberator. Don't you know the difference? The way you were holding it, all I could see was the four engines. Couldn't you tell from the tail assembly? I didn't look that far. I know that the liberator has a double tail assembly, while the fortress has a single tail with the stratosphere fin that sleeps right down into the fuselage. Glad you know that. Anyway, there, that's done. Don't be so wise, C. Easy, easy, fellows. Let the flyers do the scrapping. You stick to your jobs. Yes, sir, Mr. Greenberg. I was only kidding. Sure. So was I. Sidney makes swell P-38s, and his zeros are practically perfect. I like this work, Mr. Greenberg. Honest. Sure you do. We all do. It's fun building these little planes. And it's even more fun knowing that we're making them to help with the axis. That's the spirit, son. That's what it takes to really beat them. And some, as young as 14, are serving as builders of airplane models. Believe me, they're good at it. Show me a boy who isn't keen about planes and all that goes with them. A job like that is a responsible job. Of course it is, madam. That's just the point. As the plan puts it, we look primarily for real jobs. Our young men and women don't want play acting. They want jobs entailing genuine community responsibility. Well, I never. And I always thought the only thing that entered a child's bed was where to go and have some fun. Ah, there you're wrong again. You see, some kinds of work is really fun itself. It may be hard work. It may be even monotonous. But still, it's fun. For instance, there are two young ladies who really have been hard at it for some time. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Anne and Mary Bullock. I'm Anne. I'm Mary. Girl Scouts, aren't you? Yes, sir. That's right. And the Girl Scouts are one of those approved youth groups, right? That's right again, sir. Well, now that that's cleared up, this is the story. These two sisters, twins by the way, did all the things, sewing bandages for the Queens County Cancer Committee, work for the Red Cross, first aid courses and a first aid post in school, and some things were just a little different too. Take the draft board work as an example. Mary, you too, Anne. Here's a list of all the men registered with this board who are in the two or three classification. Some are 2A or 2C or 3A or 3B and so on. Yes, sir. What do we do with them? Go through the list and make a new list. Of all the fathers with the number of children each one has. Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Careful. No mistakes now. All set, Mary? Uh-huh. All right. I'll read them all. You copy them down. First, James Abalone, wife and two children. Mm-hmm. David Bach, one child. Mm-hmm. Richard Cazadeen, seven. Huh? Seven kids? Whee! Yes, that's one little job they did. Now, most of you know how the farmers in the neighborhood of our town were desperate for harvest help this summer. Well, 15 girls from the scout troop went off to Red Hook, New York and really went to work. Mary and Ann were along, too. And one night, they were all sleeping out on the porch of the farmhouse. It's cold. My feet are freezing. Well, keep them away from me. Oh! How many blankets do we have on? We each had three blankets, didn't we? Uh-huh. And there are six of us in this bed. Eighteen blankets and we're still freezing. Shh! You know what'll happen if Miss Carson finds us. And I, for one, am not looking for a boiling out. Whose idea we're sleeping on this porch, anyway? I don't know, but I'm not for it tonight. Where can we go? I'm cold. Well, the only place inside the house is a floor, I guess. Then come on, girls. Sleeping on a warm floor is better than freezing out here. Okay, have more. How are you coming, Mary? I can pick this corn fine only. Only once. I'm not too sure which is right and which isn't. You'd better look out for Bill Ashley. Maybe I'd better hide some of this stuff, huh? Maybe. Looks awfully green to me. Here, now. What's going on here? We're doing fine, Bill. That so? That fair ear of corn looks mighty green to me, young'un. That's what I said. Yep. Now, look here, kids. When the tassel, uh, the beard, sort of, on the end of the ear is damp and green and silky, that corn ain't ripe for picking. But when it's dry and brown, then you can pick it. Understand, girls? Yes, sir. That's a real help. Thanks, Bill. We understand, Bill. Now we do. How are you doing, kids? I don't know, Bill. I think this cow's dry. Dry? You city kids better go back to getting your milk from bottles. Why, Bill? Because then you can see when there ain't no more milk in it. Why, that there cow is asking to be milk. How are you doing it? Oh, now that's a real help. Now we do. Now we do. How are you doing? Oh, no. Oh, no. Eventually. Good thing? Well, wait, I'm real keep hearing from sickness. What, what, you three Patty? Am I right out now? Do you think that, Pam? Where are you waking inchusses, Wonka, Sally?" Oh. Now, that's the best. Bailey-space, 고�, Charlie? Oh, Ellen. Again, I don't know some things, honey. Missята,? All right? The economics, Walhr�ו. Well then, going through, apple, apple. This tree expected knows two pounds AND THRATTled, well, no, it was at the hip. The filthy, Richard, is right there. Oh, not enough. This bear is better. Down and with a roundabout motion. See? Like this. They learned a lot, Ann and Mary did. They even had to get the farm truck out of a mud hole one day. Well, that was all part of the game and the job. They're back home now, none the worse for wear. And perhaps a little wiser and working just as hard as ever. We're doing some work at the OPA. They're running the gardens dance club, planning meetings and all that. We had a big dance. The Bums Ball, we called it. Everybody came dressed like a tramp. You know, old clothes, ragged hats and all. There was a prize for the best-dressed bum. He was, too. And a ten-piece band for only $20 a night. Of course they're only 15 and 16 years old, the boys in the band. And they don't play so well yet. But they're getting better all the time. They're getting better all the time. No, not just the boys in the band, but our hopes for tomorrow when we see youngsters like these. Remember what Dr. Kelleher said? They want jobs entailing genuine community responsibility. Two wonderful words, those. Community responsibility. They were said another way thousands of years ago. Love thy neighbor as thyself. Perhaps no other word states so clearly every man's responsibility to his neighbor in a free society. A responsibility reflected in every angle of the CDVO. From air wardens to... Yes, to the youth service. For in that youth service, we are permitting our youngsters to literally find themselves and their neighbors. You heard four voices a short time ago. Listen to them again. I'm Paul. I'm William. I'm Hague. I'm Hendrick. Those four boys range from 11 to 13 years of age. They ran the journalism product of the Stitt Junior High School. In other words, they publish a newspaper. Take over, boys, and publish. This is a little different from a newspaper. This is radio. I think we can handle it. Maybe like the March of Time. What do you mean, Bill? What's up? What's on your mind? We want to tell the story of what went on at Sid, don't we? Right. Yeah, that's right. Okay, let's tell it. What do we do first? Let's set it up like we dummied a newspaper. You know, columns and departments. Then we've got to tell the activity list first. Right. First is the newspaper. It's called On the Spot, and it carries all the news. We write it and dummy it and cut the stencils and mimeograph it and put it out all ourselves. We reach about 500 people with it. Then there's boxing and baseball, singing and dramatic, artwork and military strategy. We and Eisenhower. Homey Piers and Swimming. Good. That's the list of things kids can do at Stitt. Now we've got special events. Boy, and how. You know, Mrs. Roosevelt was there. She had a swell idea. All the gang wanted her autograph, so she signed the stencil of our newspaper. Now everybody has a copy of her autograph. And we're publishing a new autograph every week. That's right. Our autograph of the week. Uh-huh. Saves us a lot of writing, too. Builds up the whole bottom of the page. And what about the Duke? You bet. Duke Ellington was there. And Miss Jean Muir. You know, the movie actress. And Nubal Ma spoke to the assembly board. He's president of the city council. Know what he said about the Stitt School program when the on-the-spot reporter interviewed him? Listen to this. It's a wonderful opportunity for you boys and girls to show us older folks that you're capable of leadership. That's all right. But we've got to get some girls. One, anyway, on the paper. Yes. You see, we want to start a domestic page. Home economics. Takes a girl to do that. Then we can run recipes, kitchen hints, price lists. We run price lists now. That's right. We sent out a couple of fellows, and they look at the prices in the stores around our way. And then we published the list with the ceiling prices and all, so that everybody who reads on the spot can show their mothers, and everyone can save money. We're working on the war effort, too. We found a swell little machine shop up our way. They make parts for the Army and Navy. Just a little place. But they've got a swell slogan on the wall. It says, every second counts. That's a slogan for all Americans. That's the way I wrote it up in the paper. There's a lot of things we can do up at Stitt. We've got in scrap salvage. We have sort of a nightclub. Jukebox for music. The kids do the shows. It's a swell place to go to, and it's just for us. Nobody bothers us. There used to be a lot of fellows who liked to start rough stuff. But now, everybody sort of pulls together. We're doing everything we can to help the war. Selling bonds and stamps and all of that. That's important, too. Best part is the four of us on the planning committee. We started the paper, and we've got eight fellows already. And we're growing all the time. We're going to have an eight-page paper one of these days. You'll wait and see. You bet we'll wait and see, boys. And you'll have it, too. You see, they're growing all the time. They're working at becoming citizens. They're learning how to live next door to each other, regardless of race or creed, by the best of all ways. By actually living next door to each other. This is the sort of thing this war is all about. This is why London took the bombs. And why New Yorkers buy bombs. For this, the shining enthusiasm of youth is our hope for tomorrow. Here with us tonight. I'm Paul. I'm William. I'm Hayes. I'm Hendrick. I'm Mary. And I'm Anne. Yes. All the while tomorrow's watching us. With shining, youthful eyes. It falls to us to say to them, with humbleness perhaps, We've made a mess. We hope we still have time to work and fight. That we may pass on to you a world that's fresh and clean. And soon, forever free. These, then, have been our tales of two cities. Cities separated by miles on miles of tossing ocean, yet joined irrevocably together by the dreams, the hopes, the simple acts of heroism of their millions of little people. We spoke of hope tonight because we spoke of children. You have been listening, ladies and gentlemen, to Tales of Two Cities, written and directed by Ira Marion for the Civilian Defence Volunteer Office, with Al Gough as the narrator, supported by Sterling Chesildine, John Galt, Stephen White, Sheila Tanshin, Winifred App, and Betty Jean Hertz. Our special guests tonight were Paul Plummer, William Plummer, Haig Ellion, and Hendrick Smith of the Stitt Junior High School, and Mary and Anne Bullock of Forest Hills, all of whom played themselves. Tonight's story, based on the activities of the youth service in New York City, is the last of these Tales of Two Cities. Tales of Two Cities. Tales of Two Cities Now here is a bit of a...
