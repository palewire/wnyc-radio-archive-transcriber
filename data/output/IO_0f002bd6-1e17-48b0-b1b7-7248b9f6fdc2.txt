Oh, pray somebody's a-goin' to rob them out without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? What for? I've got no mule, I've got no mule, I've got no mule, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to be, for the things that are tied like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my tongue, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gals, got my gals, got my lor, got my lor, got my tongue. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got the sun, got the moon, got the people's feet. The folks with plenty of plenty, got to pray all the day. I've got plenty of plenty, I've got to keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, getting a time to ride. Never want me long in the world, never want me strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my tongue, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it?
