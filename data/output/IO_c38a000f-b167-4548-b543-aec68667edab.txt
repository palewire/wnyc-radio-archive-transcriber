Paul, we've been waiting for you. I was detained, Father. Uh, Joan, this is Paul. Hello. Hello. Oh, Father, an English spy is being executed at Saint-Bissin tomorrow, at dawn. He'd know where I could reach the British intelligence. A priest could speak to him. I understand, Paul. I am to be advanced sent by dawn. You will, Father? I shall try. Until tomorrow, my children, God be with you. I know this seems all very strange to you, Joan. Father, aren't one approved. It must be all right. Now I must return to work. Oh, Joan. Would you mind if I stayed here until you came back? Here? I've nowhere else to go, Joan. I'm so tired. I haven't slept for a long time. But I... I'll go whenever you ask me to. I think that would be all right, Paul. Thank you, Joan. It's morning, Paul. Morning? But why didn't you wake me? Wait. May I have my arm, please? Your arm? Oh, I'm sorry. That's better. I tried to fix your pillow while you slept, and just then you turned over on my arm. And you sat there all night with your arm pinned under my shoulder? You were so tired. I didn't want to wake you up. May I come in? It's Father Antoine. Oh, yes, Father. Come in. Good morning, my children. All pencil and paper. Over here. Here. This stuff will do. Did you see him, Father? Yes. I saw him. Heaven rest his soul. And? Someone must take this note. 24 Rue Laraine. Ask for Mademoiselle Rosé. There it is. Thank you, Father. 24 Rue Laraine. I'll go. Wait. You mustn't go. You've been watched. Yes. Yes, it's true. Will you go, Father? I would, and gladly. But I fear they suspect me too now. Then who could... Perhaps Joan knows of someone we can trust. We mustn't involve Joan in this, Father. She's involved already. Well, I shall leave it to you, Paul. Goodbye. You're in trouble, aren't you? Yes. The note must be very important. Very. Well, if I'm the only one that can take the note, you must give it to me. No, no, no, Joan. This is my affair. If Father Antoine thinks it is all right for me to carry the note, it must be so. Let me take it, Paul. I want to. All right, Joan. Take it. Tally-ho. What is that? Oh. The British flyers say that to each other before going into action. What does it mean? It means a lot to them. Good luck. Good fellowship. Got to go with you. Tally-ho, Joan. Joan. Thank heaven you are back. The Gestapo followed me. They... You're hurt. They shot at you. Nothing. Only my hand. Paul, Mademoiselle Rosé said that you must be under the Louis-Philippe Bridge tonight. At the outlet of the sewer at two o'clock in the morning. Maybe something I can tear up into a bandage, Joan? Wait. Let me finish, Paul. A stolen, nuddy patrol boat will be waiting for you and your friends. It will take you to the British seaplane. Oh, good. How does your hand feel, though? It doesn't hurt, Paul. But if it did, then you care, though. I would think that you love me. Perhaps a little. I do love you, Joan. Then I'm more than glad I did. It was worth everything. But, Paul, you're going to England. You're going away from me. Yes, Joan, I must. Why? Well, Joan, I must tell you, I... I'm a free French flyer fighting with the British. I was shot down with four of my men and we came here for help. Tonight we are going back. Oh, but not you, Paul. The others, but not you. You've done enough. No one has done enough, Joan, until victory is won. I don't want you to go, Paul. I'll come back, Joan. You will? And when I do, the lights will burn again, Paris. Yes. Old women will sell balloons on the steps of Notre Dame. Little children will laugh at the marionettes in the chillies. The moon will shine. And lovers will walk hand in hand in the peaceful evenings. We'll do that, Paul, won't we? Yes, Joan. But suppose not, Paul. Suppose... Oh, don't go. Don't go back. To make our dream come true, I must go, Joan. And I must count the hours until you go. So few of them are left for us. Now, Paul. Now. Good night, Joan. Goodbye. Be careful. They're watching. Tally-ho, Joan. Tally-ho, Paul. Paul. Stick is that way. He's following me. Falling right behind. Got to shake him off. Got to run away for him. That's it. Run. Run away from him. Run. Faster. Run. Faster. Faster. Still following. Still following. Can't run away from him. Got to shake him off. Got to outwit him. Outwit him somehow. A horse cab. Get in horse cab. Wait, driver. Wait. All right, driver. Go ahead. Go ahead as fast as you can. Go ahead. Falling. He's still following me. Can't run away from him. Can't shake him off. Got to kill him. Yes, kill him. Turn that corner. Hide in his doorway. And when he turns the corner, then... Got to. It's his life or mine. I'm going to die. Good evening, mademoiselle. What are you doing in my room? Who are you? My name is Funk. I, uh... I have some small connection with the Gestapo. What do you want? Someone slipped this note under your door when you were away. I escaped, but too late. Till the lamps of Paris burned once more. Paul. See for yourself. Yes. Well? This note is written on a taper provided for lighting candles at church shrines. Your Paul is therefore hiding in the church across the street. Unless you help us find his friends, he will be captured and shot within the week. And so will you for shielding him. No? And if I help you, you won't kill him? Or you. My word of honor. I will tell Paul to go to his friends. Good. You mustn't follow him, though, because then he won't go near them. I'll take you to the rendezvous by a rude eye. How do I know you'll keep your words? Because I was forced to live. I'm ready here, Funk. Paul. Joan. I had to speak to you. I didn't make it, Joan. I'll get out of Paris somehow. I'll go to some other village in the south where I won't be recognized. You will come to me. We'll be married, Joan. I'd like that. More than anything in the world. But you're going back to England. Joan. Listen to me. Your friends are still waiting for you. But they had to leave it, too. When I saw you were being followed, I knew you'd be late. I went to them and told them. They'll wait for you until four. But what about you, Joan? Until tonight, I... I thought it was only I who needed you. But I... I thought of what you said. Friends need you more than I do, Paul. I'll come back, Joan. When the lights of Paris burn again. Go quickly. Now. Tally-ho, Paul. Tally-ho, Joan. Paul. Well, mademoiselle, shall we go? Ah, a sewer of all places. Are we soon there? Stop here. Lassen Sie halten. You must be very quiet as the men are to be caught. Where? Where are we? Under the Westen-Eyed Bridge. What time is it? A few seconds before four o'clock. Then we must wait. It's not quite time. What's that? It's what we were waiting for. They're the wonder. They are escaping. Fire at them. Ah! Enough! Stop! They have gotten away. Captain, arrest this woman. You can arrest me, yes. But they've gotten away. They are free. Men like that will always be free. Tally-ho, Paul! Tally-ho! And now I yield to the words and music of our lovely singing star, Nadine Conner. Time made my family between But what has been in us forgetting This sweet memory But what has been in us I've been in us I've been in us
