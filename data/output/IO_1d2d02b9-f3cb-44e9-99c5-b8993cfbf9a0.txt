Good afternoon from the South Lawn of the White House grounds in Washington, D.C. Here we are to witness a traditional part of the American Yuletide scene, the 25th annual lighting of the National Community Christmas Tree. Ladies and gentlemen, the United States Marine Band is about to play Hail to the Chief. Hail to the Chief has just heralded the arrival of the President of the United States to the South Lawn of the White House here in Washington, D.C., as we are to witness the 25th annual lighting of the National Community Christmas Tree. People have come in throngs to watch their Chief Executive light this living Christmas tree and to hear his seasonal message. And now, for introductions, Mr. Justice Prettyman. Let our audience rise. Monsignor John K. Cartwright, director of St. Matthew's Cathedral, will pronounce the invocation. O God, thou Father of all light, grant us to begin at this moment a happy Christmas. Grant that through and after Christmastime, we may carry with us the secret of lasting happiness, because through the celebration of this holy day, we shall have seen its meaning for our souls. Our first citizen kindles here the light that flashes forth in an instant to give the signal of rejoicing to his fellow citizens throughout the land. May the goodwill it raise and kindle be the sanction and guarantee of peace on earth. May the light of thy word flash over our land and over all the world to draw souls to its radiance. May it enlighten minds and gladden hearts. May the birthday of the Lord, who came down from heaven to be one with us, make us ascend in spirit to the heavenly realms of goodness and justice and peace and love that are his and our true dwelling place. And may that spiritual power cause us to be the messengers of righteousness and goodwill to each other and to all mankind. Amen. Amen. Mr. President, Mrs. Truman, Miss Truman, ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys, tomorrow is Christmas. At our house, ever since I was a very small boy, it has been a day of surprise and tremendous excitement. Even now, though the youngest in our household is well past the age when he can vote, tonight, we will all hang out stockings for Santa Claus. Not a package has been opened. In the morning, we will get up at exactly quarter past six, just as children always want to do, to see what the old fellow has brought us. And the youngest, although he is now the biggest, must go downstairs first. And the oldest, which is I, must go last. And so on through the day. It is proper that Christmas should be a children's holiday because each new generation has first right to reach for the sort of world this day represents. But the fact is that Christmas is the most adult celebration on the world's calendar. By it, we commemorate the birthday of one who came to bring the most important thought ever presented to the minds of man. He came to say that God is love. God, the intelligent creator of the universe and all that is in it, including us, is love. Not like the love of a boy for a dog or of a girl for a doll or of a man for a woman or of a mother for her son, but the love of a father for his children. A stern affection tempered with justice, but nevertheless, love. It is a curious thing that the world vigorously pursues the things it loathes and hesitates to insist upon the things it wants so badly. Almost all people everywhere hate war and cruelty, injustice, greed, and poverty. Men everywhere long for peace and happiness and justice and service. But we act as if we were caught helpless in a vast corded net from which there is no escape. It is not so. It is an evident fact as certain as the physical existence of this tree that the strands in which we are tangled would dissolve like gossamer threads if mankind would accept the thought that Jesus came to teach. To the hopelessness and despair that assail our adult world, Christmas represents the answer. And so we celebrate tomorrow with singing and ringing of bells and presents and bright lights and much gab. In a moment, the President of the United States will light the lights of our national community Christmas tree. It is not a mere neighborhood pleasantry that he does so. It is an act of great significance. It signifies that the adult people of the United States celebrate the birthday of the one who came to teach that all men are the children of the same father who loved them. And now the people of Washington want to present their greetings to the President and Mrs. Truman and Ms. Truman. For that purpose, we have two representatives present. The first is Ms. Mary Frances Hurley who comes from Troop 289 of the Girl Scouts of the District of Columbia. Ms. Hurley. We are honored as representatives of the girls of our nation to share in the shuletide custom lighting the national Christmas tree. We hope that as the light from this tree enters our hearts, we will feel kindly toward all men and share our wonderful plenty with less fortunate people so that the world may move nearer to peace on earth, goodwill to men. To you, Mrs. Truman, and to Ms. Margaret Truman, we bring our friendly wishes for a merry, merry Christmas. On behalf of the committee, Ms. Hurley, I wish to thank you for your part in our program and may I wish you a very merry Christmas. The other representative bringing greetings is Kenneth McDonald, an Eagle Scout from Troop 144 of the Boy Scouts of the District of Columbia. Kenneth. Mr. President, I am honored to represent the Boy Scouts and the youth of America at this ceremony. In these trying times of world's suffering and unrest, we reaffirm our desire to be of all service possible in our nation's program to reduce suffering and to create goodwill among all peoples. You may be sure of our loyalty and we extend to you our very best wishes for a merry Christmas and a happy new year. Kenneth, on behalf of the committee, I thank you very much for taking part in our program. Merry Christmas to you. We are now to hear the Central High School Glee Club under the direction of Miss L.

If I did not express what I know is the thought of every living American, young and old, at home and abroad, on behalf of them all, I wish you, President Truman, Mrs. Truman, and Ms. Truman, the very merriest Christmas. And now, ladies and gentlemen, friends and neighbors all over the country, the President of the United States. President Truman is about to press the button which will light the gaily decorated Christmas tree here on the south lawn of the White House. And the tree is lighted, and a beautiful tree it is. Many colored lights and the chimes that you hear in the background indicate the lighting of the community Christmas tree here in Washington, D.C., which is symbolic of the lighting of trees across the entire nation in a ceremony that, for 25 years, has been a part of the American scene. As presidents from Calvin Coolidge down to and including President Truman, have lighted the various community Christmas trees. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. My fellow countrymen, we are met on the south lawn of the White House. The Washington Monument, the Washington Monument, the Washington Monument, the Washington Monument. The scene is peaceful and tranquil. The shadows deepen, and the holy night falls gently over the national capital as we gather around our Christmas tree. Down the ages from the first Christmas, through all the years of 19 centuries, mankind, in its weary pilgrimage through a changing world, has been cheered and strengthened by the message of Christmas. The angels sang for joy at the first Christmas in faraway Bethlehem. Their song was echoed through the corridors of time, and will continue to sustain the heart of man through eternity. Let us not forget that the first Christmas was a homeless one. A humble man and woman had gone up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, to Bethlehem. There is a sense of desolation in St. Luke's brief chronicle that Mary brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them at the inn. For many of our brethren in Europe and Asia, this, too, will be a homeless Christmas. There can be little happiness for those who will keep another Christmas in poverty and exile, and in separation from their loved ones. As we prepare to celebrate our Christmas this year in a land of plenty, we would be heartless indeed, if we were indifferent to the plight of less fortunate peoples overseas. We must not forget that our revolutionary fathers also knew a Christmas of suffering and desolation. Washington wrote from Valley Forge, two days before Christmas, in 1777. We have this day no less than 2,873 men in camp, unfit for duty, because they are barefooted and otherwise naked. We can be thankful that our people have risen today, as did our forefathers in Washington's time, to our obligation and our opportunity. At this point in the world's history, the words of St. Paul have greater significance than ever before. He said, and now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three. But the greatest of these is charity. We believe this. We accept it as a basic principle of our lives. The great heart of the American people has been moved to compassion by the needs of those in other lands who are cold and hungry. We have supplied a part of their needs, and we shall do more. In this, we are maintaining the American tradition. In extending aid to our less fortunate brothers, we are developing in their hearts the return of hope. Because of our efforts, the people of other lands see the advent of a new day, in which they can lead lives free from the harrowing fear of starvation and war. With the return of hope to these peoples will come renewed faith. Faith in the dignity of the individual and the brotherhood of man. The world grows old, but the spirit of Christmas is ever young. Happily for all mankind, the spirit of Christmas survives travail and suffering because it fills us with hope of better things to come. Let us then put our trust in the unerring star which guided the wise men to the manger of Bethlehem. Let us hearken again to the angel choir singing, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth good will toward men. With hope for the future, and with faith in God, I wish all my countrymen a very merry Christmas. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. At this time, musician Edward Masters, of the United States Marine Band, is to play Adam's Cantique de Noel on the cornet. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ Thank you, Mr. Masters, for a marvelous performance. May you have a very merry Christmas. Once again, we are now to hear the Central High School choristers. This time they will sing, Silent Night. ¶¶ ¶¶ Silent night, holy night. All is calm, all is bright. Round yon virgin, mother and child. Holy infant, so tender and mild. Sleep in heavenly peace. Sleep in heavenly peace. On behalf of the committee and of all of us here, I thank the caristers for their singing. We wish you, everyone, a very merry Christmas. And now, upon this ceremony, the Right Reverend Angus Dunn, Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Washington, will pronounce the benediction. May the heavenly light which lightened our world on the first Christmas shine throughout this land. May the peace which cometh from above on men of goodwill dwell in all our hearts. May the spirit of him whose holy birth we celebrate bind us together in a free and brotherly common life. May the blessing of almighty God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be and abide with all our people this day and evermore. Amen.
