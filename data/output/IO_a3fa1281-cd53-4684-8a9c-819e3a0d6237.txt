He's only a man in a fearless day. A beautiful sight to see. You may think he's happy and free from care. He's not the most he seems to be. He's done when you think of a wasted life. For you shall not make me wait. And her beauty was sold for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a gilded day. A little brown car, a shady green spot. No happier home I find. My heart's barely gone.

The Christian's name come to her home we go. All of white and all of them they love us all. All his joy is, as I am true, I know. Here's the first night of paradise. Two little girls in blue, lads. Two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lads. Who won your father's car. Became your mother. I married the other. But we have ripped her apart. She was bred in old Kentucky. Where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country. In her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I'm true. Come, rat, come, rat. Ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrows. Sharing each other's joy. Come, rat, come, rat. Day, turn. Ward, let. Lay in high. Give me the price and chance to grow your hands. I will not let you hand away with me. And today she will let me ritly now.
