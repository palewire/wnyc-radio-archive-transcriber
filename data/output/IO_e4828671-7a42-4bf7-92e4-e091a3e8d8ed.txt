Good morning ladies and gentlemen, we're speaking to you from LaGuardia Field Municipal Airport, the city of New York, where we are awaiting momentarily the arrival of the C-54 transport plane, which will bring General Dwight D. Eisenhower to the greatest of cities. There has been some delay, obviously because of poor weather conditions between here and Washington, but we have everything in readiness for his arrival. As a matter of fact, a few C-54 planes came in, and of course everybody around would start to wonder whether or not that was the plane which was bearing the famous General. We do have time to tell you that all plans as arranged will go on since the weather. While it is a dark day and one which is threatening weather, we are assured that there will not be rain, and so if you want to see the General, you still have plenty of time to get out along the long route and see him. When he does arrive here, of course, there will be ceremonies which we'll describe for you. The General will then head a 25-car motorcade, which will go along Grand Central Parkway here in Queens, across Triborough Bridge, and to Manhattan at 122nd Street. The Cortez will then proceed south on the East River Drive to 96th Street, then went to 5th Avenue, north to 102nd Street, and into Central Park. It will go north on the park's East Drive to the 103rd Street Cross Drive, then west to the West Drive, south to 72nd Street, and across the park to the East Drive, south to 5th Avenue, emerging at 60th Street. Then, of course, it will go down south on 5th Avenue to 23rd Street, switching over to Broadway, and down Broadway to 14th Street, east to the East River Drive, and south to South Ferry, then north on Broadway to City Hall. The ceremonies at City Hall are expected to handle about 40,000 persons. General Eisenhower will speak there, and Mayor Ligotti, who is attendant here, will present a special gold medal, which was struck for this occasion as a gift from this city. And incidentally, we might mention that this medal was struck off in record time. The official party is expected to leave City Hall about 12.40, which would make it about 10 minutes late, and head for the mayor's home, which is Gracie Mansion in Carl Schertz Park. There, the mayor will be host to a private luncheon for the general. And that trip is expected to take about 45 minutes. We can tell you that the police arrangements leaving here at Ligotti Field to New York City will find them proceeding at a speed of 35 miles an hour. When they hit New York City, they will move at a pace of 20 miles per hour, and upon emerging from Central Park, will hit parade speed, which is 2 miles per hour. In the event that you're unable to get a look at this cortege, which will be moving to City Hall, you may have the opportunity of getting a look at it as it moves from City Hall to Gracie Mansion. That cortege will move north on Center Street to Lafayette and Spring Streets, then north on Lafayette to 4th Street, west to Washington Square, through the Washington Arch, and north on 5th Avenue to 23rd Street. Then west to 7th Avenue, north to Broadway at 43rd Street, then to 86th Street, and east on 86th Street, and through Central Park on the transverse road to 5th Avenue and 85th Street. North to 86th Street, east to East End Avenue, and north to Gracie Mansion. And of course, at 2.30, when the luncheon is over, General Eisenhower hopes to head to the Polar Grounds to see the baseball game between the New York Giants and the Boston Braves. And that route will be west to 1st Avenue, north to 116th Street, west to 7th Avenue, north to 151st Street, west to 8th Avenue, north to the Polar Grounds, and into the Polar Grounds. Of course, we can well appreciate that since the General has been overseas for so long, and he himself, as American as baseball, wants to see the great national pastime. The plans, which had been originally set up in case the weather was bad and rainy, are being completely disregarded now since we have the assurance that the weather will hold out. It is not a clear, sunshiny day. It has been threatening rain all morning. As a matter of fact, some three hours ago when we passed Ligartia Field, the sun was coming out intermittently, and it did look as if we might have a very strong shower. However, that has blown by, and while it is dark, it is cool, there's a crowd here lining the upper and lower boardwalks, which is about five deep, and thousands of American schoolchildren have American flags in their hands and are all set and ready to yell and wave as only they can when the General's plane reaches this field. We expect that in this party there will be three C-54 transport planes. Directly in front of the administration building is a huge platform which has been erected solely for the benefit of the photographers and for the greeting party. And out there at the moment, rather nervously, and perhaps as only he so energetically can do it, is the mayor, and he's walking around with that familiar big sombrero which he wears. Grover Whalen, who is acting with and for the mayor in greeting the General, is also out there, and they're all waiting for this moment when this plane will arrive. To the northern part of the field, there is a C-54 transport plane which is pulled in, loaded with cargo, and that has been sidetracked so that we do expect the General's plane to arrive here momentarily. Perhaps a word picture of the way we are strung out here. On field at the present moment is the Fort J Band, and the escort, the Guard of Honor, will be the 716th Military Police Battalion, and they are quartered at 4650 Broadway with Lieutenant Colonel Jack Williams commanding. They went through a few gyrations here and are now at parade rest, all lined up with a Fort J Band, and as each plane flies overhead, despite the fact that in many cases it may be just a one-motor plane, everybody, the youngsters especially, seem to think that it might be a C-54. The field has 25 cars set up here in a motorcade. The first line is five cars, the second 10 and the third 10. To the southern part of the field and to the right of hangar number one is a complete motorcycle escort for the official party, and there are exactly 100 motorcycles. In the official greeting party will be Mayor LaGuardia, Mr. Whalen, Lieutenant General Grunet, who heads the Eastern Defense Command, Vice Admiral Leary, who is the Eastern Sea Frontier Commander, Major General Terry, the head of the Second Service Command, Rear Admiral Kelly, the commander of the 3rd Naval Division, Major General Groninger of the New York Port of Embarkation, and Major General Francis O'Driscoll, the commanding general of the 1st Air Force fighter groups, and you'll remember that he headed to the 8th Air Force in Europe under Eisenhower, so that he especially here is anxious to greet his former commanding general. We are to the right of the administration building on a ramp which leads from the upper boardwalk, as are all other stations which are originating this broadcast. Directly below us and running far to our right are scores of military police. They are stationed here to prevent the crowds from breaking out, rushing on the field. The runway is the number one runway, and we have three dismounting ladders so that if the plane stops at any near any one of them, they can rapidly be moved into position so that there will be no delay in getting General Eisenhower and his group from the plane. Well, every time that they see a play, they think it is a C-54, and now here do come a group through the gray. The gray miss. We can see three huge planes, and they are C-54s. You probably can hear in the background the yells from the youngsters who are screaming, and we understand that these planes will circle the field and then come in for a landing, and they are four-motored C-54 transport planes. One has a tremendous lead, and so we expect that General Eisenhower will land in about five minutes. The guard of honor is in position. The band is in position. They will move from directly in front of us right to the dismounting ladder, and you can hear this huge transport plane as it cuts around, goes over the field, and moves in, and here come two more which are at least a mile behind, and they are separated by about a quarter of a mile. Four army cars and two navy cars are to our right, and they, of course, are the welcoming generals which we've indicated will be Generals Grunet, Terry, and Groninger, and Hunter, and two navy cars which have Admiral Leary and Admiral Kelly. Things become quite silent again as these planes go to the south, and we can tell you that a huge group of Red Cross workers are here, and they have a huge sign, each one carrying a letter to the right of us. It spells out welcome, and to the left of us it spells out home. Welcome home to General Eisenhower. Everything here is in complete readiness for any eventuality. We have ambulances, crash cars parked just in case anything goes wrong and nobody is taking any chances. To the western side of ramp number one are three saluting guns, and there gun crews are stationed there waiting to see in the moment that these planes will land why you will hear the reverberations in the background. Planes are lined up to the far side of the field. There's one yellow Piper, a Thunderbolt fighter, a single fighter, an Army gyroplane which blew up loads of dust before it finally settled and practically drove the gun crews from their positions. It's landed directly alongside of them. The planes have now disappeared into this mist and we can tell you that LaGuardia Field is situated to the eastern end of Queens County in New York City. We're bordering Flushing Bay which is used for amphibious and seagoing planes to take off. To the direct north is Long Island Sound and of course the man-made island which is in the center out there. We're waiting now to see if we can spot these planes and here comes a plane in and out of the mist. We'll keep our eyes on it. It's dropping now. It's about 500 feet and he's coming in to make a landing on the far ramp which is the spot where the C-54 transport with cargo is stationed and we spoke to that about and now here is one plane coming in. It is a C-54 a four-motor plane. The other two planes have disappeared in the darkness. And we don't know whether or not this may be the general. There doesn't seem to be any great indication and we're looking for the numbers 9-1-1 on the tail of the plane which indicate that it is General Eisenhower's plane and that of course is the same plane which made history by taking President Roosevelt to Yalta and back. An air of expectancy is running through the officials who are awaiting the general and as each plane nears why the police just keep rushing out to the front get the people away and make sure there is no interference. The motorcycle police apparently expect the plane to land at any moment because they have gone to their motorcycles and are stationed there. The weather is perhaps an excellent day for a parade because it is not too bright not too hot not too humid but it is dark and it is cool at any rate it is cool here out at LaGuardia Field. The police two hours ago cleared Grand Central Parkway and were preparing to shunt traffic and about every 100 feet there was a police officer. We understand that just about two-thirds of the entire police department has been called out to supervise the parade for General Eisenhower. Now another C-54 transport plane is pulling in and we still are awaiting that third one but apparently none of these planes at the moment are bringing General Eisenhower. One thing which particularly made a great impression upon us was the policing out here they're very strict certain areas are set off and there's been no great effort at regimentation. We noticed rather oddly too that not only are the policemen out in force but the police women are here in force and not only is the army represented here by the enlisted men and of course officers but also many WACs stationed here at LaGuardia Field are out to get a quick look at the General. And here comes another C-54 plane the third of the group that we thought were coming in and here comes one plane down now it's pulling in with two motors cut out and two going and he is being shunted off he's not going to come up this way he's going up a side ramp. First plane is taxiing off to the side and the third plane has landed and possibly that might be the one and we certainly hope there's another one which is now coming in a fourth plane will also come in a C-54 transport a fourth one is just emerging from the dusk and setting down to land and it's amazing how they come out of this what apparently is a gray mist over Long Island Sound and how quickly it can emerge and when it does emerge it's about 300 feet above the water and that plane is now coming in and will hit the far end of the ramp now four of them have three of them have landed four are coming in two are on the field and you may be sure there's a great deal of confusion as to just which one is General Eisenhower's plane and now another one is coming in a fifth C-54 comes out of the murkiness and the second of the five planes is being sent to the side let's see one is being wheeled around and this looks as if it may be that the plane has made a complete circle of the field rolling and it is being led in by a small tractor the kind that usually haul them out and this may be General Ike coming in now the plane has made a complete circle and is pulling in it is taxiing in two motors cut out one moving up and it's a Douglas C-54 and this is it there's the 911 the familiar number and the name of the plane is the Sunflower and it is being flagged in by one of the ATC men it's the number is 4911 it has a red symbol with five planes on it it is now taxiing up to the dismounting ladder and you can be sure that it will be a terrific roar as General Eisenhower steps out of this plane there's the plane cutting out it's other motors the door is opened and the dismounting ladder is being moved out and we're waiting to see whether or not the General will emerge first we imagine that it will that he will plane was 16 minutes late in getting in and the General is standing there in the doorway Ligardi is standing on the inner border of the line and here he comes and there's the roar that goes up from the crowd there's the shots in the background the salute two of them two of them three of them the salutes for General Eisenhower who has just arrived in New York City and there is the General shaking hands vigorously all around introducing his aides Captain Harry Butcher of the Navy and you can hear in the background that the salute are still going off and the third plane is being wheeled around and here comes the General from the plane the General a very robust figure with his chest really puffed out walking energetically with the Mayor and finally the Mayor faces the military police battalion and the Fort J Band and the General is looking over this way he's flanked on the left by Admiral Leary on the right by Lieutenant General Grunet and he is standing alongside of Mayor LaGuardia and the band strikes up and plays the Star Spangled Banner it is Ruffles and Flourishes and we assume that they will break into the Star Spangled Banner the photographers of Army and Navy news services are taking pictures of the General and he stands at attention with the Mayor taking his hat off holding it on his chest and we've just heard Ruffles and Flourishes by the Fort J Band the military police are now at attention the band plays the General walks past them with Colonel Williams who leads the military police and the band now is playing the General's March and the General Generalized now walks past them takes a good look at them he is dressed in suntans not in any battle jacket which he had a great hand in devising and he salutes the stars and stripes and the flag of the city of New York very smartly looks them over tells commanding General Luton here's another cheer for him the General really looks them over he's marched completely around them he's going now towards the back of them and he is engaged in earnest conversation with Colonel Jack Williams who heads the military police and now he's moving to the far side which is towards the ramp from which he has just arrived the four planes have brought the officers and men of General Eisenhower in the enlisted men are going by and one of them is Mickey McKeel who lives practically a stone's throw from here at LaGuardia Field he lives in Corona which is just about one half mile south of LaGuardia Field and the General still takes a look and there's a whole barrage of photographers in front of him as he goes around and now he is being led over he stops for just a brief moment he stops for a brief moment to talk with General Grunner and now he is being led by Mayor LaGuardia and he has a grin on his face just a mile wide the famous Eisenhower grin and he stops for a moment introduces some of his officers to those of the commanding generals of this the Second Service Command the Eastern Defense Command and Captain Harry Butcher is being introduced to Mayor LaGuardia he is the naval aide of General Eisenhower and the General in true American fashion he is so excited and so nervous that he pulls out a cigarette and lights it up and now the photographers move in to take snapshots often there's a crowd here at LaGuardia Field of about 15,000 one hour ago it had been up to 10,000 but they were pouring in there were five deep they're much deeper than that and of course there's a huge number of them on the lower ramp the military police that are stationed here at LaGuardia Field are forming along the inner ridge of the ramp getting a look at the General he is completely smothered now by photographers and newspaper men who are around him and as all of his men surrounding him all his officers are surrounding him and the men who came in on the second, third and fourth planes have gone to the cars in the motorcade each of them has a ticket which tells him what car he's in what seat he's in in the car I'd like to remind you that our coverage will also include spots in New York as this motorcade moves down to City Hall LaGuardia is introducing his aide Jim Hawken to the General the General salutes to him offhand fashion he's standing there that big smile on his face he's well tanned and again the photographers are just snapping that famous Eisenhower smile as he stands there's no doubt that the General is pleasingly embarrassed at this tremendous reception which he has received there's a huge number of military personnel here a major comes over he wants some more of these military police out there because the crowd which is getting out around Eisenhower is a bit unmanageable and the motorcade is getting ready to take General Eisenhower to New York City where the major portion of the reception will be made at City Hall so if you are along the route of travel and would like to see General Eisenhower you certainly have plenty of time to get there and to see him America's great hero who was commanding general in the European Theater of Operations the highest honor that any American general has ever had and certainly his operation in Europe the invasion the greatest military operation of all time June you know has been a lucky month for Eisenhower he graduated 30 years ago from West Point and it was three years ago that he was given the assignment as commanding general in the European Theater of Operations it was June 1944 that saw him invade successfully Europe and it was June that sees him now return home he's a Texan by birth he's lived in Kansas but New York City has taken him to its heart and today he has invaded New York City he's captured the place without a shot being fired and everybody just willingly capitulating to him he's now going to the car the motorcycles have started up and the millions of people in New York City in just a few moments will be able to see him he's now climbing into the car he and the mayor will be in car number one and in car number two will be General Walter Bedell Smith and Grover Whalen in car three will be Admiral Kirk and the Honorable C.R. Beasley Car number four will be Major General Harold Bull and Major General Littlejohn and in car five Major General Schlater and General Thomas Davis and here is car number one and a soldier runs out and shakes the General's hand the General shakes it very vigorously the car has the New York City emblem on the left in the front also has the New York City flag on the left the General smiles and waves they ask him to wave he does he waves he smiles and that grin hasn't left his face from that moment when he so nervously stepped from the C-54 plane which is ready to be towed away on the right side of the car is a red flag with five silver stars on it and again the photographers swarm in on top of the General and some of the men in attendance here have gone over and shaken hands with the General and he very energetically shakes hands with him he shakes hands as if he means it and he does of course they're keeping everybody away from him now the motorcycles are starting to move away the car is moving away it circles around it heads now for New York City over the Triborough Bridge and that's just about all that there is from here at LaGuardia Field and they're all lined up now the cars are pulling out and General Eisenhower is on his way to New York City that's all from LaGuardia Field we return you to our studios our next point of vantage in the parade on this historic General Light day will be 5th Avenue at 60th Street which we'll bring you just as soon as we can now meantime we'll have the BBC morning special at 10.30 for you until that time here is some recorded music appropriate for the day clear clear contact contact off we go into the wild blue yonder climbing high into the sun here they come zooming to meet our thunder Adam boys give us a grunt down we dive spouting our planes from under off with one terrible roar we live in fame walker down in flame nothing will stop the Army Air Corps here's a toast to the host of those who love the past and love us high to a friend we will send the message of his brother men will cry we drink to those who gave them all a boat then down we rode before the rain was hot a golden toast and the host of men we boat the Army Air Corps and the interim air is well in the in the fourth wage and the the closed and there karenaestab Here we are on the northwest corner of 40th and 5th Avenue in New York City, and it's really a jam-packed corner this morning. Right above us, we're on platform 1. Right above us on platform 2, there are at least 25 photographers taking pictures of this tremendous crowd. The crowd is, in all aspects, tremendous and very, very quiet, calm, peaceful. They're not making very much noise. You probably can't hear too much of it behind me, but it is very, very large. The streets are absolutely jammed. There is just a single file of people going back and forth along the rear of the crowd, which is standing along the curb. And then alongside the curb in the street, in the gutter, I should say, there are hundreds of policemen lined down as far as you can see, keeping this tremendous crowd back. As we look across the street at the Lane Bryant building, people are sitting outside the windows, on the windowsills, their feet dangling in midair from as high as two stories, and it doesn't look particularly comfortable from where we stand. And then people are really lined all along every single window. There are dozens and dozens of flags. There are six flags on almost every floor of that Lane Bryant building. And then moving down the block as we see it, there are two tremendous flags right opposite the steps of the library building. Across the street, going down past 41st toward 42nd Street, more American flags than the British flag, and again the American flag. Past 42nd, more American flags all the way down the line. It is really a true tribute to a great leader. These police, who have done a magnificent job in controlling the crowd, which is numbered by some photographers who have had tremendous experience, great experience, in the field of covering these tremendously important events. These photographers say that about 20,000 people are assembled on these two blocks from 42nd Street to 40th Street, and that really is a crowd. And we don't make any pretense to deny that. There are every kind of armed servicemen here. There are WAX and WAVES. There are Marines, both commissioned officers and non-commissioned. There are plenty of soldiers. There's a soldier standing right next to me who's going to take plenty of pictures for the Army. And then there are dozens of photographers with their press tickets proudly displayed, and plenty of hamming going on, a lot of fun. The crowd is very quiet on the hall, though, and taking it all in very calmly. We just saw our WNYC motor car drive by a big, beautiful Cadillac carrying Mr. Mike Jablons of the production department, Mr. Novick, the director of the station, who waved to us very happily as they rode by and signaled more or less that General Eisenhower and his party would be along in just a moment. As yet, we haven't seen General Eisenhower's cars. We haven't seen any other cars since that time, and it was about five minutes ago. General Eisenhower of the Army and Mayor F.H. LaGuardia will be in the first car of the procession, and then in the second car, Lieutenant General Walter Bettel-Smith and Grover Whelan will be seated. I'd imagine that they will be open cars so everyone can see them, and I'd imagine, too, that everyone will get a tremendous thrill out of seeing these men. Across the street, little human interest item here, some children couldn't be more than two and a half or three feet high, sneaked through a very tall man's legs to get to the curb, and the police promptly shoved them back right through the man's legs and made them get back in line, but it seems that that tall man was very good-natured and stepped back and let the children get in front. I see just a bit of paper coming out of the windows now, perhaps from a way up in the very tall buildings overlooking the library, perhaps they can see the procession coming down. I can't from where we're standing, which is about 10 or 15 feet in the air, above the crowd here at the corner, the northwest corner of 40th Street and 5th Avenue. But I believe that perhaps some people can see the troop moving. There's a tremendous dirigible. There's a big dirigible flying right down 5th Avenue, ladies and gentlemen. If I could see the name, I could. It's not a dirigible. I've been corrected by the Army, ladies and gentlemen. It's a blimp. It's a very, very, it's a very, very large one, though, and it's attracting the attention of the spectators. It seems that from all signals, the troop is coming right now, and we're going to... Mayor Lagardia sitting right behind him, and the second car follows General Bedell Smith and Grover Whalen. They just made it round up here. It's a tremendous crowd lining both ends of the curb. There's just a thin swathe of the 5th Avenue gutter that is open just to permit the parade going through. The whole crowd now is following downtown. We, on the vantage point at 60th Street and 5th Avenue, have to turn around to follow the parade. They're down now at 59th Street, just opposite the stately Dignified Plaza Hotel. The weather is pretty nice now. Even the Weather Bureau has chipped in to give its cooperation in making it much cooler. There's a northeasterly breeze coming in to make things rather dignified. The Eisenhower entourage has been a little late, and that's been fortunate because we've had a lot of technical difficulty in setting up this line. As a matter of fact, even as I talk to you, I don't know whether we're coming through or not, but in the hopes that we are, we want to thank the telephone people for making that connection just in time. The car has just been held up momentarily. The 25-car motorcade, consisting of closed Packard cars now, that's a rather unusual circumstance, is just about passing the tail end of this reviewing stand right now. As yet, we have not seen our mobile transmitter coming through. They should be right in the center of the procession somewhere, perhaps after the 25th car. At least we hope so. General Eisenhower must be on 58th Street now, completely surrounded by a colorful, thrilling crowd, just standing up and cheering to show General Eisenhower how glad we New Yorkers are to welcome him and have him back. Overhead now is a Navy blimp, which is just about on 58th Street. That blimp has been circling back and forth, waiting the arrival of General Dwight David Eisenhower very impatiently. It looks like a silver cigar standing up. It's turning north now and is almost overhead. There are still cars filled with Army dignitaries coming across the mouth of Central Park. We still have not reached the tail end of the 25-car motorcade. On its way down along 5th Avenue from 60th Street, where we're talking to you, it will emerge from the park and is preceded by a band of Army from the 376th Army Service Unit. We now see our WNYC mobile transmitter just about reaching the edge of the park. I imagine that from here on and 60th Street along 5th Avenue, the motorcade will proceed at a very much slower pace than it has from the airport, because the plane was very late in coming into LaGuardia Airport. Perhaps even at no faster than a march pace in order to see, for New Yorkers to see General Dwight D. Eisenhower and all these returned Army veterans and give a better welcome to the hero of the occasion. Right across us now, a group of about 50 mounted police is bringing up the tail end of this 25-car motorcade, accompanying General Dwight David Eisenhower from LaGuardia Airport through Central Park. He has made his way across the Triborough Bridge to get to this point, down along the East River Drive, cutting into Manhattan, making a salient at 125th Street. And then he consolidated his position, apparently, very rapidly, because we were quite surprised to see him come across this point as quickly as he did, even though the parade itself is approximately 25 minutes overdue. We're speaking to you, ladies and gentlemen, from the northwest corner of 40th Street and 5th Avenue, from which point we are now momentarily awaiting the arrival of the motorcade, which is bringing General Eisenhower to City Hall. Maybe there is something in the saying that the last shall be first and the first shall be last, because we happen to be in the 25th car of the motorcade, and we arrived here about five minutes ago with police escort to get us down here in time, so that we may describe for you the scene as General Eisenhower moves south with to City Hall to be officially greeted there by the city. The throng here in front of the New York Public Library is about 18 deep. People virtually have to fight their way through the crowds to move downtown or across town, and every 15 feet is a police officer. It is absolutely thick with people. Flags of the United States are flying. Flags of Great Britain are flying. And there has been absolutely no rain, and we're still being promised that there will be none. Now, of course, the General's great concern is that baseball game this afternoon, which he is so anxious to see. One motorcycle is moving down the middle of Fifth Avenue, which is absolutely deserted for vehicles with the exception of those of the police department. One other vehicle coming down with red lights on it, and we notice, too, that a blimp of the United States Navy is flying over the motorcade, thus indicating exactly what position they are in. We do know that they are in Central Park, and we are awaiting their emergence from Central Park. And, of course, here down on Fifth Avenue, these buildings, these tall buildings make canyons, and we expect that as soon as the motorcade, which is bearing the General, moves down, that we will see flags waved by the millions of people. Certainly there must be millions of people assembled here up and down Fifth Avenue. And then, of course, that roar, which will come when they finally get a good look at him. We're much closer to the General than we had been out at LaGuardia Field, and so are the people which are here. Incidentally, the United States Army Band will lead this parade to 42nd Street. And at 42nd Street, the Police Department Band of the City of New York will take over, and they will provide the music for this motorcade as it moves down to City Hall. There does seem to be some activity up around St. Patrick's Cathedral, which we can see here. There's a police car moving down very slowly. There seems to be a great number of people there that are probably pushing out onto the curb. And as a matter of fact, here we not only have the police dependent upon their good, strong arms, but barriers have been erected with big signs on the police line, Do not cross. And they are serving to keep the people back. We have not as yet noticed that any of the buildings which are along Fifth Avenue have been boarded up, which is, of course, conventional when New York celebrates. There does not seem to be the exuberance present at the moment at any rate that there have been on other receptions for noted people when New York has let its hair down and really given out with everything that it has had. However, there's no display of paper as we usually see. Perhaps downtown New York will take care of that. But then, too, a special notice, for example, was told to the people to lay off the paper since that might be an indication to the general that New York City was not cooperating in the paper drive. Oddly enough, we noticed, too, from the newspapers that they did say that the paper scrap would be picked up tomorrow. So there may be a shower of it later on. Now we understand that we can pick up our mobile truck, which is in the parade. So let's go to Dick Pack. Here we are again, ladies and gentlemen, at the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 40th Street. And still we haven't been able to pick up the truck that we were supposed to. Yes, I'm getting the nod from the control men. They're very, very happy that I got their signal. We're about 40 feet from our control men here. It's a very, very odd affair because control men generally are right next to the announcer or in a control room. But as it appears right now, the control men are on a platform which is on the barrier or behind the barrier of the Fifth Avenue Library. And then we are on a specially built platform which is out on the curb, more or less, and on the corner of the sidewalk that is in the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue and 40th Street in New York. Here's a police car coming down very, very, very slowly. And there comes the Army Band, ladies and gentlemen. I can just see it. I can just barely hear it with my sharp ears. The crowd is starting to get excited, very excited, ladies and gentlemen. They're screaming. Men are jumping on taller men's shoulders. There's a man of about 55 years old who's jumped on a man of 30 years old's shoulders. Children are jumping on their parents' shoulders as well. There comes another police car. It's coming down a little quicker. Several, several horses bearing policemen are marching up toward the parade from Fifth Avenue. Now they stop at the corner of 42nd and 5th to stop the crowd from crossing. The crowd was trying to get out into the middle of the street to see the parade. And of course, the police very capably, very ably, and very efficiently put that crowd back. The Army Band is coming down very slowly. We can see it. We can hardly hear it because now the crowd is making a little more noise than it had in the past. We're going to hold the microphone here, and we hope that we can give you the sound of the truck of the band from... In just a moment. And now here's Joe Hassel, who's going to give you the rest of the broadcast of the proceedings on Fifth Avenue. Thank you very much. The band is now moving down. And as you were told, there was that element of excitement which suddenly rang through the crowd as they finally realized that General Eisenhower was but a short distance away. The band is moving in at a parade speed of about 2 miles per hour. And the first time analysis was made that it would take them one minute to pass each block. And that, of course, means that New Yorkers will have a chance to get a really good look at General Eisenhower. The parade is now at about 45th Street. The head of the parade is now at about 45th Street. And the police car has just come down to notify all of the officers here and the men of the police department to keep the crowd back. And I can tell you one thing, that as soon as this open spot, which is here in front of the public library, as soon as the crowd gets a look at the General, you can be sure that a terrific roar will be going up. Joe, may I say just a word, please? It's been pointed out to me by our Army photographer standing alongside of us, that there's a discharged Army veteran who possibly was, probably was wounded in action, is wearing braces on his legs, and he's been helped to a little platform which is built in front of the library. He's been helped there by several men so that he can see his General Ike pass. I think that is a human interest point in itself. Well, that's right. There are a great many men in uniform that are stationed here, since many of the Army Service Force units are around here, but many of these men have come over, and many of the men are of course back in the United States on rotation here, officers too, who do want to get a look at this General who did such a terrific job in Europe. There has been no cascading of... Now there is, from one of the buildings' cascades, a flurry of paper. The buildings are dotted and lined with the employees. As you know, the City of New York has given its employees half a day off, and all of the stores along Fifth Avenue and Broadway have declared a half-holiday for their employees so that they might come out here and see General Ike. Now the parade is moving up to 42nd Street. The mounted police of the New York City Department have now approached 42nd Street. We're facing directly out of the motorcade, strings out for many, many blocks, and then we can see the crowd closing in from behind as New York goes back to its normal daily life. Here comes some more motorcycles that have gone by, paper cascading from the French building on the east side. The horses prancing around now as the music of the Army Band reaches them, and now we're waiting to see this maneuver, which will see the police department take over and escort General Ike further downtown. We would say that this parade, which is now running 16 minutes behind schedule, it was very carefully timed out, but bad weather from Washington to New York delayed the C-54 transport plane of General Ike's, and he arrived about 16 minutes late at LaGuardia Field. And of course, all times have been moved up 16 minutes. There was no effort to make up any time from LaGuardia Field to New York so that the people might get a real good look at this general. Now here is the head of the police motor, the police cavalry, and the horses are prancing all around, and as you can hear, the hubbub in the background indicates that the general is getting pretty close so that the crowd might get a look at them. And we see youngsters jumping up and down in back of people, and they're about 15 deep. Then there's the sidewalk. People are now climbing all over the shrubbery and the grass of the public library, then on the steps of the public library and other crowds. And the leading horse is just jumping all over the place as he can barely hear the music. And now I'm sure that in the background you can hear the clicks of the cameras, the newsreel machines, as they take photographs of this Cortez as it moves down upon us. This motorcade is now moving in closely, and you can hear the applause from the people as the horses prance out in the middle of Fifth Avenue. Well, if you think that the first horse is really dancing, you should see the last one. There's two of them back there that are doing every version of anything that any horse might dance to. And now even more of them. And these horses are moving very smartly, very sprightly, and it is police cavalry A. And in the background we can hear the army band, and we assume that the police department band will take over. And many, many people are now climbing up on this platform so that they might get a good look at General Ike. You can hear the clatter of the horse's hooves as it beats on Fifth Avenue. And here is the color guard of the police cavalry with the American flag and the City of New York flag. And here now comes Troop B of the city-mounted police. And the crowd is getting a great thrill out of this horse that we mentioned. In the last line, he's in the middle. He is dancing sideways. He is prancing all over the place, really having himself a good time. These horses are being held very much in check. And one who is being held very tightly is all lathered in white. Now the parade very slowly moves up. And the police department band has taken over and are now escorting General Ike Eisenhower. There is quite a gap between the police cavalry, a gap of about one gap, and then the band which is moving down. And you can hear the applause. And you can see the people waving now and cheering in the distance. And General Ike is about two blocks away from us. The head of the parade has gone by. There's a gap of one box. And then we have the police department band which is moving up. And if you feel here in the background the banging around of a microphone, that's people that are jumping up here and bouncing it around because the footing which we have is not too secure. Well, here comes the police department band, the yells, and let's see if we can pick up the music. Here's that girl for Eisenhower. You want to see him. Why, he's just as American as anything could possibly be. He's standing up in the car, waving one hand to the crowd in front of the library. Listen to them yell and cheer at him. And then he turns around and faces the other side. And he holds his hands high over his head, just as a fighter who's won a terrific fight. And he has. Then he salutes to the crowd and he waves to them. And everybody's just cheering and yelling at him. What a tremendous personality this man has. And he waves and he's got that Eisenhower grin and he salutes over here. Listen to the roar for him. Here he is, General Light, and he's just cheering, yelling and laughing. And he whistles back at the crowd. And here he comes. He salutes over. A magnetic personality as he whistles and waves to everybody. And General Light, just listen to the roar. Here he is. The General waves and yells and has a great time for himself there. And golly, he is tremendous with six rows of ribbons on his chest. The Distinguished Service Cross with two oak leaf clusters. And he faces everybody. He's laughing his head off, having a tremendous time. He has now hit 40th Street. He moves slowly down. And the crowd just loves it. And they love the way he's waving to them and saluting and shaking his hands over his head as he moves down. He holds his left hand up now as he waves to the far side of the street. And people are yelling and jumping out in front to take pictures of him. And he's waving again to the crowd as he's moving now south below 40th Street. The police, everybody's laughing. The mayor just sits there very stardly enjoying himself because Eisenhower's enjoying himself. And now the motorcade has hit down to 39th Street. And apparently the tempo has moved up just a little bit. And the crowd starts to walk downtown to see if they possibly may not have another look at him. The motorcade has slightly stepped up since it has passed here the public library. But I'm sure that it will have to take something tremendous downtown to overcome that terrific roar which went up as he passed the library. Now he is standing again with his hands high over his head, waving with his hands over his head. And again he just keeps turning in the car, waving, yelling, saluting, laughing out loud. He really is enjoying himself. And he's getting a tremendous ovation from these people here in New York. Which I believe up to now, the time, the total is from 2 to 3 million that are seeing him. The greatest people, the greatest mass of people ever in New York City to welcome anyone. Now the motorcade has moved down to 38th Street. And we return you to our studios. We're going to try to contact City Hall. And now we take you to City Hall and Tommy Cowan. Well, City Hall is certainly one of the biggest parties that ever was witnessed any time in the history of receptions here at City Hall today. And it looks as though Mayor Lagarde's entire city family of 7 and a half million people have come out to City Hall to thoroughly enjoy the festivities. The weatherman has been sort of on the fence, but he's stayed off from now without any bad symptoms. It's interesting to see so many of our official family that used to be around City Hall here in naval uniforms. I see Clendenin Ryan. Gene Tunney just created quite a stirs. He arrived with Mr. and Mrs. Tunney. Well, if I started giving you famous names, I'd do nothing but repeat names that are famous in the fields of accomplishment. Harry Hirschfield is standing there waving to friends. Well, that's the way it goes. Well, that's the way it goes. Ann Morgan is sitting here. And a great many others, of course, representatives of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and all the various services. The Army band has just arrived very wearily from its part of the festivities, and they're taking their places now. We're going to have a fine musical program immediately after the arrival of General Eisenhower and the formalities. He sits down. We'll hear Igor Gorin. We'll hear Marian Anderson, of course, singing the anthem. James Melton, Gordon Heath. And we also have the Police Glee Club furnishing the music elements as well in the brief interlude of music before the formalities and speeches begin. This huge audience will enjoy all of this here at City Hall. And then the mayor of the city of New York, in this proudest moment of his life, will present the medal of the city of New York, the honors of the city, and the best wishes. Of course, there'll be a little time for cheering. Those elements will have to be absorbed in the regular schedules. But a very, very interesting program indeed has been arranged for you. And the mayor has been very successful indeed in arranging this party. The arrangements are well-nigned, perfect. Everybody seems happy. The police and fire department have combined in keeping everybody happy and smiling. And imitating the police and fire department. Everybody is doing just exactly that. Now, Joe, how much time do you want here? Is Joe Fishley doing anything? Keep on going? Well, the police department has made almost perfect arrangements. And the army band is getting settled now. The kids have started the cheering gallery over here to one side. And, really, the skyscrapers around the City Hall area here remind you of the San Carlo Opera, some of the Metropolitan Opera House, and one of the great amphitheaters of the world. As the various storied facades of the skyscrapers represent, as we might say, boxes at a theater. And they are certainly loaded with people. The lower roofs, that undeveloped piece of property there between Park Place and Murray Street is really in a great advantage because the buildings there haven't gone so high. And the roofs there are absolutely crowded. The subway, of course, the original little subway that curls under City Hall is more or less closed off now because, I guess, you couldn't get out of it if you tried. But I wouldn't say that because if it's an exit, the police are taking care of that in a regular way so that if you're a passenger and you got a ticket, you come to the party. If you haven't got a ticket, you have to keep moving out until you can get to the vantage place somewhere in this immense crowd. It's really an amazing sight. We were testing the microphones a little while ago to make sure that the loudspeakers were working perfectly, that the dew and other atmospheres and the light rain of last night didn't damage any of the connections in any way. Because we know water can create a great deal of damage in electrical apparatus. It's all been tested out. It works fine. But as we stood up in the exact spot where General Eisenhower will stand, it's perfectly amazing, this sight. You really, I think General Eisenhower will have one of the greatest thrills of his life as he stands in this focal point here in front of City Hall and looks out on this sea of faces. And it is veritably a sea. And if he doesn't believe it's a sea, there's enough admirals, sailors, commanders, and all other members of the armed forces participating to make it seem like a real ocean voyage itself. The men, the wounded soldiers and sailors and marines that have been brought in from the various hospitals who occupy vantage points here at the mayor's reception, they certainly created a sensation when they came in and they got a heart feeling welcome from the immense crowd here. They certainly must feel happy and appreciated even though they are incapacitated by their great experience in the war emergencies. All these things go to make up a cross section of the entire world. The embassies, the consuls are all represented here at City Hall. And the mayor is certainly bearing out all his hard work of the previous few days in arranging this party. Of course, the burden of it falls primarily on the police department because it's a tremendous responsibility not only to have so many people gather in front of City Hall, but to actually seat them in comfort as you would at a theater or any other place where a great spectacle is in progress. Yet the mayor has carried this plan out very beautifully and there's no doubt about it, there's countless thousands of happy people that will tell their children and their children's children about this wonderful day in front of City Hall when the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Fiorello H LaGuardia, welcomed and brought to General Eisenhower the best wishes and acclaim of the great city over which he presides. There's no doubt about it, there's only one New York, that isn't chauvinistic, it just means that we're here, we know what it all means, and it's a wonderful privilege. Well now I don't want to take all the time, we send you back now to Nat Rudick and Master Control. Well this is Nat Rudick speaking to you from the top of the municipal building where our studios are located. From this vantage point we can see, overlook completely, City Hall Park and Plaza. It's really a thrilling sight from here since we see all the people sitting in the plaza above, well I'm not a judge, but I imagine it must be at least 30,000 to 40,000 people sitting. That doesn't take into consideration the people that are lining all the sidewalks along Broadway and stretching down into the canyon past St. Paul's Church. The sight from here as you look down to the crowd sitting in the plaza is a strange one. You see the multicolored dresses and hats that people are wearing. It looks like a pinpoint, some type of a print, almost like a patchwork quilt with all these various colors. And we hear from up here the sound of the band playing, the sound of the band playing in front of City Hall itself. Back of City Hall there is a large court building. Those of you who know City Hall Park know that the large court building immediately back of City Hall. And back of that along Chambers Street there are 23, 24 staff cars lined up. Army staff cars with the army personnel waiting alongside the cars. What they're to be used for we don't know, but there are 24 of them making a good fleet of cars. And along Broadway there are people milling about, I imagine must be 15 and 16 deep, people 15 and 16 deep from the sidewalk down to the street. And all along as at the other points along the march there are policemen who are keeping the crowds back. The traffic is still running up and down Broadway. They haven't closed the traffic from there at all. And along Broadway there are the windows incidentally in the Wilworth building and the building next to it, immediately next to it, south of it. Completely filled with people or every window is filled with at least one or two people. Some of the terraces as these buildings go higher, you know, the terraces recede as they go up. And on these terraces there are people also very, very beautifully dressed with all these colors that we can see from here. It's really a very colorful sight. The building on the corner of Chambers Street and Broadway, at the very top the terraces have around them, they've built up fences, wooden fences around these terraces. So the people that are on the terraces won't fall over, we assume that what they're there for. The, uh, all the buildings that we can see from here, at this point we are at the highest point in the park, along the park that is. Uh, all the buildings are flying flags. And right now, immediately over, uh, central, uh, City Hall Park, a plane, a four-motored plane is flying over the park. Uh, the band has stopped playing down there now. Uh, we will return you now to our, uh, studio for, uh, a roundup of news and then try to contact our truck, which is in the procession, and try to bring in a description of them as they come down 14th Street and go east. But until that time, here's some news with Fred Handrich taking it. All right, Fred, come on in, Fred Handrich. All right, here's a roundup for the latest world news. General Eisenhower's cavalcade, as you've been hearing, now is moving through the streets of New York to the cheers of the city millions. The metropolis is gay with the stars and stripes flying in a refreshing breeze. The motor parade expects to reach City Hall at about noon for the official welcome by Mayor LaGuardia. The mayor, of course, was waiting at the field, which bears his name, when Eisenhower's C-54 appeared in the gray skies. He taxied to a stop precisely at 10, 12 a.m., and New York's mayor LaGuardia rushed up as soon as he saw the famous Eisenhower grin and said, The admiration of seven and one-half million people is extended to you, General Eisenhower. The general shook hands and murmured his thanks. And then while the band played flourishes and the generals marched, the mayor escorted General Light to the official automobile, and the motorcade began its 35-mile trip. Well, the nation is saluting General Eisenhower today with the full realization that Japan remains to be beaten as thoroughly as was Germany. This sober understanding is underscored by two dispatches of bad news from the Pacific, the death of Lieutenant General Simon Buckner, Jr., and the loss of the destroyer minesweeper Emmons. The Emmons was sunk by sister ships 12 hours after five Jap suicide planes crashed into her off Okinawa. Fifty-nine men went down on the Emmons, seventy-eight were wounded in the attack, and two were missing. The Emmons was one of the ships which formed the escort for the convoy which took President Roosevelt across the Atlantic for his meeting with Stalin and Terran in November of 1943. The Emmons died fighting. She shot down six of the twelve planes which opened the attack on her. On Okinawa, American fighting men are mourning the loss of the commander of the 10th Army. General Buckner's funeral was held at a beach where the first troops went ashore on Easter morning. And today, troops lined the dusty road as the general's plain wooden casket was borne to the 7th Division Cemetery. His aide, Major General Frank Hubbard, Jr. of Des Moines, said Buckner was smiling when the jab burst came and the smile remained on his face in death. Well, here's some good news from the Pacific. The Navy Department announces that American submarines have sunk eleven more Japanese ships, including two light warships. This brings the submarine bag up to eleven hundred and fifty-three enemy ships sunk since Pearl Harbor. In Europe today, King Leopold of Belgium has announced that he has no intention of giving up his throne. A statement of Salzburg, Austria, quotes the king as saying that he is assumed as full constitutional prerogatives. Two of the king's agents are in Belgium at present, conferring with government leaders, who may step out of office as soon as the monarch sets foot on his native soil. Dispatches from Brussels declares that strikes and protests against the king's return to Belgium have spread to the coal region of Liège. The trial of the sixteen Poles has entered its second day in Moscow. The deputy premier of the London Polish regime has taken the stand and after prolonged questioning from the Soviet Union, presiding judge said that he received hostile directives from the exiled Polish regime in London. The first witnesses today was a Polish journalist who said the Polish underground considered the Red Army an enemy. In Denmark, ships are being loaded by men who have their heart in the task. The ships are to carry 600 tons of butter and 200 tons of eggs to Great Britain. That food is to be exchanged for coal that inaugurates peaceful trading in sharp contrast to the Nazis' method of just taking what they wanted, which of course was practically everything. And that's the latest world news, and this is the Municipal Broadcasting System. The city station continuing its policy of giving the greatest possible service to New York City listeners, we are bringing you complete coverage of the parade and demonstrations in honor of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. In addition to broadcasting ceremonies through the day, with eyewitness stories, at 8 this evening we will bring you in recording sections of the welcomes which our great American hero received in the capital cities of London and Paris, as well as a repeat broadcast of the most interesting portions of New York City celebration. And then at 10 p.m., due to the fact that the FCC has granted your city station extra air time in order that we might carry everything taking place on this momentous day, we will bring you the address of General Eisenhower from the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. So, for the most complete coverage of today's long-to-be-remembered ceremonies, keep tuned to New York City's own station, WNYC, WNYC-FM. Well, here we go to City Hall again. Come in, Joe Fishler. Good morning, fellow New Yorkers. This is Joe Fishler speaking to you from historic City Hall Plaza, the scene of so much brilliant pageantry and so many colorful receptions. As you know, this June 19th of the year 1945 has been designated by Mayor LaGuardia as Eisenhower Day to honor the hero of the Western European theater of war. Tommy Cowan, a little earlier this morning, I think told you something about the color that is to be seen here in City Hall Plaza this morning. A special platform has been erected in the shape of the prow of a landing craft infantry, an LCI, to commemorate the landing on the Normandy beachhead. Flanking both the east and west sides of the prow are the stands which are occupied by prominent civic and government representatives, as well as high-ranking army and Navy officials. Just south of the receiving stand, there has been set aside a reserved section for very prominent guests who are on hand to welcome and to honor General Dwight David Eisenhower here this morning in City Hall. As Mayor LaGuardia told you during his talk to the people on Sunday last at one o'clock, some 40,000 odd seats have been placed on the sward which is that of City Hall Park. City Hall Park, of course, bounded on the north by City Hall itself, on the east by Park Row, flanked by the Old World and Herald buildings, and on the west by Broadway with its historic Woolworth building. Down at the southern end of City Hall Park, of course, you may remember a few years back, the old post office building which is now located one block west down on Church Street. And down at the far end also is historic St. Paul's Church, past which the General and his party will be coming in some 15 or 20 minutes from now. I believe Tommy Cowan has described to you some of the very many interesting things that have happened since the crowd began pouring in at approximately a quarter of nine this morning. A compliment of some 300 veterans of the European Theatre came in at approximately 10.30 or 25 minutes of 11, and they were greeted with sustained applause and the cheers of the some estimated 80,000 people gathered here in the plaza, either seated or standing on Park Row and Broadway. Then Commander Gene Tunney made his appearance and he created quite a furor. All that is lacking, of course, is for Commander Jack Dempsey to make his appearance, and we could probably have a little set-to between the two branches of the service which they represent. Now, the Sanitation Department Band under the direction of John Celebray is playing over on the east side of the receiving stand, and until there through, we think we'll give you a little bit of the colorful music which has been played for us here all morning, after which we'll try and trace for you a brief description of the back history of City Hall and some of the many colorful receptions that have been given here ever since City Hall was created in 1824. Here's the Sanitation Department Band John Celebray conducting. Of course, ever since General Eisenhower's arrival at LaGuardia Airport, you've been kept abreast of his progress across the Triborough Bridge through Central Park, down Fifth Avenue and across 14th Street to the East River Drive, then down to the Battery, and very shortly north on Broadway. You've been told about the plans which have been made for his entertainment while the guest of the world's largest city, plans which include lunch with Mayor LaGuardia at the Mayor's house, his attendance at America's national pastime of baseball at the Polo Grounds with the Giants and Boston Braves, and the official dinner and reception at the Waldorf this evening. Ever since his arrival in Washington yesterday, this General of the Army, the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Expeditionary Forces and the European Theater of War, has been on the official go. Parade and reception in Washington yesterday, an address to Congress, his flight here to New York, and now all this. But New York knows how to greet its heroes, and is going all out to make General Eisenhower's stay in this metropolis a warm, though probably a tiring one. And now the Second Service's Army Command Band, stationed at Fort J, is playing here on the west side of the plaza. So let's listen to some of this colorful music. For 번 was it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. at the plaza. They have closed off the traffic now in a long broad way, leading down into the canyon, the Heroes Canyon, as we've gotten to call it, after so many heroes marched up it, through the ticket tape, etc. What I can see from here is this. Along Park Row, there's one last car that's finally moving through. Now the gap has been taken up by people coming through the side streets, all along the side streets. It's all jammed up. All of Park Row is jammed up. There are a great number of trucks and buses jammed up in there too. They've been stopped. There are trucks, a few cabs. They've been stopped. They can't get into Broadway. That's all been closed off now. Down by St. Paul's Church, just two blocks down from the Woolworth Building, there are two bulges of people out on Broadway. In other words, the police haven't been able to keep the crowd under control, haven't been able to keep them back along the sidewalk. What's happened down there probably is people coming up VZ Street have just emptied out onto Broadway and have filled Broadway. There are two or three police cars down there trying to get the people back up to the sidewalk because there's just enough room for one car to go through at that point. I don't think the police want that kind of a condition to exist nor remain. They're really trying to get those people back without any luck. Now the people are coming up from Broadway, coming down from Broadway. All people, great throngs of them are coming down Broadway, filling in Chamber Street now so that no one can possibly get through to walk up Broadway from Chamber Street up. It's all closed off now in there. The whole park now is completely studded with people. The place is completely packed with people, sitting on the chairs that you know are there, the 40,000 seats. That's all filled and the people are jamming all the streets along the sides. Those people who are standing along the sides will later on be able to hear the general speak when the mayor presents them with the medal of the city of New York because we have our loudspeaker system, the municipal broadcasting loudspeaker system, all set so that everyone can hear from all, no matter where they stand along the park, all around the triangle of the park. Now the roofs of all the buildings are beginning to fill in with the multicolored costumes. The people are starting to come out of their offices and fill in the roofs and all the windows. Down on Park Row, we can see two ambulances. That is, there are two Red Cross wagons there, probably to take care of anyone that, well, any trouble that they have to take care of. There's nothing else to describe from up here. As I told you, the place now is literally jam-packed with people. Uh, no cars can go through, uh, uh, up Broadway, down Broadway, cannot possibly come down Broadway because the police have formed the cordon with 15, oh, 15, 20 deep, people 15, 20 deep, uh, all along the, I hear, uh, fire engines. I don't know what that means. I think what we'll do is send it back to City Hall and Joe Fishler. How about City Hall? Send it back to Joe Fishler. Fishler, come on in. There's Joe Fishler at City Hall once again, ladies and gentlemen. I think that on this occasion, it might be interesting to trace the history of New York City Hall. The first building was the Stadthuis at number 73 Pearl Street, a stone building erected in 1642 at the expense of the West India Company and first used as a warehouse and tavern. In 1653, when the Berger government was established, the tavern was converted into the City Hall. That was the first building. The second building, begun in 1699 and completed in 1703, stood on the northeast corner of Nassau and Wall Street and occupied the site of what is now the sub-treasury building. It was not only the seat of municipal government, but also of the provisional government or the provincial government, rather, when the state legislature met in New York and also of the federal government during the first few years after the inauguration of Washington as first president of the United States, Washington having been inaugurated in that second building. The cornerstone of the third and present City Hall was laid by Mayor Edward Livingston on May 26, 1803, when City Hall Park was on the outskirts of the city. It was formally dedicated on May 5, 1812, although the Common Council met there as early as August 12 of the previous year. Of course, you've all noticed that the style is that of the Italian Renaissance, but you may not know the dimensions of the building, 216 feet wide, 105 feet deep. The south, east, and west sides are of Stockbridge marble, while the north side is of brownstone. Among its historic chambers is the Governor's Room, so-called because of its collection of portraits of governors and other distinguished citizens. In this room may also be seen the chair in which Washington was inaugurated first president of the United States, the desk on which he penned his first message to Congress, several of the chairs used by the first Congress and brought from the second City Hall, a portrait of Washington woven in silk, a bust of Henry Clay, the battle flags of the first New York Regiment, and a part of Peter Stavison's famous pear tree. Among the historic associations of City Hall Park was the reading of the Declaration of Independence to the American Army here assembled on July 9, 1776, an event commemorated by a tablet on the south front of the building, just a few feet away from where I'm standing now. President Lincoln's body lay here in state in 1865 after his assassination. On August 16, 1824, when William Paulding was mayor, Lafayette was received here after a brilliant reception at the Battery and some ceremonies at Castle Garden, which most of us knew as the Aquarium, and which of course no longer exists, having been torn down for the approaches to the Brooklyn tunnel. In August of 1858, the laying of the Atlantic Cable was celebrated by an illumination of City Hall, from which the building caught on fire. The front was blackened with smoke, and the windows remained boarded up for a long time. In 1860, Albert Edward, then Prince of Wales, was received here. In more recent years, Edward Prince of Wales, the King and Queen of the Belgians, Marshal Geoff, General John J Pershing, who was visited yesterday in Washington by General Eisenhower, Charles A. Lindbergh, Marie of Romania, and many other notables have been received in this most historic spot on Manhattan Island. Tommy Cowan did, I believe, at about 17 minutes past 11 o'clock, bring you a description of the many colorful receptions which he himself has either broadcast or witnessed here at City Hall since he became connected with the municipal broadcasting system stations. Now, we've just been informed that the general and his party are down near the battery, which means that they should be up here in City Hall Plaza in approximately 10 minutes. As you know, the general of the army, Dwight David Eisenhower, has been traveling from Europe to Washington, from Washington to New York, with a party of 53 officers and men, one of these being a private first class. Many of these officers and men are natives of some of our central western states, particularly Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri. Some of the top ranking officers having their headquarters in Washington. Dwight David Eisenhower, a typical American, an American of originally German ancestry whose name was spelled somewhat differently from what it is today. Yet today, a member, a descendant of a pioneer American family, a family which is rich in tradition, which has always feared and trusted God, loved its country, and upheld its flag. That is the man we're honoring here today along the route of March or of the motorcade and, of course, here in City Hall Plaza. Now, at 12 o'clock noon, we are supposed to join with several independent stations to bring you the actual reception ceremonies here in the plaza, when Mayor Lagarde will present General Eisenhower with a special gold medal struck in his honor, the Medal of the City, inscribed by President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University, and which has been worked out by Tiffany's. And the general will, at the same time, be made an honorary citizen of this, the greatest city in the world. Now, we've just received the information that the motorcade bearing General Eisenhower and the entire members of his party, all the members of his party, as well as the receiving committee, has just passed Manhattan Bridge. The next bridge, of course, being the Brooklyn Bridge, which is just opposite from where we're standing now. They're traveling down the East River Drive, which finally gets into South Street, down South Street, around the Battery, and up Broadway, which has seen so very many colorful parades in the past and for many years past. Now, you can probably hear in the background the boat whistles, which I imagine are blowing as the general is passing down the East River Drive. Now, until such time as they've rounded South Ferry and they've entered Broadway to travel north past Trinity, Wall Street, the Financial District, and St. Paul's past the Woolworth Building, and then to the north end of City Hall itself in the plaza, we're returning you to our studios and Nat Rudig. Well, this is Nat Rudig speaking to you again. Thank you, Joe Fishler. We're up at the, as I told you before, at the top of the municipal building, and from here, as I said before, we can see all the way down into the canyon, down past St. Paul's Church. We will return it to Joe Fishler from City Hall so that he may give you a description as it comes up past St. Paul's, and it passes as the procession passes the Woolworth Building. We've been informed that the motorcade has gone down the East River Drive, is now approaching South Ferry. It should be there within a matter of seconds. From up here, we've seen a number of preparations being made back of City Hall. Immediately back of City Hall, there are approximately, that is, in the park, cars parked within the park, approximately 15 of them. We've been given to understand that the General's cars will not come through the plaza. As a matter of fact, they can't come through the plaza because there are seats completely in front of the City Hall and taking up the whole plaza. The cars that the General and his party are coming in will come around through the back on Chambers Street, come up a slight ramp that has been built. The cars will go into the park, back of City Hall plaza, and the General will retire to the Mayor's office in City Hall plaza, in City Hall. And from there, he will be escorted out to the platform in front of City Hall for the ovation of the crowd. At 12 noon, many of the boats in the harbor did sound their horns, their horns making a bit of a clatter down in the lower part of the river. Now, I hear, coming all the way up here, the sounds of the crowd. Evidently, the cars, here's the first motorcycle coming up Broadway, passing St. Paul's. We can hear the crowd all the way up here, hear the other motorcycles. Now, if Joe Fishler is ready, I'd like to have him describe those things coming up. Well, Joe isn't ready. He can't see any of this, and I can. There are motorcycles, there are all 15, 20, 25 motorcycles coming up Broadway. Anyway, this might have been a false alarm. The crowds are now pushing out into Broadway. They're being held back by the policemen. They're having a difficult time of it, holding the crowd back. There are a number of white-uniformed shore patrolmen that I can see from here. They're assisting the policemen down at that point. This is immediately above St. Paul's. That is in the block between St. Paul's and the Woolworth Building, where the greatest mob is, that is, out into the street. Now, here there's another wave of applause coming up from the mob down in the plaza. No, it was. It seemed to have been a false alarm. They haven't come up the canyon yet, the famous Heroes Canyon. Someone must be talking down in the City Hall Plaza over the PA system. We can hear the voice, but we can't distinguish who it is, nor can we tell you who it is, since we can't see the platform in front of City Hall. The crowd has quieted down. Someone is singing at City Hall. Let's see whether we can bring in City Hall. Is it possible to bring in City Hall? Joe Fishler at City Hall now? Someone is singing. God bless America. All right, Joe Fishler, would you come in and tell us who's singing down there, and then send it back up to me here so I can describe them as they come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. Come up. City Hall Park, once again, ladies and gentlemen, and although the ceremonies have not begun, Lucy Monroe is already in the prow of the LCI, or the simulated LCI, and is singing God Bless America, as we can hear down at the far end of City Hall Park, the bands which precede the motorcade of General Eisenhower, his party, and the reception committee. But let's listen to Lucy Monroe and some 80,000 people gathered here in City Hall Park, singing God Bless America as a greeting to General Eisenhower as he makes his way past Old St. Paul's. We're alive. Hello. I can see it from up here as Lucy Monroe is singing down there. There's a tremendous crowd of noise of the crowd. There are 100 motorcycles coming up. Now Eisenhower's car has passed St. Paul's. The crowd is going wild. There's all this noise that we can hear up here. We can see the ticket tape coming down. We can see all this paper floating in the air coming down, bedecking the cars as it comes up. I'm going to return it to Joe Fishler now and Lucy Monroe singing God Bless America. Come in, Joe Fishler. They can't come in. Well, I guess you can't hear anything from down there. All you can hear is sound. There, I can see the general standing up in his car, waving both arms, standing up in his car, waving both arms, waving his arms, and everybody along all sides of the street. Here's Joe Fishler. Come in, Joe. He's just passed the west end of City Hall Plaza on Broadway, making his way to the north side of City Hall, from which point he'll make his entrance accompanied by Mayor LaGuardia, his entire staff, the 53 members of his party who have accompanied him, who've flown over from Europe, who were received yesterday in Washington, and the official reception will be made in just a few moments. But now, ladies and gentlemen, Igor Gordon to sing the song of the United Nations. The sun and the stars all are ringing With sun rising strong from the air The hope of humanity singing A hymn to a new world and birth The united nations on the march With flux and power Together fight for victory A new free world Together fight for victory A new free world Thunderous singing Cause we're not built On our neo-israelis With the light With pub Our своих THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END and onto the simulated trowel of the landing craft infantry commemorating the Normandy Beachhead. General Dwight David Eisenhower, General of the Army, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Expeditionary Forces in the European Theater of War, back home to receive the acclaim which is the just award and the just reward to all brave men, to all heroes. General Eisenhower, however, himself has said that he is but the symbol of the many millions of GIs who've plodded through mud and snow and rain and sun and heat and cold, who've really won the victory in the European Theater, and who today in the Pacific Theater, under the command of General MacArthur, are now winning their fight against the other enemy, the brutal Japanese. We must remember that while we are saluting today, General Eisenhower, the 53 members of his party, officers and men including one private first class, we must keep up our purchases of war bonds, we must keep giving blood and blood plasma for the men who are still fighting in the far Pacific. Their need is great, and it is only with our help that they can win this other half of the great fight. Mrs. Eisenhower, flanked by women members of the city police department, making her way down in front of the speaker's stand. You know, New Yorkers are openly warm-hearted, but there are stubborn people, seven and a half million very stubborn people. For days now, they've been asked not to shower the streets with paper, with ticker tape, or particularly with the new telephone books, which were just issued a few days ago by the telephone company. And there's a rather vivid warning issued by the telephone company. If you've torn that phone book up in order to throw the paper out from the windows, you will simply have to do without a phone book until the next issue is sent out to subscribers. And as the sanitation department band, under the direction of John Salabry, plays over on the east side of the speaker's stand, the members of Eisenhower's party, his aide-de-camp, are making their way out, taking their places in the official greeting stands. And in just a moment or two, we shall welcome, and you will undoubtedly hear the tremendous welcome which will be given to General Icke, the smiling iron striker, as he makes his way out, accompanied by Mayor LaGuardia and Grover Whalen, high-ranking Army and Navy personnel, and representatives of government and civic organizations. We've been here since approximately 10.25 this morning, although networks and independent station engineers had their equipment set up since about 6.15 this morning. And I understand from those early arrivals that there were some even earlier arrivals here in City Hall Park. There were some 42,000 seats placed on the sward here in the park, flanked by Old Park Row, Broadway, and Old St. Paul's down at the southern end. 40,000 general admission seats and 2,000 reserved seats. They've all been fully occupied, of course, as they were warned to occupy them before 11 o'clock. Otherwise, those seats could not be held for any special reservations. Park Row and Broadway are jammed solid with probably an equal, if not greater, number of people than is the park itself. So that we have roughly estimated, in our not-too-knowledgeable way, that there must be some 80,000 to 90,000 people gathered here to welcome the returning conqueror, general of the army, Dwight David Eisenhower. We're still awaiting the arrival of General Eisenhower and Mayor LaGuardia, who are still in the mayor's office. It is very easily understandable, of course, that General Eisenhower should be feeling the weight of the trip that he began yesterday in Washington and which he will complete in a couple of days when he returns home and to his mother in Abilene, Kansas. Yesterday, he and his party paraded to Congress along an eight-mile route after their arrival at the airport. General Eisenhower spoke briefly to the joint session of Congress and told them then that the GI himself felt that there was a way of bringing the Germans around to our way of thinking and that we would very definitely have to do it, and soon. After the reception by the joint session of Congress yesterday in Washington, General Eisenhower and his party, his official party, rested up briefly, left Washington early this morning, and although slightly delayed by rather bad flying weather, arrived at the LaGuardia Municipal Airport shortly after 10-10. That arrival was, of course, described to you by Joe Hassel, now a member of Uncle Sam's Army, formerly a member of the announcing staff of several of the stations here in New York City. We've heard him announcing baseball and football, and we have been very happy indeed to have received permission, or for Joe Hassel to have received permission, to be with us on this Vistarok occasion. Ladies and gentlemen, here is the roar from the crowd as everybody is standing, and here is the bugle call announcing the arrival of General Eisenhower, a bugle call which was slightly premature by the Army Band stationed at Fort Jay. Now we're still awaiting the actual bugle call and the ruffles, which will greet General Eisenhower on his arrival to take his place on the speaker's stand, which, as we mentioned before, was built to simulate the prow of an LCI, a landing craft infantry commemorating the Normandy Beachhead. The roar from the crowd is still going on, but the official bugle call and ruffles for General Eisenhower have not been announced, and until they have been announced, the General, of course, will not make his official appearance, that being part of the protocol, not only of the diplomatic corps, but also of high-ranking Army and Navy officials. Robert Whalen is on stage with the commanding officers of the Second Service Command, Major General Terry, Admiral Leahy, Lieutenant General Terry, Lieutenant Colonel, or Colonel, I should say, Arthur V. McDermott, the Director of Selective Service for New York City. The Army Band stationed at Fort Jay is just waiting for the signal now for the bugle call and ruffles for General Eisenhower. I think the reason for the delay is that they're waiting for the sanitation band under the direction of John Salabri to stop playing the piece. And now here is the bugle call announcing the arrival of General Dwight David Eisenhower, the Iron Striker, General of the Army, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Expeditionary Forces. Here is the bugle calls. Thank you. Eighty thousand people to greet Dwight David Eisenhower, and here is Mayor LaGuardia. It will be sung by Miss Marion Anderson. Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed of the twilight's last gleaming whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous flight o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming and the rocket's red glare the bombs bursting in air keep proof through the night though the flag was still there O'er the ramparts we watched by the dawn's early light o'er the ramparts we watched o'er the ramparts we watched find a home of the bread come back and catch up here now Mayor LaGuardia has just announced James Melton. Off we go into the wilder yonder, climbing high into the sun. Here they come, zooming to meet our thunder, Adam, boys, give her the gun. Down we dive, spouting our flame from under, off with one hell of a roar. We live in fame or go down in flame, nothing can stop the army echo. He airs a toast to the host of those who love the vastness of the sky. To a friend we send a message of his brother, men who fly. We drink to those who give their all of old. We down we roar to score the rainbow's pot of gold. A toast to the host of men we boast, the army echo. Off we go into the wild sky yonder, keep the wings level and true. If you'd live to be a gray-haired wonder, keep the nose out of the blue. Flying men guarding the nation's border, we'll be there followed by more. In echelon we carry on, nothing can stop the army echo. Nothing can stop the army echo. Air Corps. James Melton has just sung the song of the Army Air Corps. And now over on this side of the veranda overlooking City Hall Plaza is Boyd Heath to sing Roger Young. Oh, they've got no time for glory in the infantry. Oh, they've got no use for praise as loud they sound. But in every soldier's heart in all the infantry Shines the name, shines the name of Roger Young. Shines the name, Roger Young. Fought in flight for the men he marched among. To the everlasting glory of the infantry Live the story of private Roger Young. Fought in ambush lay a company of riflemen Just grenades against machine guns in the gloom. Fought in ambush till this one of twenty riflemen Volunteered, volunteered to meet his soul. Volunteered Roger Young. Fought and died for the men he marched among. In the everlasting annals of the infantry Was the last need of private Roger Young. It was he who drew the fire of the enemy That a company of men might live to fight. And before the deadly fire of the enemy Stood the man, stood the man we hailed tonight. Stood the man, Roger Young. Fought and died for the men he marched among. Like the everlasting courage of the infantry Was the courage of private Roger Young. No, they've got no time for glory in the infantry No, they've got no use for praises loudly sung But in every soldier's heart in all the infantry Shines the name, shines the name of Roger Young Shines the name, Roger Young Wanted and died for the men he marched among. And the everlasting honor of the infantry Lives the last need of private Roger Young. And now, ladies and gentlemen, I believe it's the turn Of the police department, Glee Club, To bring us their portion of the opening ceremonies. Mr. Jones, no private rooms or telephone You'll have your breakfast in there before But you won't have it there anymore This is yummy Mr. Green We like the barracks nice and clean You'll have a house safe to clean your floor But she won't help you out anymore Do what the builders command They're in the army and not in the band This is the army Mr. Brown This is the army Mr. Brown You and your baby went to town You and your little baby She had you worried But this is war And she won't worry you anymore This is the army Mr. Jones No private rooms or telephone You had your breakfast in bed before But you won't have it there anymore This is the army Mr. Green We like the barracks nice and clean You'll have a house safe to clean your floor But she won't help you out anymore Do what the builders command They're in the army and not in the band This is the army Mr. Brown This is the army Mr. Brown You and your baby went to town You and your little baby She had you worried But this is war And she won't worry you anymore And now ladies and gentlemen Mayor LaGuardia To greet General Eisenhower officially Mayor LaGuardia General Dwight E.

Eisenhower An honorary citizen Of the city Of New York To history You will be known As a military genius In the records Of our government As general Of the army To Mamie You will be known As Dwight But to seven and a half Million people You are now Our ight Mayor LaGuardia Is now conferring Upon General Eisenhower Citizenship Honorary citizenship Of the city Of New York And the gold medal Of the city With the inscription Prepared by Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler Dr. Eisenhower Now coming up To the stand As he receives This tremendous ovation After which He will acknowledge The honors Which have just Been conferred upon him Listen to this Uproarious ovation Given to General Ike Mr. Mayor And New Yorkers As my first act As a citizen Of the city Of New York I want to issue To the mayor A word of warning New York Simply can't do this To a Kansas Farmer boy And keep its reputation For sophistication No man Could possibly Feel a higher Sense of distinction Than I do this morning Not only In the official honors That have been Heaped upon me So generously And the extravagant Commendation Paid me By your mayor But it is given To few men To see A great city Rejoicing My trip That the mayor Says is merely Beginning Has been to me An experience Of a lifetime As we started The trip This morning I kept wondering What it was That seemed To be different And then I remembered Only yesterday For the first time In three years I have ridden Through a city In which there are Not great Ragged holes Piles of rubble Destruction Naturally You are fortunate To have escaped The catastrophes That have been visited On nearly every capital Of Europe But This thing Also came back To me I know New York's Record In this war I know Its record Of 750,000 Men in the service And its record Of shipments Through its great ports Its accomplishments In other directions You did not Have that incentive Of imminent And constant danger And therefore I think possibly There is another kind Of courage That has its place In war Other than that We find On the battlefield It is the courage To continue Your job For an ideal Almost an academic Concept That New York did I do not mean To say You were not Close to the battle Line Through These 750,000 Men You sent there But the screaming Hurtling bomb Was not coming down Upon your heads The flak guns Were not firing All over the city And keeping the heavens Red with their flames It is harder To do your duty Under those circumstances From the bottom of my heart And on behalf of three million fighting men I would like to thank this city This instance For its great three years record There is another thing Mr. Mayor That impressed me Very much As you and I Rode down through The cheering throng This morning First The reason For the cheering It was not because One individual One American Came back from war It is rejoicing That a nasty job Is done One nasty job Is finished The Nazi Has been placed Where he won't harm us For a little while Anyway How much better Would it have been Had there been no cause For rejoicing Had there been no war At one stretch In our trip this morning The mayor told me There were 450,000 school children I looked at them carefully I suppose They averaged 12 years old Can the parents And the relatives Of those children Look 10 years ahead And Be satisfied With anything Less than your best To keep them away From the horrors Of the battlefield It's got to be done It isn't enough That we devise Every kind Of international machinery To keep the peace We must also Be strong ourselves Weakness Weakness Can not cooperate With anything Only strength Can cooperate If we are going To live the years Of peace To which this weary world Is entitled And which we passionately Want for our children Then We must be strong And we must be ready To cooperate And in the spirit Of true tolerance And forbearance And now Just one word A bit more personal I refer again To the Mayor's Extravagant commendation On my leadership Of a great force In Europe I had The most devoted And the ablest Band Of officers Allied And American That any officer Could have had It would have been Difficult To go wrong With me this morning Are some of those officers My naval commander My chief of staff My operations officer To them And through them And with all of the other ranks With me There are 50 in the party We will spread the news Of New York's welcome To a few returning soldiers Particularly Will we take that back To the army still in Europe Where they will gain New assurance That you are in Their anxious Your anxious thoughts And that you have not Forgotten them In your prayers And in your affections Mr. Mayor And fellow citizens I thank you all Once more For an honor They could not be excelled Anywhere In this world Or in one lifetime Thank you And as General Eisenhower Steps back From the speaker's stand Some 80 or 90,000 people Rise to their feet Applaud and clap The Sanitation Department band Now plays deep In the heart of Texas As you know General Eisenhower Was born in Tyler Was born in Tyler, Texas Although at the age Of two or two and a half His family removed To Abilene, Kansas Where he now Makes his home And where he will visit In a couple of days His mother Living there At the moment And as the band Under the direction of John Celebrate continues playing Deep in the heart of Texas General Eisenhower And his staff Mayor Lagardia And the official reception committee Are making their way Into City Hall The general The mayor And the official staff And reception committee Will then board their cars And ride back uptown The route of the uptown Motorcade Will be given to you From your studios In just a moment or two And they will finally wind up At the mayor's home For an intimate luncheon And there's the Roar which rises here again In City Hall Plaza As General Eisenhower Has made his way out Through the rear of City Hall To the west of the plaza And he is probably Caught sight of As he turned the corner At the south side I don't think that any Finer tribute Could have been paid To any man To General of the Army Dwight David Eisenhower Than the few words Spoken by Mayor Lagardia There were no battles For headlines In Eisenhower's tactics And so ladies and gentlemen From City Hall Plaza On this historic June 19th 1945 Where we've seen Honorary citizenship And a
