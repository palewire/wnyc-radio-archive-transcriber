And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Bore, accompanist, in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their kids and their kids, down a lot on the door. I want to live with God. I want to live with God. But I want to live with God. I want to live with God. What for, what for? I got a lot on the road that's the way to be. They can steal the drugs from the floor that's okay to speak. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are on me. Oh, I got plenty of love here and nothing's ready for me. I got my gal, got my song ahead and the whole day long. Do you complain? Got my gal, got my gal, got my love, got my song. I got plenty of love here and nothing's ready for me.

And nothing's plenty for me. I got my gals, got my dogs for heaven all day long. Now you complain it! Got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing I've Got Plenty of Nothing from Gershwin's Forgy and Bess. The choristers are under the direction of Florence Martirosian, with Isabelle Laboree as piano accompanist. The choristers are Eastern, where they have to make science, the choristers are strong and extensive, as actually youhet, with Gershwin's Force. The literature has been described as the IV side. The history of greatு is not one of which videos are expressed. As theuffin knives are still found, even though we don't sit down as the Lord game, the positons are gospel left. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
