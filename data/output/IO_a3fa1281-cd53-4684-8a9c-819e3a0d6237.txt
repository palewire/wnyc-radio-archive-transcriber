The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear her Oh, it breaks my heart to go. Something tells me I am near at the front to fight the foe. Oh, give us soldier boys on marching, and I can no longer stay. Oh, I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, follow this, it won't be long. We're on our way, hip hip hooray. We're going downtown, to the air. We're on our way, hip hop. We're on our way, hip hop. Handsome snakes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Handsome snakes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I thunder. Wondering, darling, if you're true. Distance only lands and shone's land. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near you. Be near your heart. Be near your heart. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother, just because there is no other. She'll be happy till she'll be happy till she'll be happy. When the harvest days are over. Yes, we do. Christ, we do. When the sun gets flowers, No, he dies so free. He dies so free. You will keep the word you said. That's the time we do shall wear. When the harvest days are over. Jesse, dear. My Jesse. The day he would come with a strong head and a dog. And the land stayed on. He's life off the floor with a trail he adored. As the land stayed on. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded. The poor girl would shake me along. He carries a trail with a tall bearing crown. And the past day long. The dawn's early on. Sweet Adeline. Sweet Adeline. My Adeline. My Adeline. At night, dear heart. At night, dear heart.
