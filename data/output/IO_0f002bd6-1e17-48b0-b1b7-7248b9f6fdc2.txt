The End Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The coast is plenty of plenty, down a lot on the door. Great somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? I've got no luck on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the sky, are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my tongue, ahead and a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gals, got my lor, got my tongue. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no sun, got no moon, and the people see. The coast with plenty of plenty, got to pray all the day. Keeps the plenty, don't worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of life. Never want me long as I'm well. Never want me strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell, are you glad I'm the Lord? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my tongue, ahead and a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gals, got my gals, got my lor, got my lor. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Beth.
