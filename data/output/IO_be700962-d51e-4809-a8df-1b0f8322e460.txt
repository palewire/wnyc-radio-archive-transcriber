With all the pageantry that this great city can muster, the fifth anniversary of the formation of the United Nations is being honored here today in its commemoration at City Hall in the presence of Mayor Vincent Impeletere and a distinguished company of commissioners, the City Council, and the Board of Estimates. This program is indeed an inspiring one. It's regrettable that television is not covering this that I can see anywhere here in the plaza. But all the way down Broadway, as far as the hour can reach past St. Paul's Chapel, practically to Fulton Street, we can see nothing but color, flags, and various colored uniforms and outfits of those who have turned out today to make this one of the most spectacular commemorations of its kind. And why not? It's the wish nearest and dearest to the heart of everyone to live peacefully with everybody else, granting them the full right to their own personality, their own idea of things, as long as that idea is a cooperative one and one that has the same aspiration, peace and humanity and love of your fellow beings. And if there's any doubt indeed that the United Nations is an aspiration on the lips and in the heart of everybody, it is being demonstrated here in New York today. It's truly a very beautiful spectacle as we watch it here from the steps of City Hall. And they say it's regrettable that television is not covering this to bring the picture to you for fear that you might think I was enthusiastic or that I exaggerated. Mayor Impeletari has been here now for quite some time and he is watching the review. Mayor Impeletari did not interrupt the masterwork hour until such time as it was absolutely necessary to bring the pageant here at City Hall. Mayor Impeletari was a great event here at City Hall and the sound of the horse's hoofs at Broadway was the signal that another great civic spectacle was underway. Mayor Impeletari has just taken her place in the stand. Mayor Impeletari has just taken her place in the stand and to give you some idea of the cross section of our city, for one who can look back over a very interesting period of its history, a very charming lady, a elderly lady I might say, has just been escorted down the steps with the aid of her woman friend and one of our handsome young policemen. And who is that lady? Mariah Savage, or Maria Savage, one of the oldest members of the Metropolitan Opera Association, who came here when Mr. Gatti Cazazza took over the office. Mariah Savage, who came here in the opera and she's here in the stand and indeed on that great stage there she's seen the spectacle of all nations in the presentation of operatic sequences at 39th Street and Broadway. That in a way has been a United Nations and we hope someday to bring into the entire world scene the harmony and beauty that music expresses so beautifully. And it's quite a harmonious contribution to the scene that this lady, Maria Savage, is here on the stand as a guest to the mayor today. No doubt you can pick up the bands in the background. Everybody's striving for space now here in front of City Hall. And I doubt very much if this entire parade is going to fit into the square. It's a way, way down Broadway yet. There's a very busy schedule for Uptown 2 at the site of the United Nations. And I'm wondering just what's going to happen to our schedule if we take all of this parade and wait for it to take its place here in the plaza. A very colorful unit turning in from Broadway now is the Chinese unit. And we can look for some very interesting doings when that gets into City Hall plaza here. We're all familiar with their beautiful oriental costumes that they wear in parades of civic importance on Fifth Avenue. And all of us now know the dragon dance and all the other factors that enter into Chinese tradition and culture. As a matter of fact, when we watch a parade on Fifth Avenue, which is more detailed than they usually are here at City Hall, we get a complete cross-section of this magnificent city. And we're aware of the fact that indeed in nationalities of all kinds, New York City has a great, greater population of nationals than the important cities of the homelands as well. That is one of the inspiring things about New York, that we have the advantage of all these colors and cultures in making up our city. It's true, it is not monotonously uniform. It's very, we might say, staggered roof peaks and skyscrapers in low buildings and high buildings. To say nothing of the underground activities of our city makes it the interesting city it is, instead of just merely a very pleasant photograph. Well, it's a wonderful city. And as we said up at the Public Works Congress here a short time ago, there was a committee of engineers there in the 9th Regiment Armory on 14th Street. And Commissioner Mr. Mullen of the Department of Public Works was the host naturally under the circumstances. And no city in the world has been compelled to meet the engineering projects and solve the engineering problems that this great and wonder city has. Those are the things we mean that makes New York so wonderful. It's the mecca for anyone who wants to do anything and express themselves in a unique way. It has picked up its impeccable situation as an art center. That was demonstrated in our art week last week when the various facets of our art colony were thoroughly demonstrated in the series of broadcasts from the galleries and other spots of interest above all our great and wonderful museums. The art week last week brought to our attention the great opportunity and the expressions in art that now makes New York practically the art center of the world. Fashion has been clearly demonstrated here right in this very building. One of the handsomest fashion shows that was ever demonstrated with an environment that could not be equal anywhere in the world. When the city hall looked more like a beautiful private residence when the charming ladies who modeled the gowns marched through the various marbled halls of this building with its crystal chandeliers, its beautiful portraits, and the carpets that had been especially prepared to preserve the beautiful gowns of the ladies. This Chinese delegation carries the most interesting embroidered and painted banners. They're perfectly beautiful to look at. Police commissioner Murphy has taken his place on the stand. It seems the whole world is down here at city hall. There's a beautiful Chinese float coming in now. It's in the shape of a cake, but certainly that isn't the cake they intend to cut here at city hall. It's got five blue candles on it. It's five tiers. That is, that's a beautiful, and here comes the traditional dragon right behind the birthday. It's a beautiful, and here comes the birthday cake. Well, when the United Nations has done its work, we won't be afraid of dragons. We won't be afraid of anything, because fear will vanish except the fear, the anxiety that we go in the matter of consideration of the good and welfare of others. But actual fear itself, in its more limited implications, I might say its subtler implications, we hope will someday vanish from the scene. Communications, this very thing called radio, and television of course, which doesn't have as yet the official coverage of radio, yet radio has brought us all together. So much so we move in the flick of a second from one spot of the world to another. And isolationism of any kind is a thing of the past. With television carrying the picture for us, all these various cultures will be united, and we'll have a complete and better understanding of all people. The floats are going up Broadway, they're not passing into City Hall Plaza, because it is absolutely jammed. Now hold this up, maybe you can hear the drumming for the dragon dance over there in the square. The dragon is doing a dance right in front of the birthday cake of the United Nations. Can you hear it? Now there's two dragons here. I don't know enough about anthropology to know whether one is a lady or one is a man. But there's a chance for a beautiful love affair if there's any idea of the decorations on these dragons. In fact, one of them is so decorated, I think it must be a lady dragon. Now it can't be a lady because it's wearing a beard. And Barnum was the only one that saw any beauty in a bearded lady. The bands are still coming in from Broadway. The floats of necessity must go up Broadway because there is absolutely not an inch of room it seems here in City Hall Plaza. And yet the bands are coming in and squeezing over and pushing over. I wish we could get a better look at those floats. They're perfectly beautiful. We get a long distance view here from the steps of City Hall as they pass on up Broadway. This was indeed a very beautiful demonstration here today. Chinatown, whatever they argue about its housing problem and whether it should be an oriental atmosphere or what it may be. If the beautiful banners here, the costumes, the dragons and all can give any inspiration to any planning group, why they'll make one of the most colorful housing projects anywhere in the world if they follow the tradition of the ancient oriental art of China. Because these banners against the green trees and the green grass, decked with flowers as they are, although the color and beauty of them themselves was not enough, is really a beautiful spot. It almost makes City Hall look as though it was blooming. The dragon seems to be preaching a little sermon and not doing very much dancing the way he's wagging his head. Chinese embroideries, of course, need no explanation to those who have any idea of their oriental beauty. And these Chinese banners from the Chinese delegation is certainly most beautiful in its effects on the general scene. There's about 15 of them here. And aside from the satin backgrounds and the various colors of those satins and the embroidery and spangles placed upon them, they're all decked with flowers along the top. They carry huge bouquets of flowers and they look really very, very beautiful. It's interesting to watch the deploying here, trying to get some sort of dress in City Hall Plaza and move over in order that other members of the parade may come in and get some vantage point. The cameras, of course, are here and they'll have plenty to photograph here today. The vans are still going up Broadway and we're getting nowhere near our speaking program, which is a very interesting one. The mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Vincent Impelle Terry, the chairman of the mayor's reception committee, Mr. Whelan, and the distinguished members of our board of estimate and apportionment, members of the city council and other distinguished citizens who have turned out today in the civic acknowledgement of the fifth birthday of the United Nations, is certainly being treated to a most colorful spectacle, crowded every inch of space with color and beauty. The freedom bell that's to ring out in Berlin today had its debut here in front of City Hall a few weeks back and it does seem that if one was to spend enough time here in City Hall Plaza between the distinguished visitors and those concerned with the good and welfare of the world who visit our city and who are always received here, of course, by the mayor, they would get a complete active cross-section of history in progress. The freedom bell itself was a magnificent piece of casting and its first strokes were heard right here in front of City Hall. The repetition strokes will take place in Berlin today. They will carry the message of hope and peace and understanding through unity and there does seem to be no reason why for any time to come. There does necessarily prevail certain conditions that have to be worked out to their final conclusion, not final in the end of anything, but final in the solution of the snags that so far have kept the situation from being a unanimous one for aspiration, for courage and for development. And when the work of the United Nations is done, that indeed will indicate the idea and purpose, the aspirations back of that group and its formation five years ago on our west coast and being celebrated so colorfully here on the east coast today in New York City. Hello, how are you? I do hope that some of our speaking program will get on because this parade seems endless it's still way down at St. Paul's, but Mr. Siegel, director of WNYC is right with us and we're depending on him for a signal is just what to do. I'm quite sure the mayor does want to get his greeting in on the radio, but with the marvelous facilities that exist today, it can be taped and recorded if by any chance the president of the United States wants to speak up at the UN building and the schedule there, I believe is a very tight one. New York always is able and ready to meet any situation and nothing seems to be too complicated for solution in the mechanical and engineering developments of today, the technical ones as well. Well, it's quieted down a little but the marchers are still going up Broadway. There's a band now about at the Woolworth building. St. Paul's Chapel is going through a complete renovation. It's being restored practically to its original beauty. A great deal of the stonework that was covered by bad woodwork and other necessary adjustments from time to time has all been removed. And pretty soon that chapel will look as beautiful as it did when George Washington and the first Congress of the United States organized at Wall Street and Nassau when George Washington took oath of office as first president of the United States. Well, that's a very hallowed building because it was in that building that they marched from the then capital of the United States, New York City to ask God's guidance and inspiration in a government that has turned out to be an inspiration and an idea for leadership for every group and every government in the world. The Constitution of the United States inspired as it is with the spiritual desire and hope and aspiration of God himself has certainly proved the efficacy of the spiritual values. The United States of America has indeed carried on from those early 13 colonies when those anxious men stood there at Wall and Nassau Street, little knowing what to expect from a great and powerful nation to whom they had too the courage to express an idea that they thought was a very good one and which has since proved to be a most excellent one, the United States of America. America. There's a great deal said about names. I don't think we say enough about George Washington and the Colonials. Their life, we might say, was so simple and so direct at the time and we might say of considerable less size than the nation today that we're inclined to overlook the fact that those great and wonderful founders, the founders of our great country, were the ones that had the courage and the foresight to establish this very thing that gives every man the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And that is being elucidated in its truer aspect and our understanding and comprehensions of freedom are becoming the spiritual values that they should be, not merely a license to abuse that which is a privilege. Well, Mr. Segal, what are we going to do? You want to say a word? Well, this is a magnificent parade here, Tommy. I mean, the idea of these different groups of citizens marching up Broadway, pretty much as their forebears did not so many years ago, up from Castle Garden. Well, here's Mr. Whelan now. Ladies and gentlemen and fellow Americans, the United States First Army Band will render the national anthem. Well, everybody, thank you very much further to for checking Muslims and, hopefully, Irish people getting several new things. I recommend each other to be a large tremendous fan of Flex team in the American purposes line for她 in the city of Colorado and queuilidad to address�대�して the standard ev익ly chains of all these things I have about to perform. Thank you. We thank you for a great conversation, actually. And they have to be like, oh将K, and you've spoken to me about the word? It's being like a little in a few words. But I don have to take her very much clarity to you, especially try to před up ourη have made some 처ries to this one. But I'm glad to embrace that much invaded let's say. So far! It seems like... I'm glad I'm glad to be. Thank you. Mayor Impelteri, this is the fifth birthday of the United Nations. There is gathered in the plaza of the City Hall all the national groups that compose the population of the great city of New York. And it is a demonstration of the United Nations at work in our home city because of the peace and quiet that reigns and the fact that everyone here who came through the portals of Castle Garden have found an opportunity for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. There is no better place to have a gathering of this nature than at the City Hall where George Washington, some 150 odd years ago, addressed his troops in their farewell speech. Mr. Mayor, it's a great privilege for me to present this gathering to you and ask you to make an address to them on this great occasion. Mayor Impelteri. To Whelan, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. Exactly four years ago yesterday, on October 23, 1946, I had the distinct honor as acting mayor to deliver the welcoming address at the formal opening of the General Assembly of the United Nations in Flushing Meadows Park. I then stated to President Truman, to United Nations President Paul Spock, and to the distinguished delegates from many nations, that our city had become the center of the hopes of the entire world. And that we were proud indeed to welcome the United Nations to our proud city. So much has happened since then. Brave deliberations of the United Nations. In this, their world capital have quickened free men's hopes and hearts everywhere. There are fewer doubting Thomases today than there were four years ago. Former faltering hesitancy and the uncertainty that went with it are giving way to decisive action that stirs men's souls throughout the world. Public opinion in our nation and in countries around the globe is gradually being molded for an even stronger and more determined United Nations in its mission to keep the peace among peoples and to beat back the aggression of communism and dictatorships. As your chief executive, it was my privilege and honor to proclaim this week as United Nations Week. And today, as United Nations Day, and to call upon all New Yorkers to instill in their hearts this year's timely slogan that UN plus you equals peace. May I extend the city's warm welcome to you on this fifth anniversary of the United Nations. And may almighty God guide the representatives of the United Nations in their task of restoring concord and amity among all the peoples of the earth. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Representing the United Nations is the distinguished Assistant Secretary General from Chile, the Honorable Benjamin Cohn. Mr. Cohn. Mr. Cohn. Mr. Cohn. Mr. Cohn. Mayor Impelicari. Distinguished guests. Ladies and gentlemen. It is indeed a privilege for me to be here today to acknowledge on behalf of the United Nations and not only of its Secretariat but also of all the delegations which are at this moment gathered in Flushing Meadow to listen to the President of the United States, the very warm and brotherly hospitality of this great city of New York. We have been with you here for four and a half years. We have had an opportunity in the span of time to receive from you, the people of New York, constant proofs and manifestations of your spirit of peace, of your welcome, of your generous and friendly opportunity to help us work for the world in peace that we all desire. You have given us, Mr. Mayor, here in this great city, all that we needed as an atmosphere to surround the United Nations. This is indeed, as has been said frequently, a city which represents a veritable United Nations. All races, all peoples, all cultures dwell together in peace, working for the common aim of human progress and human understanding. We of the United Nations are perfectly conscious of the great influence that you, the people of New York, have upon the spirit of all the men who come from the furthermost corners of the world to meet here and try to solve the difficulties now besetting the people. I wish to thank you very specially, Major Impeliteri, for your constant devotion and assistance to the United Nations. You have been a friend all through this year in which many wavered in their faith and in their loyalty to the principles of the Charter. But now you can stand with those of us who always believe that the United Nations would work because for the first time we have an international organization which speaks not only for governments but which is the true spokesman of the peoples of the world, an organization which is willing to exercise all the resources for Pacific settlement but which has also shown it can bear arms against aggression and it can fight in the field of battle to establish the highest principles of human conviviality. This great city of New York is a fitting one to harbor the United Nations. And when, in the course of the first months of 1951, we move our whole operation from late success to Manhattan, we will feel that much closer to you, that much more bound to you, the people of New York, because in our beautiful building of stone, of concrete and iron and glass, we will try to serve you better to help you so that you may also help us achieve the ideal of world understanding and peace. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you all citizens of New York for the very warm hospitality which you give us the United Nations. I promise you in this fifth anniversary of the coming into effect of the Charter that we shall every day strive further to carry out the ideals of San Francisco and to crystallize them into realities for the welfare and the happiness of mankind. Thank you, Mr. Cone. Out in St. Albans Hospital, there are 450 veterans from the Korean War who have been transferred from Korea to our own city here and are now being cared for out of the Naval Hospital at St. Albans. It was the thought of the mayor and his committee that today we should not forget those who served, who made the supreme sacrifice and those who were wounded in that very great and very successful engagement in Korea. And so the International Bakery and Confectionary Workers, Union of America has presented a cake to the mayor and the mayor in turn will cut the first piece of cake and then it will be cut up into 450 pieces and with the compliments of the mayor sent to St. Albans Hospital this afternoon. Mr. Mayor, the President Emeritus of the International Bakers and Confectionary Workers Union wishes to present this cake to you personally. Will Mr. Winters, Herman Winters, step forward? I didn't see you. Thank you. We knew, of course, that the United Nations was having a birthday, its fifth birthday anniversary. So we baked a cake. And I have been selected by our group to present this cake to you, Mr. Mayor, and I do so with the good wishes of our great international union. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. And now you've heard the description of the cake and Mayor Impeletere with the chairman of the union board and Mr. Whelan are going down to cut the cake and you can depend on those photographers. Mr. Whelan. The mayor is going to get the assistance and charming services of his wife to help him cut the cake. Mrs. Impeletere now is going down to the cake. The mayor, Mr. Impeletere, is leaving the platform now to go down and cut this very beautiful cake. which has been donated by the Baker's Union. Play there. And I get only work first in the... Les Andes de Courte. How do you say that? I hear you. Hi. And the Baker's Union are going down to be in the picture too. Mrs. Impeletere is very charming in a sort of a nash's of rose coat and a black velvet hat with a veil and her very proud husband, the mayor, is escorting her down to the point where the cake is to be cut. Now, you really haven't missed anything if you haven't television because those photographers are down there and they won't miss a crumb of this cake in bringing it to you in the various periodicals and newspapers tomorrow. And it's very important, of course, that you really realize that some of the extravagant compliments I've paid this turnout today are an actual fact when you see pictures. Because without a doubt, it's the most interesting and beautiful pageant crowded with every inch of color and activity that has possibly ever taken place here in City Hall. Because the pageant itself is a very huge one. Generally, the audience is very huge. The audience itself is huge today too. But the pageant itself is crowding a great deal of the space and every known kind of flag complements the array of United Nations flags that are decorating the portico of City Hall itself, combined as they are with our own city and stars and stripes and the United Nations flag as well. Mr. John Golden, who brought such a wonderful note to the American theater of picking out those who thought they were distressed and unfortunate and working out through the medium of the theater and the play and the actor and the artist, the solution of problems is consistently chairman of New York City's United Nations Committee. Mr. Golden is very busy in the picture. He hasn't spoken as yet, and I hope our airtime lasts till he does. Mr. Golden produced those very beautiful shows that we all know, so wonderfully human. And now the band is striking up. Happy birthday. Everything is so appropriate. And what unity. Different colors, it's true. But it's the color and beauty and the difference of colors that make the mosaic the beautiful thing it is. The photographers are demanding a great deal of Mr. and Mrs. Impelitari while this cake is being cut, and it's consuming a great deal of time. Mr. Whelan's watching very closely in his own benevolent way. Did you want to get out? There's a lady who wants to get out. Don't fall now. Take it easy. Take it easy now. There's a big laugh down there, but the crowd around the stand here and everything else precludes any view of the scene. But we can imagine what's going on with a huge cake of that kind being cut. And as Mr. Whelan pointed out, after the solicitation of Mayor Impelitari, the cake is being sent out to St. Albans Hospital to the Korean veterans out there because they really are the ones that cut the cake. They've proved to us the futility of war by their bravery in asserting its power and fact. And yet we hope to see the day when the very thing we're observing here in City Hall Plaza today will make us realize and rationalize differences to the point where destruction will completely fade from the scene at the same time that fear goes out with it. It's very important that we understand the ramifications of these things. How often have you met a person that you didn't like the first time? I remember a particular occasion of someone that I had never gotten along very well with, and then an accident happened, and I was the only one there. Now, a strange thing happens in a case like that. You never think of anything else but the fact that someone has been hurt or injured, and you immediately go to their assistance without any reference to the past or anything of the kind. And then, out of that, came a lasting friendship. Why does it have to be that way? Eventually, we hope it'll be the other way around, that we'll know and understand the other fellow's problem and help him work it out, the same as he'll work with us on anything we have to do. It's true. It's true. It's true. It's not going to be just a... Just a moment or something. No, that's not it. It doesn't just have to be colorless and we might even say shiftless. Everything that's important will remain just the same, but we'll work out the problem. If smiles and greetings are any indication of this United Nations party here in front of City Hall, well, then everybody is happy and hoping. And after all, hope is the fundamental of all accomplishment. There's a character in Dickens. I forget the lady's name, but she drops her H and says, you can't do nothing without hope. Mayor, it's Mayor, Mrs. Imbelle Terry. To come back to the stand, we go on with Rosetti. Mr. Whalen has just announced that Mr. and Mrs. Imbelle Terry and the Bakers are coming back to the stand. What we ought to strike up here is the music of the gills in the final scene of Meister Singer when all the various gills come in to take part in the song fest. Again, we get back to music and music's exquisite harmonies that we'll translate someday into life itself. Of course, music paints a dark picture occasionally, too. But the ending is always a thing of beauty and harmony when the various counterpoints are harmonized into a beautiful finale. The Bakers are back on the stand, and I guess in just a moment now, the mayor will take his place. Mr. Whalen will make the announcement, and I do hope that Mr. Golden gets on the air before we conclude our broadcast. They're making way now. There's Mrs. Imbelle Terry, and there's the mayor. They're going down on the stand now. They had to go up the steps and around and down to where the cake was in front, and your faithful photographers have taken care of the fact that you'll see just what it all looked like in the pictures tomorrow. The mayor is detained by a few personal greetings, which, of course, is very nice, but not so good when he's so busy. It's always good to hear from a well-wisher, even though prodigal is somewhat avoided in doing so. Mr. Whalen is benevolently down there trying to straighten out everybody and get them back in their places again so that our program will come back to its momentum. And now Mr. Whalen looks as though he's ready to... Mr. Whalen. October 24th at the City Hall ceremony in observance of the fifth anniversary of the United Nations, naturalized citizens, will be honored by the presentation of certificates of recognition by Mayor Impelitari. However, the list is so large that the committee has chosen three or four to symbolize the presentation, and following that, the rest of the certificates will be given to those entitled to them at the Mayor's Committee at 500 Park Avenue. Will Mrs. Rothblock come here and present to the Mayor the three people who are to receive the certificate? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And read it. The first person... The first person is Miss Lydia Sodastrong. She was born in Sweden. She was naturalized 64 years ago. When she landed here in 1881, Brooklyn Bridge was not finished, and she remembers that she went between Brooklyn and Manhattan by way of South Ferry, and she's always been a Brooklyn resident. Miss Lydia Sodastrong. Anyone? Miss Sodastrong is in national costume with a red embroidered hat with white lace around it, and the mayor is posing now with the... for the photographers rather, with Miss Sodastrong. Brooklyn Bridge not being built didn't keep her from getting to Brooklyn, and that's important because Brooklyn's a wonderful place. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. The next person we have the honor of presenting is Mrs. Bernhard Glinski, who was born in Germany. She was naturalized 59 years ago. She named her oldest son, George, after the father of our country, and her first daughter, Martha, after his wife. She is the mother of nine children, grandmother to 21 grandchildren, a great-grandmother to 13, thus at the age of 86, she has 43 descendants. Mrs. Glinski. The mayor is posing now with Mrs. Glinski, and she herself is really a very alert person. It's hard to believe the description that was read about her because she's very keen and certainly gets around with all that accomplishment to her credit. She's dressed all in black and presents a very dignified, motherly, and beautiful picture. The mayor has just posed with her. The next person has been naturalized 63 years. She is now 83 years old. She was born in Germany. Mrs. Bertha Adams, who resides in Forest Hill. Mrs. Adams is a very fine-looking lady with beautiful silver hair and the black velvet hat trimmed with silver that matches her hair beautifully, and she is all dressed in black, and she's having quite a conversation with the mayor. She's excellently poised, and she moves around very spryly. These descriptions don't seem to match at all. These people look so healthy and happy and so marvelous for the wonderful things they've accomplished. And now the mayor is waiting just a moment because the photographers are not satisfied, and of course they tell everybody what to do, and it's a good thing they do because it's through their orders that we see the picture, and a picture tells a huge story. Mr. Charles Corp was born in Latvia in 1865. He was naturalized 57 years ago. He has five children, 18 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren, thus 35 descendants, many of whom are here today. Mr. Corp. The mayor now greets this gentleman, Mr. Corp, and he's having quite a little confab. We have quite a contrast between the young and handsome face of the mayor and the elderly face of his guest, and yet both of them are virile, full of life, full of smiles, and full of greeting to each other. And now Maria Savage of the Metropolitan Opera is taking her place. Mr. Joseph Pope was born in Italy. He landed at Castle Garden in 1879. He has five children, 10 grandchildren. He is active now in the Baker's Union Local 50. Mr. Pope. Oh, I missed that one. The baker goes ahead of the lady. He's all in white, and I didn't realize that he was going to be honored here. And he's dressed like a baker and ready to bake another cake, and he's greeting the mayor. Madam Maria Savage, known as the grand lady of the Metropolitan Opera Chorus, of which she was a member from 1908 until 1945. As a feature of United Nations Day, your city station has been bringing you the proceedings of the Metropolitan. Both of her daughters have been members of the Metropolitan Chorus. And one of her daughters is still active in characterizations made notable by her mother. We now present Madam Savage. And with her are two other naturalized citizens. The Metropolitan base, born in Russia, Mr. Gerhard Pechner. Mr. Pechner is going up now to take his place with Maria Savage, or Savage, as we translate it into English. We have a savage in our organization. Madam Savage is really the trooper. She stands there and straightens up like a real artist as she's greeted by the mayor, and now comes back with the scroll in her hand. John Golden is shaking hands with her. And she certainly has seen many beautiful scenes there on the stage at the opera. Now Mr. Pechner is being honored by the mayor and receives his scroll. We all know his splendid work on the stage there, too. We can look back on Madam Savage and the beautiful character bits which she brought to the main scenes of the opera. Now Mr. Whelan. Dugan will present for the American Junior Red Cross presentation to the mayor. Mr. Dugan has several paintings. He's going to speak now. Mr. Dugan. Mayor Pelletieri, honored guests and friends, on behalf of the one million New York City students who are members of the Junior Red Cross, I wish to express our sincere belief in and hope for the continued success of the United Nations. As part of the vast international program of Junior Red Cross, we have worked to spread goodwill and friendship among the young peoples of the world. Every country in Europe is familiar with the Junior Red Cross gift boxes, which have been packed by the hundreds of thousands by students in our schools as friendly gifts to children in other lands. Last year, New York City high schools filled 56 school chests, which have already been received abroad. These chests each contain enough supplies for 48 children for one year. Through the National Children's Fund of the American Junior Red Cross, needy children everywhere have received food, medicine, clothing, and school supplies whenever and wherever needed. There are some programs in which New York City students are especially interested. These are the activities which involve an exchange of ideas and talents, for it is through these projects that we come to understand our friends of other lands. One of the most popular of these programs is the preparation of international correspondence albums. These albums have been exchanged with countries in every continent all over the world. Similar to the correspondence booklets, there are also an exchange of record albums, which contain examples of music that typify the country. Last year, New York City schools sent through the Junior Red Cross more than 500 pictures depicting scenes of American life. These also have been received abroad and are now decorating walls of schools throughout the world. May Impelle Terry, it gives me great pleasure to present to you these pictures of American life and this album from Denmark. May Impelle Terry, it gives me great pleasure to present to you these pictures of American life. The mayor is now receiving the gift of pictures of American life, their watercolors. They look like an aftermath of our art festival of last week. The mayor is posing with the donor and the Junior Red Cross chairman. The photographers have had their innings and you'll see that one particular picture he held up because the photographers are telling him just how to hold it and which way to get the right light. They're quite a hanging committee when it comes to taking pictures and photographing them. And now Mr. Whelan. Thank you, my behalf. Mayor Impelle Terry has asked me to thank the Junior American Red Cross for their contribution of the portraits and paintings which are to be delivered to St. Albans Hospital. This is a special day in the week of the UN. It is known as UN Day. And for this special day's program, the mayor appointed, rather the national committee appointed two members of our community in the city of New York. John L. Golden as the chairman and as the co-chairman Mrs. Vincent Impelle Terry. They have worked days and nights working up the program which you have participated in this afternoon and I wish to take this opportunity of congratulating both of them for their services in connection with UN Day. It's a great pleasure for me to present the chairman of the UN Day, Mr. John Golden. This is the first time that I have been advised by the Tsar of New York, Grover Whelan, that I was even allowed to speak. All that's happened to me during the last eight weeks is to keep working with one of the most lovely ladies that I've ever had the good fortune to know. I'm going to ask her because she acts not as the wife of your first citizen, but as a co-worker with me in the field of whatever is happening now. She, day after day, suggestion after suggestion, came along and said, let's try this, do that or the other, even though they might or might not like it. I'm going to ask you to meet, if she's not permitted to do anything more than to show you her proctudinous exquisiteness, I'm going to ask you to look upon the features of the wife of the mayor, in other words, the first lady of New York City, Mrs. Impelletari, my co-worker, my co-chairman in this job. Will you please rise and take a bow? They've asked me to be chairman, and among the pleasant duties that I've had are, for instance, the thought that Mrs. Impelletari really gave me, which was to ask all of the children in the high schools to participate, one of the junior high schools, to participate in an essay, an essay on what? On what we're celebrating today, the fifth birthday of the United Nations. There are a great many holidays in the world. There is everything from Pesach to Christmas, from Fourth of July to Guy Fawkes Day, but there is only one day, only one day in all of the world that can be celebrated all around the world by every nation, that can be celebrated happily today because we're getting ourselves out of a lot of trouble all over there in Korea. And that is the date, October 24th, the fifth birthday of that grand, that glorious, that marvelous institution in the United Nations. And on this fifth birthday, it was Mrs. Impelletari's idea, and mine too, to give prizes to those children in the high schools who might best show their ability at expressing in less than a hundred words their notions of what this meant to them. And so, you'd be very much interested, I'm sure, to know, as I was yesterday, to be told by Miss Mary Kennedy of the Board of Education that under her general supervision, some 30,000, 30,000 children, boys and girls, participated in that essay contest. That's a lot of kids to work thinking of the United Nations, and that's the only way we can keep the United Nations going, by having the, oh, we won't win it with guns, we'll win it spiritually. We'll win it because there are such a thing as 30,000 children writing essays on why the United Nations is a good thing for us. And in a minute, you're going to hear one of those kids. Well, 30,000 were screened down through 90 high schools. 90 high schools then gave us down to two apiece or 180. Those were screened further down through the English teachers until we got down to a final six, which were handed to me and my committee. After studying the six and with some difficulty determining upon the best one, because they were all pretty sweet, we selected one, and she's here, and so are the others. I think the others are here if Mrs. Emma Rothblatt has done her work. They should be. Pause while the old man puts on his glasses. They should be. And each of the ones I am reading now are getting consolation prizes from me of $10 each. James Sparupolis. Is he here? James? Here is your consolation prize. Congratulations, James. The next is a little girl who told me she fixed her own name so it was better than Lizzie. She made herself Liz Olette Weiss. Liz Olette gets a consolation prize. Come Lizzie. Next is a youngster named Jay Turum who wrote a beautiful article and has poetry in his nature. Jay. Then comes Emily Fisher. Here, Emily, is your check. Now, little Phyllis Leifer. Junior high school, 13 and a half years old. Come on, Phyllis, take your little check. Good luck to you with it, because there's a smart girl, Phyllis. There was one that had a prayer here, but we haven't time to mention all the good works that these kids did. But out of a clear sky, I found the one that I like best, and she's going to get what I think looks to her like a fortune. It's a $100 check for having written 100 words. Thus, a kid in one of our high schools gets a dollar a word for her little essay. And so I'm going to bring to you the girl who describes her own home, if she'll try to express it here. She describes her own home as a United Nations. She even has imagination enough to mention the sky vault, the heavens above all of us, which brings us all together as one people all over the world in the United Nations. I had created a little slogan called UN plus U equals peace. And that was the subject that the kids were to take. And so little Elaine Wade, the prize winner, is here before you. And Elaine will now read her 100 word prize winning poem. Come to the microphone, Elaine. The apartment house I live in is like the United Nations. People that live there are of many nationalities. Chinese, Spanish, French, Greek, American, and others. Here we have people from all parts of the world living under one roof, serving one God in many different ways. Being educated in schools and churches to love their neighbors, to fight intolerance, to uproot racial discrimination. The world is your house. The heavens form your roof. The people are the tenants. And God watches over us all. You and you and you, wherever you are in this world, live like good neighbors in love, affection, and kindness for each other. Then you will be living proof of our formula. You and you and you. You and you. You and you. You and you. You and you. You and you. You and I will be living proof of your life for all eternity. Thank you, dear. Now, come and let the photographer see how you look. And now Elaine is being presented to Mary and Pelletere. and the photographers are demanding a picture after reading of her beautiful thought and concept of unity in a transposition of the home in which she lives that has so many nationalities and then the world is all our home with the blue sky for a roof and our unity and love for each other and the fabric that binds us together. The mayor and John Golden are now posing with Elaine and it certainly is a happy moment for her. She seems to pay more attention to that than the $100 which John Golden gave her. At least it's a good start for the young lady, a dollar a word. Many a great author would like to get that for his writings. Now Mrs. Impeletere is joining the party at the request of Mr. Golden and Elaine is certainly a very proud and happy little girl. Mr. Whelan now is coming up to the microphone because I imagine time is of the essence. And this has indeed been a very essential and beautiful ceremony here today. Mr. Whelan waits patiently but not convinced that the photographer should take so much time but they're taking it and it's a good picture and it's a great moment for Elaine. And now a round of handshakes by the mayor. Thank you Mr. Golden. And now Mr. Whelan. Now when you get an author and producer to work at the ripe age of 70, what is it John? What? 76. 76. Yeah. And do a job such he's done today. I think we all ought to indicate our appreciation of his work by applauding John Golden. Of course all the ideas came from Mrs. Impeletere. You know all these authors get ideas from intelligent and fascinating women and that's where he got all his ideas. Now we're going to close the program with a few dances by nationality group. Carpathian Russian choir. Are they up front here or have they been lost in this great crowd? It's pretty difficult to assemble anything out of this crowd because the crowd is so dense it takes a great deal of time to even get through it if you have to. Mr. Whelan's looking patiently for his choir but it's not allowed. At the same time we'll have the Chinese double dragon dance come up. Well the two dragons are right here and they'll be up in a moment. Come right up. To the center of the plaza. And believe me the Chinese can take credit for the most colorful part of this pageant today because their exquisite embroideries, flowers and color are marvelous indeed. I'll turn this around. Maybe you can hear the beating of the drums. Mr. Whelan wants them up further. Move the dragons up further. There they go. And now this very picturesque scene. Two dragons in a duet dance in front of City Hall. Can you hear the sound of the beat of the tom-toms and drums? And we'll be right back. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. This is a picnic for the photographers because certainly nothing more picturesque has ever taken place here than this dragon dance. And then the natives of Chinatown, I say the natives of Chinatown, and that I want to convey the picture of their oriental costume because of course they're natives of New York. They've brought us the beautiful oriental art of their ancient land in some of their costuming here this morning, and it certainly makes a beautiful background for what is taking place. Even the embroidered banners have moved up. The flag of China mingles with the flag of the United States. And thus in the dance of these two dragons we have a unity of its kind. No doubt you can hear the beating of the drums down there and the rhythm that accents the various motions of the two dragons. It's interesting to watch Maria Sauvage of the Metropolitan push to the front because the spectacle no doubt appeals to her. And they make way for this splendid lady of the opera. Now the dragons are just about concluding their dance. Mr. Whelan will announce the next feature. He just thanked them very courteously but the dragons themselves do not seem to feel that they have concluded all they had to dance. So they're dancing out the theme they started. And now they're going down to a period of exhaustion and becoming a flattened prone in front of the distinguished company here at City Hall. Now they're bowing to each other. And they're still in a state of very pleasant diplomacy. Despite Mr. Whelan's thanks, the dance continues. Now with profound bows, they're leaving their scene and they certainly have made it a lively one. The two dragons. And now Mr. Whelan has just asked for the Philippine dancers. These beautiful gauzes that the Filipinos wear, they're a beautiful quality. They remind us a good deal of the costumes we noted on some ladies from India, a different way of course. The Indian ladies seem to take one beautiful embroidered or spangled piece of gauze and make a costume of it. But these are regularly designed and sewed costumes. And they have those big leg of mutton sleeves that take us back to the 90s almost. And they're so sheer and beautiful that they create a very fine effect indeed. Very, very vivid in color. It seems to be a very interesting Spanish quality because Spanish architecture, Spanish art, especially in this Baroque period, it was very vivid in color. That's things to explain to him. innovatedRE R Online Oh Oh Licor financing Oh Oh Aalit Mahor Malagut ang Hininga The dance which we are going to dance is coconut shell dance. In Filipino language we call it bow dance. Nothing very much is happening I guess in order to dance they really do need some music and the musicians are getting down there now and forming and the ladies in these very vivid gauze costumes are about to take their place. By the way those very sheer shirts that the men are wearing of the same material are quite a night in for summer wear. But it's pretty chilly here in front of City Hall today and now the dance is in progress. Can you hear anything? incorporated a nanny to walk the� X. Okay, this is a photo strip. I have to start right in the event. I have to do this because you haven't done work properly. Let's Já deixe el ι Art of New York. It does benefit from the mood so it is an easier result in the person. Thank you. intrigue No! The Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Mayor, I've... ...and now the Philippine dance have just been concluded. And Mr. Whelan is... ...and there are two certificates we should like you... ...to ask you to present before we close our program. While they're getting that ready, Miss Paula Lechner, Metropolitan Opera Soprano... ...is also one of our naturalized citizens being honored today. And so is Mrs. Anna Matica, born in Czechoslovakia and naturalized 67 years ago. Mrs. Matica. Mrs. Matica gets her certificate and the Metropolitan is again represented. We're just waiting now for an announcement from Mr. Whelan. For those who may have tuned in late, may we say that the City of New York... ...is demonstrating here in front of City Hall... ...its observance of the fifth anniversary of United Nations. And now some music. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... in a few minutes all over the world, including the Freedom Bell, which is in Berlin at the moment. Mr. Whelan is tying together, however, at this time, the fact that we're synchronizing the ringing of the Freedom Bell in Berlin with all the church bells of our city. And in just a few moments, and there are the bells now. And now the bells, St. Paul's in our immediate vicinity, St. Andrew's, which is just behind the municipal building, Trinity Church, which is down at Rector and Broadway, and many of the little chapels up through Roosevelt Street on the east side there. And the bells of the city are now ringing. And we've heard the expression, let freedom ring, and that's what we're all working for. Freedom to do the right thing, to do the constructive thing. Freedom to be part of a great world ensemble for the good of all. I don't know how sharp the radio pickup is, but... Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes the ceremonies of UN Day. May I dismiss your commands? And so with the ringing of the bells and let freedom ring, we take leave of you from City Hall Plaza in the fifth annual celebration of the anniversary of United Nations. The sight of the village steeple is one of the greatest inspirations to patriotism. And the bells from time immemorial have been hung in the churches and cathedrals, and they have always stood for freedom and the freedom of thought through the spiritual values. And today we've had almost a village effect. As I started to say a few moments ago, the pickup may not have been very sharp, but the distant effect here, listening to the church bells in and around City Hall, a location which still has many churches serving its people, why these church bells almost made us think of the quiet little village as we heard the sound of those bells ringing from the different steeples around the City Hall here. Well, that is about all from the City Hall. We've brought you every detail, as good as we may, in describing for you a scene that would have to be witnessed to realize its true splendor, but above all things, the actual participation of everyone in the thought and idea of peace on earth to men of goodwill. That is all from City Hall. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
