What's in a family? We've got to cut expenses. If we don't... Mother, our house is so shabby. I'm ashamed to bring the girls here. I'll get a job, Dad. And go to college next year instead. Now, don't worry, Dad. Don't worry. I don't like that boy she's going with, Henry. What are we going to do about it? She won't hear a word of criticism again. I'll get a job somewhere. Sure I will. Cheer up, Mary. Children, your grandmother is very tired. Please try and play more quietly. Please. What's in a family? Ambitions, adjustments, frustrations, achievements, failure. They're all part of every family's living. Like the story of the Blake family who... But let's start in at the beginning. In the home economics class of the Unionville High School. The fall term is just getting underway. Miss Dale, the home economics instructor, is speaking just before the class is over. I want to make clear once more why I've assigned these home projects. Modern home economics is designed to cover the entire field of homemaking, with special emphasis on happy family relationships. Therefore, by putting into practice at home what you learn here, you will demonstrate how to become successful home members, homemakers, and more successful members of society. Alice Ames, will you tell us what home projects you have chosen? I thought a lot about it, Miss Dale. And I think my mother works too hard. She never has any time for herself. And you're going to do something about it? Yes, ma'am. My home project will be to work out a schedule so my mother can have at least half a day a week. To do just as she pleases. I think that's a fine project, Alice. And now, let's hear from Mary Blake. Mary? Mary? I don't know. I can't make up my mind. I... Mary? Mary Blake? Yes, Miss Dale? Do you have a class next period? No, ma'am. I'm through for today. So am I, Mary. Would you like to talk over your home project with me? Why, there's nothing to talk about. Sit down, Mary. Perhaps I can help you pick out a project. It's no use, Miss Dale. You can't help me. Nobody can. I can't pass this course in homemaking. I'm going to quit. But our work has just started, Mary. Are you ill? Is anything... No. But I'm sick of home. I'm sick of everything. Would you like to tell me about it? It wouldn't do any good. It might. And of course, anything you tell me is strictly confidential. Well, all right. But all the other girls in class, they don't have any real problems, Miss Dale. They have nice homes. Every home has problems, Mary. Even the nice ones. I don't see how. Everything's wrong at our house. That's why I signed up for this course. I thought it would help. But it can't. Why not? Because, well, first of all, Paul is out of a job. He got fired at the paper and pulp mill six months ago. Has he tried to get another job? No, that's the worst of it, Miss Dale. He just... Well, it's like this. Mary, go in and try and get your pa up. Will you? Ma, I've been in six times already. He won't budge. He says he wants to sleep some more. All he does is sleep. Dear me, here comes Howard. Oh, dear. Hello, Ma. Hi, sis. Had supper yet? We're keeping yours warm for you. Okay. Where's Paul? Um, her... Why, um... I get it. Sleeping again, huh? That's all he does is sleep. No, Howard. Your father is... Listen, Ma. He sleeps too much. He might use some of that time to hike around. Try to find a job. Heck, why? That's the way it's been, Miss Dale, for months. It's getting worse every day. Perhaps your father is discouraged, Mary. We don't know what's the matter with him. And there's a regular fight between Howard and Paul every week when Howard... Here you are, Ma. The week's wages. Thank you, Howard. We don't have a cent left from last week. We wouldn't be in this boat if Paul would try... Now, Howard. It won't do any good to start all that over again. Shh. Here comes your pa. Start what all over? Oh, hello, Paul. I was just talking about the usual things. Oh, dull. Oh, griping again, huh? Hmm. That's right. Today is payday at the mill. How about handing me a dollar? Jim, I'm having a hard time making ends meet these days. Well, you can cut down somewhere. I need some cash. What for? That's my business. Sure. And it's my business to support this family while my pa sleeps all day long. I got a right to know when my wages go. Oh, oh, oh. Oh. And our house in Dale, it's a mess. Ma can't keep it clean. And my little sister, Rosie, well, she... She won't... Rosie, you better go wash your hands and face. I don't want to. Rosie, please. Your supper's almost ready. I don't want any supper. I eat with pa this afternoon. Then go out and play. I don't want to. Ma, my tummy ache. Then go lie down. No, I'm going out and play. All right. Mary, will you bring out those dishes? Your pa was eating in there today. I declare dishes everywhere. No order, nothing. I see. Mary, do you and your family ever talk matters over? Ma and I do. But Ma feels just like Pa now. She doesn't know which way to turn. I don't either. That's why I guess this homemaking course can't help. Mary, I believe it can help. I don't see how. I'll show you. First of all, Mary, if you and your mother reorganize your house, have meals served on time, do the cleaning on schedule, you'll all feel better. No, we won't. You don't know my family. They won't eat on time. They won't pick up things. They... Mary, you must try. And keep trying. Don't give up before you begin. But why even start when it's hopeless? I hate home. I'm going to leave. I'm going to New York or somewhere far away and get a job. What kind of a job? Oh, well, something, anything, even if it's only housework. Housework begins at home, Mary. What do you mean? I mean your home, Mary. Why go to the city to do housework for somebody else when there's a challenging job of homemaking waiting to be done, right in your own house? But, Miss Dale, it's hopeless. Mary, the hardest part is getting started. But even if I tried, Paul would ruin it. He says he'll never get another job, but nobody wants to hire him. Mary, I think your father's problem will work itself out in time. Now, the first thing to be done is this. You and your mother work together to establish order in the house. Mary, you have a wonderful home project cut out for you. Please try it. Please. Well, I'll try, Miss Dale. But if it doesn't work, I'm going away. Mary, if it doesn't work, the next step is up to you. Oh, that was a job, Ma. Yes, it was. But the place looks a lot better now. I never knew we had so much stuff around, Ma. Maybe we can use these old rag for a rag rug sometime. Why, that's a good idea, Mary. Now, let's see. The next thing to do is the dusting. I'll do it, Ma. What's dusting? Dusting is keeping the dust off things. You go out and play, Rosie. I'm going to watch Mary dust. I don't know, Rosie. Everybody who stays in the house works. Pa doesn't. Do you want to help? Is it fun? Well, I think so. If you polish this table, Rosie, you can pretend it's a mirror or a lake. And you can see yourself in it. Oh, show me how. All right, let's start. Here, and then... Mary, you are smart. Ma, that's the first time you've laughed in months. Well, I feel like laughing, Mary. The way Rosie is helping us, bless her little heart. She's upstairs now at the North Pole. North Pole? Uh-huh. She's making the beds, Ma. She says the sheets are snow and ice. Well, I never... Ma, we're making some headway. Yes, if we could only hang on to it. How can I get any sleep around here with all this thumping and talking going on? Pa, we're giving the house a real clean. It needs it. I need my sleep, too. Here, Jim. Take this. Then when you come back, we'll have the house all done and supper on. Okay, but it's a fine thing when a man gets run out of his own house. Guess I'm not wanted around here. I wish Pa wouldn't say things like that. Just takes the joy out of everything when he goes on like that. I guess he'll never change. What's the use? Ma, you can start your garden. Yes, you can. There's no time for it, Mary. What with the housework, the washing, and trying to get your new system of housework going. Things are a little better now, Ma. Rosie's helping us for one thing, and Howard comes home to supper on time, most of the time anyhow. Yes, it all helps, but I still don't have time to get in the garden. Ma, Miss Dale says we can do it this way. From now on, I'll take charge of getting supper and cleaning the house, and you can have time to get your garden going. She said that? Yes. Ma, it'll work. I know it will. Well, we could save money that way. We could grow beets, carrots, peas, a lot of things. And the seeds wouldn't cost much, but... Ma, we've got to try it. But if your Pa finds out we're spending money on a garden, he... Don't worry about Pa. Our job's to get that garden in somehow. Now, don't you worry. But, Miss Dale, it's no use. Pa's worse than ever. How, Mary? Oh, he complains. He's mean to Ma. He and Howard argue all the time. He makes threats. And then Howard gets mad and says all sorts of things. Does Howard understand your father's situation? Yes. He said Paul lost out at the mill because he loafed on the job. What did your father say to that? Oh, he said his eyes weren't so good and that he was too stiff to move fast enough in the last job he had. And Paul's selfish, Miss Dale. He won't try to get another job. He's lazy. Mary, I think your father's maladjusted. Maladjusted? Yes. Think of it this way. A combination of causes has resulted in your father's losing his job. Your brother, Howard, has had to step in and be wage earner for your father. Try and understand how humiliating this is to him, the head of the family, depending on his son to support him. Your father needs help, Mary. But all we do is help him. I mean another kind of help, Mary. Moral support. Sympathy. You mean feel sorry for him? No, not that. But kind to him. Yes, help him build up his pride again. Oh, I see what you mean. Your father will get a job again, Mary. Oh, no he won't, Miss Dale. Not Paul. He's been worse than ever since that day you came to see us. Mary, keep trying. Now, I have an idea. Why don't you and the family enter into a little conspiracy to be nice to your father without telling him a thing about it? You mean tell Howard not to argue with him? That's part of it, yes. But it's a job for the whole family. Why don't all of you get together and make your father feel that he is loved and respected? Try it, Mary. Well, we'll try anything you say, Miss Dale. But one thing is certain. Nothing we can do will ever help Paul get a job again. I don't know. Jim? Yeah? You can read better over here. There's more light. Well, that's something new. Worrying about my eyes, eh? Well, my eyes are okay. Paul, please come over here by the lamp. There's a newspaper, Paul. Say, what's the big idea? All this sweetness and light stuff. Okay, I'll come over. There. You can see here, Jim. Sit down. Pa, there's a story about the mill in tonight's paper. What are you trying to do? Rub it in again about me not having a job? No, Pa. Honest. But I thought you'd like to read it. It tells all about Joe Jacobs. Your name's in it, too. All the old-timers are. That's so. Hmm. Here it is. Oh. Front page, too. Pa, Miss Dale saw the story in the early morning paper. She showed it to me. Who's she? Why, Pa, you met her here at home several months ago. Remember? She's my home economics teacher. Oh, yeah. Is that the one that stuck her nose into our affairs? Now, Jim, she didn't do any such thing. She's a very nice young lady, Miss Dale is. She's taught Mary lots of things. How to alter dresses. How to budget. How to can vegetables. How to... Oh, so that's where all this reform stuff has been coming from, eh? Seems like everybody has a finger in the pie but me. Forget it, Pa. You've done lots for us. It's our turn to do something for you. Well, for the love of Mike, what's eating you all? Making out that I'm a swell guy after all, huh? You are, Jim. Sure. Okay. If I'm such a big shot, how about forking over some dough? I could use another 50 cents. Mary, will you get the money? Yes, Ma. Say. Say, what's the big idea? It's the first time I ever asked for dough without having to go to war for it. Here's the money, Ma. All right. Ten, twenty-five, thirty-five, forty, fifty. Here you are, Jim. Better take a dollar, Pa. We can spare it. Can't we, Ma? I think so. We've saved Mary three dollars. Sure, Pa. Why not? There's a good show on at the palace tonight. Maybe you and the folks would all like to go. Me and the folks? Why, well, can you beat that? No. No. Put it back. I don't want any dough. I'm going to bed. And sleep. I'm tired. Sleep. Sleep. That's all he does. Sleep. Jim. Jim. Jim. We've got enough saved now, so you can go and see about your eyes. My eyes are okay. No, they aren't. Or you wouldn't have those headaches you started talking about last week. You go get your eyes looked through, Jim. Why? I'm no good for nothing. Why get my eyes fixed? Mary says you'll feel a lot better, Jim. We all want you to, Jim. Well, who do I go to? Mary says to Dr. Hartwell in the Brown Building. Doc Hartwell? I used to know him when I was a kid. Well, nothing else to do. Guess I'll amble in and talk to him. But it's a waste of time and money. A big waste. Look, Paul, please. Look what Ma's done. From her garden. Canned peas, beets, and carrots. So what? Don't you see, Paul? We can have vegetables from our own garden all winter long. We'll save money. Not with winter coming on, we won't. We'll worry about winter when it gets here, Paul. Look, here's a surprise for you, Paul. Something you like. Something I like. Crabapple jelly. Ma and I got a big basket of windfall sheep the other day and made jelly. Well, why, uh... Oh, you've shown Jim the jelly. I wanted to surprise him at supper tonight. Guess the jelly will taste just as good, even if I do know about it ahead of time. Mary's making biscuits too, Jim. Remember when we were married, how you used to like my biscuits and crabapple jelly? Oh, um, yeah. Well, I'm going out. Be back for supper. Same time. Six. That's right. Six o'clock. Ma, Lucy's coming to meals on time now. At night, anyhow. That's something. Isn't it, Ma? Gosh, it's getting late, Ma. Guess I have time for another cup of coffee, though. Then I got to scram. Well, why, hello, Pa. Good morning. Hello. Hello. Morning, son. Morning, everybody. Breakfast ready? Why, of course, Jim. Sit down here. I'll get your coffee right away. Ma, you're all nice and cleaned up. Anybody object? Pa, you look swell. I bet your new glasses help your eyes, too, don't they? Haven't noticed any change yet. You will. Here, Pa, have some jelly. Here's your coffee, Jim. And eggs. It's kind of nice. All of us sitting down to breakfast again. Just like old times. Except that this time, I'm all spruced up with no place to go. Shoot. Why worry about it, Pa? I still got my job. Sure. If I had any gumption, I'd still have mine, too. Jim, what's past is past. Maybe it is. But listen to me, everybody. Now, Pa, please. You've got to listen. All of you. I don't belong in this house. Sure you do, Pa. You're the head of the house. The fine head I am. Jim, we've tried hard to make you happy. That's just it. Well, I'm getting out. You hear? I'm getting out. Pa, what do you mean? Where are you going? Pa! I'm getting out of here. I'm going to get a job. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. I'm getting out. Joe? It's taken me months to find out what's wrong with me, and then screw up my courage to come back and talk to you. Well, what's on your mind? Plenty. I want to go to work again. Afraid that's out of the question, Jim. You know what happened a year ago. Sure I know. That's why I came back. Jim, you and I have been friends for years, but I don't see how I can take you back on here Camille. The men might not like it for one thing, keeping up their morale in a serious business. Maybe you think it's been a circus, losing minds and getting it back again. Say, you don't sound like the same Jim Blake. I'm not. Joe, I'm dead serious this time. I want another chance. You've got to listen to me. You've got to. Jim, I'll listen to you, sure. But it's no use. Absolutely no use. I'm sorry. Well, I guess there's no use waiting any longer for your pa. Let's sit down, everybody. Ma, shall I keep pa supper hot in the oven? Yes, I guess so, Rosie. Guess he's sliding back in his old ways again. Quit worrying, Ma. Pa's all right. I've been wondering about that. He's been going on the strangest way the past few weeks. He never says a word. He goes out all day, comes home late, just sits and thinks. Maybe he's sick. Ma, I tell you he's okay. Come on, let's eat. And, Colin, I'm scared, I tell you. He's away all day now, and you won't tell where he goes. Ma, I've been keeping this quiet. I'm going to tell you where pa is every day. Yeah? He goes to the mill. To the mill? Yeah. He goes to the mill every day and camps outside Joe Jacobs' office. Oh, poor Jim. Poor Jim. Race up, Ma. Heck, maybe you think it's easy on me seeing my ma take a beating like that. Going to the mill every day, trying to get a job. But won't Mr. Jacobs see him? I don't know. I used to think Joe was an ace. But I'm beginning to think he's a louse. The least thing he could do would be to tell pa no. Shh. Here he comes now. Let's cheer him up all we can. You're just in time for supper, Jim. Hello, Paul. Hello, Paul. We're keeping your supper warm. Hi there, pa. Sit down. I'll go get your slippers. Oh, hello, everybody. You all right, Paul? Sure. Just had a shot, though. Jim, what's wrong? Take it easy, Paul. Sit down. Take it easy. Not from now on, Howard. What do you mean? Well, I just talked to Joe Jacobson. Listen, pa. Don't let him get your goat. He's only a tough mill boss. Ha ha. He sure is, son. But hey, I'm just beginning to tell you. Joe, Joe finally broke down, and he hired me. What's wrong with this? Jim, you've got a job. Hooray. But, Paul, how did you do it? Well, son, I just stuck like a log jam. Till Joe must have got tired of seeing me around. I told him I'd keep coming back every day till he up and hired me. Paul, you sure have spoke. Son, I've got something a lot better than that. I've got the old fight back again. Mary, it's late. You better come to bed. All right. As soon as I finish this report. What report, Mary? My home project report for Miss Dale. It's due tomorrow. Oh. I'm almost through. See, here at the first, I've outlined my project. Family cooperation. And here I've written down what we've done. And look, Ma. Here's the best part of it where I've written. My father's been back at work now for two months. Mary, you know, it beats all how everything worked out, just like your Miss Dale said it would. And as Miss Dale pointed out, home economics in our schools today means much more than it did in the days when many of us went to school. This program, Watson, a family, is dedicated to the new home economics methods developed by schools with federally aided vocational home economics departments. The program has been produced by the radio department of the National Music Camp as an audition for the United States Office of Education. Script by Florence Seawood.
