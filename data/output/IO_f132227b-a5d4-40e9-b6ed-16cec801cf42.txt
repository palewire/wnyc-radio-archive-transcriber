And what's the occasion? The groundbreaking ceremony of St. Mary's Park Recreation Center. The weatherman's kind of a meanie. He's trying to fill up that pool with water even before Mayor O'Dwyer gets a chance to speed up its construction. We have the honor and the privilege of presenting now at this time one of the greatest men in the way of recreational factors, parks, and the beautifying and the facilities, increasing the facilities of our city. And need I say that our chairman is the honorable Robert Moses, commissioner of the New York City Park Department, who will preside. The first thing on the program is the Star Spangled Banner. U.S. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Your Honor, the Mayor, distinguished officials, and my neighbors in the Bronx. Thank you. First of all, I want His Honor, the Mayor, to know, and Bob Moses to know, that out before them from this platform, they're looking upon the faces of a group of very grateful Bronxites, because we're eternally grateful to His Honor, the Mayor, and to Bob Moses for what they're giving us here this afternoon. Am I right? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now, to you, those of you who do not understand what the program was or what the problems were, I should just like to say this. Many years ago, as a young alderman with black hair in a restricted area in this lower section, I began to struggle for this kind of an operation in our community. It wasn't until 1946 when I found a receptive ear. And that ear was on the head of a man with a great heart. But as great as his heart was and as complete as his desire was to assist the needy in this very needy section of our community, he made it very plain that he had one objective before he would consider anything else. And he said, Keegan, until I'm sure that we have put the hospitals for the sick poor in your community in decent, livable shape, you won't get money for anything. I couldn't back away from that determination because every one of us recognizes that the man or the woman who is handicapped by sickness and on top of that is suffering from poverty was entitled to sleep and rest and recuperate under different conditions and were then facing the inmates of our Bronx Hospital. But late last year, Commissioner Moses, one of the greatest public officials whom I have ever met in many years as a politician and a reporter, saw the picture. And he quietly told me that the hospital picture was good and he knew where we could get the money. So Bob and I buttoned the hold of the mayor and here we are. I think it's up to his honor, the mayor himself, and I'm sure he will when he's presented to you, tell you what the struggle was for this. But as a public official and as a resident of this area, as the official representative of this community, I want to be thrilled and brave and gall- and gall-y enough on your behalf to say to Mr. William O'Dwyer, our mayor, and I hope and I'm certain our next mayor, that we- that we in the lower Bronx will never forget what he is doing for us here this afternoon. He will tell you what it will mean or so will Commissioner Moses or someone else. But my job is as the official representative of this community to pledge our thanks and our support to him for what he's done for us. Thank you. Before I present the mayor, I want to say one thing. In following municipal and state and other campaigns for a number of years, sometimes with a lively personal interest and sometimes just as a fellow that's sort of grinning from the sidelines, I have never seen such a Niagara or bunk poured over the falls as it has come through in some of the campaign speeches. The idea that my old friend, chum Newbold Morris, can do these things the day after he's elected, just by fiat, by printing Mexican money, is the greatest nonsense in the world. These are things take time. They take a lot of courage. Distinctions have to be made, such as those that Charlie Keegan mentioned, between hospitals and playgrounds and schools. They all have adherents. They all have supporters. Some of them are more vociferous than others. Some of them make a better case than others. But when you're all through, there's only a limited amount of money available for these things. And in the last analysis, the choice has to fall upon the head of the city government. He's the fellow who makes the decisions. And to the extent that he carries them out and gets things done, he's the man that you want to have to continue in office. I now present to you, Mayor O'Dwyer. Mr. Moses, Colonel Keegan, Mr. Spargo and Mr. Hotchkiss, the distinguished people who have come here today, to start the ball rolling. Children, you know what we're going to do here today? That's right. We're going to start the digging today. And you know what's going up here right away after we begin? A building. You know what's going to be in that building? A swimming pool, you're right. A swimming and a gymnasium. All right, Red, you got it. What's the other one? Recreation. You're going to have all that you want. Now, you know when you're going to be able to use this? It'll take a little time. Now, you got to be patient. A little later than that. Next, a year from this January, you're going to be swimming in the swimming pool. And it isn't going to cost you anything. You just go in and swim. And you have mother and dad come around too. It's going to be a nice thing, one of the most beautiful things that this city has got. Now, Charlie Keegan started to fight for this. Bob Moses started to fight for this long before anyone else. We're going to have seven more just like this throughout the city and areas where we need them. This one will be yours. Now, isn't it too bad that all you children aren't 21? It is. All right. Okay. Now, it's going to rain and we don't want a long speech. All I hope is this. When you go to church next Sunday, children, will you just say a little prayer for Bob Moses and for Charlie Keegan? And if you have one left, will you say it for me too? All right. Okay. God bless you. I hope you grow up and enjoy it. I hope you'll be healthy, strong women and men. And I hope you'll be a great credit to your families and to everyone that knows you and to those that don't. Good luck. Let's go and dig, huh, shall we? Thank you. Thank you, sir. And now the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, with Commissioner Moses, Colonel Keegan and the distinguished citizenry here of the Bronx, are about to break ground for this record-breaking recreational center here at St. Ann's Avenue and St. Mary's Street. The band of the fire department of the city of New York is furnishing the music here today, and the youngsters have had a grand time. And the mayor is getting ready now to shovel and dig. And there he goes. There's the first shovel full of earth, right into this territory here at the Bronx, opposite St. Joseph's Hospital here. People in the hospital are having quite a time, but all the windows up on the roof there, behind those nets that protect the recreational facilities of the roof there in the hospital, are all crowded with people. And it looks as though every school kid in the Bronx is up here to see where he's going to swim by a year from January. And now the mayor is very busy digging. There Commissioner Moses digs in. Colonel Keegan is digging in. Colonel Keegan is telling Commissioner Moses how to dig. I think that's funny. He's digging that great tunnel to Brooklyn. I think he knows all about it. He's just being naive. The neighbors are having a wonderful time there. There's seven shovels heaving the dirt here. And is that an indication of good luck? However, a little youngster has come over now. And he wants to shake hands with the mayor. Oh, he's burst out crying because everybody's paid too much attention to him. He got scared. Oh, that's me. He tripped over one of the diggings here and sort of lost his balance and it blew off his nervous balance as well. Well, we're just waiting now to see if there's a final word before we say goodbye from the Bronx. These diggers here are very well dressed. They look very prosperous to be digging holes here in the Bronx. However, it means that it... Oh, here's a little red-headed kid walked over and shake hands with the mayor and the mayor grabbed him. He's gonna help the mayor dig now. A red-headed youngster. Now they want all to get in on the act. Little girl there with a red sweater and a pair of blue dungarees. There's a little girl there in a green coat. Now the kids are digging. Oh, that was a nice idea, the mayor. He's gonna let the kids dig it. Well, the pictures have been taken with the officials doing it. Now the kids are digging in. And that's appropriate too, because they're all hepped up about this recreational center. It's gonna be a model for all the recreational centers throughout the city later on. We'll have a wonderful swimming pool indoors at first, and later on as the development is completed, there'll be a tremendous outdoor swimming pool as well. And as Commissioner Moses said, it's a miracle to get the money for these things, and it has to be found, and eventually it is. But it isn't a matter of overnight or an element of weeks or days. It sometimes requires the balancing of many factors of the fiscal budget to get the money necessary to carry out a project of this kind. But if there's any indication of the redhead there that has the mayor by the hand and helping to dig here, the little girl next to him in the red sweater and the blue dungarees, why this swimming pool's gonna work so fast, it's just funny. When you see these pictures in the paper tomorrow, and no, I'm not exaggerating one bit. The tiny little tot over there with a white coat on, and blue dungarees, and an Indian belt around him, and he's had a grand time getting into civics today. Well, that's the idea of civic participation. We have them here now from a few years up, it seems like three or four years old, that little youngster there in the white coat. They're all having a good time, and the cameramen are demanding their innings. I never knew Charlie Keegan knew so much about contracting, but he's doing pretty good. Quite a business-like looking youngster there with a black sweater and blue dungarees, and he's sort of checking up on the whole business, and I suppose planning how he'll run these civic events when he becomes mayor. The microphones of your city station are up here at St. Ann's Avenue and St. Mary's Street, opposite of two hospitals here, St. Anthony's and St. Mary's, across the park there. And the occasion, as we told you before, is the groundbreaking for the recreational center, which will be a great model of its kind for several other recreational centers throughout the city. The mayor is shaking hands now with all the youngsters, and they've certainly had a complete course in civics today. Commissioner Moses outlined the difficulty of the fiscal policy of the city from the standpoint of the real authority of a man who can talk of a thing like that, like Commissioner Moses. And Mayor O'Dwyer has done his part in the digging here today with Colonel Keegan and the neighbors from the Bronx to help, especially the young neighbors and the kids who have done such a wonderful job. And now the mayor's having a little visit with the youngsters, and in just a few minutes we'll be turning the microphones back to the city station, because the weatherman hasn't left us alone one minute. He's been sprinkling this entire party all afternoon with light drizzle, but that hasn't dampened anybody's ardor for the occasion. And we do know the reason why we have the fine specimens of manhood and womanhood in New York City is because of the wonderful facilities, the park facilities, the beaches, the school program, the educational facilities, the gymnasiums in the schools, and the swimming pools. Well, we do know that a great mind and a great brain and a great soul has to have a fine edifice to live in. And that edifice is the human body that receives every facility to develop along with the mind in the development of the youngsters of the city of New York. And when this recreational center is concluded here at St. Ann's Avenue and St. Mary's Street, why, there'll be no apologies to make of any kind because I've seen the plans and it's really very, very interesting. This redhead here has sort of adopted the mayor and I think the mayor's going to have a hard time getting away from him. But he's taking it all in its stride and the poise of these youngsters is really, really something. It's really a remarkable thing to see how closely united they are. And now they've all climbed up there on the hill. They've come over the hill from another section of the Bronx. Where do they all come from? We have a regular amphitheater here. Well, that's about all from the Bronx, I guess, today. We can look forward, as Park Commissioner Moses said, for a year from January when this recreational center will be completed. And as the mayor told the youngster, you'll be swimming around in it a year from January. And so, we take leave of you from St. Ann's Avenue and St. Mary's Street in the borough of the Bronx with the inauguration here of the recreation center that will be a model for several other recreation centers throughout the city for the development of the bodies of our young boys and young girls as a shrine for their minds, their souls, and their development as citizens. Goodbye from the Bronx. It's a wonderful place. And we've enjoyed every moment of our visit here. We return you now to the studios. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
