It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scurney of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. Mayor Vittorio is rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Vittorio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable sindaco di New York, and I have covered opinions I will have heard more of them they've gotliked over my cosplayer and over my noble village I will come here the honor to represent them There are acts and rag сумorious people and each act that um cannot hone very on my opinion But there are some things that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Europe and is coming to my city, she did not have only made a cordial visit to all of us. She also has an homage to the city-mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Genova ambasciadora of democracy. That democracy is so expensive to the United States, but that is so expensive, so expensive to the Italians, especially the Genovese. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, for which every citizen of American, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come she has been able to come to the high level of representative of the city. So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit is the name of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States, and its own mayor, who has had such great success in Genova and Italy. It is also the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic society, and who has contributed to the modest to reconstituir her, and who has contributed to the support of this man and the Italian population, to the great people of the United States, to the great people of the United States, to the great people of the United States, to the United States, to which we are profoundly grateful, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made up to rid ourselves of democratic democratic libertades, when he intervened so potent in the war, and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men also, so that today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently because they defend the democracy in Europe and really in the world. And, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work on, because the democratic democratic democratic freedom are really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do, for sure we, italians, not understand, we should remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is happened right in the moment when we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We have lost the country in the world, we have lost the country in which our work could be exploited, we have lost the misery and the ravine, but the attachment to this force, this democratic democratic was so alive that we have taken our work on, we have worked, we have worked, we have worked, we have worked, we have lived for a living context in 옷ừngceThes different times and현 siinäfind起如果 died in heart NOx We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genova. The tenacious of Colombo in searching your own land is an example to all the genoveses. The result of not credibly, of contrasting every man and the events of every man, this man knew that this great land existed and looked at it desperately. And he went to the river and searched everywhere, looking at the passage he wanted to find for everyone to join the cross. And then, it doesn't matter if he then found the passage, it doesn't matter if each one of us finds the passage. If we persist, others will find the way, the way to find the way, the way to find the way to be free, in peace and in the work. Thank you. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the Mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genova, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us. And we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, see, cause, ah. If the ladies could ask you if you care you'd rather start a love affair, say, cause, you know, ah. Does it mean yes? Oh, no. Does it mean no? Well, yes and no. Cause, see, cause, ah. Get together and sing, cha-la-la-la. It's easy to say, so try today. And I'm ready to sing, cause, ah. Oh, see, cause, ah. Oh, see, cause, ah. Well, the ridges come to town to settle up or settle down. They're in the hay day because it's play day. There's a bottle, a laugh, a joke, a heck of a night, and then they're broke. We know tomorrow, we'll have tomorrow. We'll bring this from school. Have a fine. Our travels in great vacation, they've done good time. We're all pals together. Comrades, birds of a feather. Rootin' pals, scootin' pals, scootin' pals, shootin' pals. In ray of sunshine, pals say they're brother. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. When you hold your own, you're not alone. So when you belong to the Lone Star, Rangers, man's home. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Thank you, Sergeant Dillon and men of the Glee Club.
