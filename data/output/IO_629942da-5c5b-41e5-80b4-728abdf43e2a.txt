Right into the anthem. Brought bright and bright stars through the peril of night. O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

Isquith Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you, Mr. Chairman As a guest for the United Hospital Fund of this great metropolis I wish to tell you that prior to my country's call to active duty I was associated with both municipal and voluntary hospitals in this city For over 20 years I am acquainted with what goes on inside the walls of every hospital Whether military or civilian Both in peacetime and wartime They are the indispensable guardians of every man, woman and child 24 hours a day, every day, year in and year out Having recently returned from the far-flung battle areas of the South Pacific I can tell you innumerable incidents of what a hospital, whether afloat or ashore, means to our fighting forces I also know what it means to those of us who have remained at home Imbued with the confidence and care of available hospital facilities nearby Both the civilian and the fighting men can maintain fully the will to fight and the will to win Our hospitals have trained the doctors and nurses that serve you and serve the men at the fighting front They have sent base units directly to the fighting front And they assure every serviceman that his loved ones shall be given the finest medical care Regardless of race, creed, color, or ability to pay As citizens of our great republic, the support of our hospitals here at home is our patriotic duty Thank you Thank you, Commander Samuel Iscliffe Thank you, Commander Samuel Iscliffe Thank you, Commander Samuel Iscliffe It is now my privilege to introduce Captain Reynolds Hayden The medical officer in charge of Pearl Harbor during the December 7th attack For the past 25 years, Captain Hayden has distinguished himself again and again At Pearl Harbor, his use of sulfonylamide and blood plasma and his prompt and tireless organization of medical aid Saved an almost miraculous number of lives and won the admiration of the entire medical profession And also of the fighting forces I am pleased to present Captain Hayden Thank you, Mr. Paley and Mayor LaGuardia I am honored to be here today Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to bring you a brief report on what the medical services were called upon to do at Pearl Harbor on December 7th Because our hospital was located in the Navy Yard, the jet planes roared over and around us as we were virtually in the bullseye of the target My staff, of whom I am especially proud, thought first of their patients Care for those we already had, in preparation for those whom we knew would soon be coming They diced from their quarters to the hospital through a rain of anti-air shell fragments and stray machine gun bullets All stations were manned and the hospital ready to receive casualties within ten minutes of the time the first plane went over As the casualties began to stream in, a building nearby was set of fire by a burning Japanese plane that fell alongside of it This fire was put out by the hospital force Our first casualty was a man who had been walking along the road beside the hospital with his wife and child His left arm was torn off by a small shell fragment He died shortly after admission to the hospital For three hours, beginning about a half hour after the attack began, we received casualties, an average of three a minute For several days, it was necessary for all hands to work practically 24 hours a day At night, the only light available in the wards is a dim light from blue flashlights The experience taught us much It taught us that no precaution is too unimportant for the eventuality of an air raid It made us realize the desperate need for medical service caused by fighting of this kind It taught us the imperative need for blood plasma Because of our blood bank, we had an unusually low rate of mortality among our seriously burned patients Finally, it proved once again that the training received by our nurses and doctors here at home And the medical equipment we were able to bring into the fight are superior And that this superiority is due in no small part to work and training afforded by our hospitals Thank you Thank you, Captain Hayden And now, ladies and gentlemen, we will hear America, sung by Miss Mary Small, accompanied by the Fort J Band Small My country, tis of thee, sweet land of liberty Land of liberty Of thee I sing Land where my fathers died Land of the pilgrims' pride From every mountainside From every mountainside Let freedom ring Let freedom ring That ends our meeting.

In this very colorful ceremony in front of City Hall today In the presence of the mayor of the city of New York With Mr. William S. Paley, the distinguished head of the networks Presiding as annual chairman for the United Hospitals Week at this time And in the presence of the various citizens who will participate in all five boroughs that comprise this wonder city We've brought you the audible part, we might say, as well as the vocal Miss Mary Small singing the two anthems The audible features of the ceremony, and it is regrettable, of course, that radio is limited and cannot bring you the extremely colorful pageant Which the entire situation presented here in the plaza Various hospital units, all hospitals represented with casualty ambulances, casualty units, nurses Ranging from the time of Florence Nightingale in costume right down to the present day Which in itself shows the great progress it has been made, rather, in the mere matter of attire And the sanitary attire of nurses Miss Nightingale appearing with very much more paraphernalia than a modern nurse naturally would be expected to carry But who did such marvelous work at the period in her life when she opened up the field of nursing to all women And had to stand such frightful criticism as she did by those people who are very often incomprehensible about situations that are so Representative of the scene at the time United Hospitals Week has received the benediction of the mayor of the city of New York In which he asked for your full-hearted cooperation with the extremely good tagline that you can deduct whatever you give to the United Hospitals campaign from your income tax returns And so, with good luck to all the hospitals, one of the greatest activities in a city like New York, we take leave of you from City Hall Plaza This is the Municipal Broadcasting System
