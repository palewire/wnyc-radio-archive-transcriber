Good afternoon. This day, Sunday, September 23rd, has been designated as Interfaith Day by proclamation of Mayor Impeletary and Governor Dewey. And from the mall in Central Park, your city station is about to broadcast the seventh annual observance of Interfaith Day, which is sponsored by the Interfaith Movement Incorporated, Robert A. Carroll President. Interfaith Day was conceived for the purpose of reminding the world that unity can and does exist, regardless of a person's religion, origin, or color. Right here in New York City are persons of many different racial strains, many different religions, who at this moment are giving a living example of how people of diverse origins and beliefs can live in harmony and peace. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the first voice you will hear this afternoon will be that of the Vice Chairman of Interfaith Day, Emil K. Ellis. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and a great pleasure indeed to present to you the Chairman of Interfaith Day, the beloved President of the Board of Education, Maximilian Moss. Maximilian Moss. Maximilian Moss. Maximilian Moss. Maximilian Moss. Maximilian Moss. Maximilian Moss. Maximilian Moss.

And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night And the flag was still there Oh, say does that stuff banged out And day it wave O'er the land of the free And the hope of the brave Let us rise again for the invocation which will be pronounced by the right reverend Monsignor John S. Middleton, Secretary for Education to his eminence, Francis Cardinal Spellman in the Archdiocese of New York. Monsignor, middle.

You see, a singing attorney is quite different from a singing witness, if you know what I mean. I mean. I now have the privilege of presenting the president of the interfaith movement, a well-known community leader. I might say the man most responsible for this program, Mr. Robert Carroll. Reverend members of the clergy, Mr. Chairman, honored guests, and friends of the interfaith movement. Not long ago, a highly placed jurist declared in an opinion that there are no absolutes. In all charity, we must ascribe this grievous error to mundane and muddled thinking. Had he but looked aloft and seen with the eyes of faith the creator who made him, he would have recognized the absolute being. Had he considered beauty, truth, justice, and the charity which is love, he would have arrived at the knowledge of absolutes, which in their perfection are facets of the divine existence. Had he looked upon the fleshy tablets of his own and all men's hearts, he would have seen another absolute, the natural, moral law which God has written thereon, that all his children may be guided in the proper path to their eternal destiny. Man is a creature composed of body and soul, made to the image and likeness of God. God made him to know him, to love him, to serve him in this world, and to be happy with him forever in heaven. On the immortal soul of man, God has bestowed two priceless gifts. An intellect wherewith he may know truth, and which will never be fully satisfied, except in the knowledge of perfect truth, which is God himself. A free will which seeks the possession of goodness, and which will rest only in perfect goodness, which is likewise God himself. Early this month, in a conference at a local university, 125 scholars and observers of public affairs devoted themselves to an analysis of the nature of freedom and authority. According to the New York Times, and I quote, not all agreed the definitions of these two concepts were essential. Those reluctant toward pat definitions tended in general to revert to the approach of Thomas Hobbes, whereby freedom was to be understood primarily in terms of absence of restraint. Close quotation. Hobbes' definition, if put into practice, would logically lead to political, social, economic, and moral anarchy. Freedom is not license. Freedom is the liberty to do the things we should do. Freedom is a God-given right inherent in the nature of man. God has made us not only rational animals, but also moral persons, responsible for our thoughts, words, and deeds. The power to think, to know, and to judge the rightness or the wrongness of human acts has not been altered in any essential respect within the span of human history. Freedom of speech, freedom to earn a decent living, freedom to worship God, freedom to worship God, freedom from fear and oppression are from God and are guaranteed by our glorious Constitution, whose authors were moral and God-loving men. God, in whom all authority resides, has in his loving providence promulgated his moral law for men through the light of human reason. Unless there be any confusion along the way of life, he has made that law explicit in the Ten Commandments which he gave us through the medium of the saintly leader, Moses. These commandments he has summed up in two. The love of God who loves us with an infinite love, and the love of our fellow man because of our love for God and because he is beloved by God. The virtue of charity is love, and love is the fulfilling of the law. We of interfaith seek to promote mutual respect, understanding, and cooperation between people of goodwill, irrespective of faith, race, or color. Peace can come only to men of goodwill, and goodwill in men can be inspired only by the divine virtue of charity. And so we endeavor to be charitable in thought, word and deed, loving God and loving our fellow man, that all may dwell in peace and harmony, enjoying the freedom that is the essence of our American way of life. There can be no external peace without internal peace. May peace reside within the soul of every American, that he may live in unanimity and charity with his fellow man, making our country a leaven of love that will restore the world to the freedom and peace of our loving maker. Everything worthwhile, everything that endures, must have a foundation, a background and a spirit that is forceful and productive. I have given you the foundation of the interfaith movement. It is based on the eternal truths and the spiritual nature of man. The background of the interfaith movement is the relationship of man to God as his son. The spirit of the interfaith movement is charity, and the products of that spirit are the mutual respect and understanding which we will ever endeavor to inculcate in the hearts of all of our citizens, so that all may be united in a cooperative and patriotic striving for the common good of our beloved country. You are listening to the Interfaith Day Ceremonies on WNYC AM and FM New York. For reading of the scriptures, we shall be privileged to have one of our most distinguished ministers, Dr. Channon H. Tobias. Will you rise, please? Here beginneth the thirteenth chapter of 1 Corinthians. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am nothing. Though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind. Charity envieth not. Charity vaunteth not itself. Charity is not puffed up. Charity is not puffed up. Charity does not behave itself unseemly. Charity seeketh not her own. Charity is not easily provoked. Thinketh no evil Rejoiceth not in iniquity But rejoiceth in the truth Beareth all things Believeth all things Hopeth all things Endureth all things Charity never faileth But whether there be prophecies They shall fail Whether there be tongues They shall cease Whether there be knowledge It shall vanish away For we know in part And we prophesy in part But when that which is perfect is come Then that which is in part Shall be done away When I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child But when I became a man I put away childish things For now we see through a glass darkly But then face to face Now I know in part But then shall I know Even as also I am known And now abideth Faith, hope, charity These three But the greatest of these Is charity Whenever men meet for good works And good deeds You will find the next speaker Our warm friend Not for the day But for many years In the interfaith movement One of our hardest working directors The Honorable Joseph T. Sharkey Acting Mayor of the city of New York Sharkey Mr. Moss Reverend Claygy Distinguished guests And fellow New Yorkers It is a heartening sight To see so many citizens of this great city And so many children gathered here On the Central Park Mall To commemorate Interfaith Day A day set aside By proclamation of the governor And the mayor of the city As an opportunity to reaffirm And give living expression and example To the great ideals of equality and brotherhood Which are an integral part of our democracy This great city is composed Of almost 8 million people Whose families have come from every country in the world Here in this metropolis Is represented every racial strain Every religious group Every color Every creed A more diverse population Could not possibly be imagined To these shores They have brought all the culture The folklore The habits And even the prejudices Of the old world But it did not take long for them To learn that in this country And particularly in this city There are no classes There are no superior races There are no groups Entitled to special favors In the eyes of society or the law That the American ideal of brotherhood Is the common denominator That binds us together And fuses us into a new race A race of Americans Who believe in the dignity And waste of the human being Who bring with them The cultures of the old world But discard its prejudices In favor of the ideals Of freedom and democracy Of the new world What better example and proof Can we give to the world Than the unity and friendship That exists in this city Between peoples of so many races Origins and religious beliefs What greater inspiration Can we give to the whole human race Than the demonstration Of how our people live Peacefully and harmoniously together This city is noted As a religious center Within its boundaries Are thousands of Catholic churches Protestant churches And Jewish synagogues And hundreds of other temples Of religion Here they function openly Under a government Which allows free And full exercise Of religious worship Here there is no domination Or control of religions By any government Or group of individuals Here the cardinal rule Of love of our fellow man Is not merely a theory But a fact The essence of our strength Is the respect Which each man has For the dignity And weight of his neighbor As a human being Entitled to his own beliefs And habits Without pressure Or hatred From those among whom He lives Let us not delude ourselves By any belief That the unity of our people Is not under constant attack By the merchants of hatred Bigotry And disunity We must be ever late To meet these Treasonable assaults On our ideals And liberties Our greatest armor Against these preachers Of venom Is the ideal of brotherhood And interfaith Which we are paying respect to On this mall today I congratulate the interfaith movement And the various borough groups Of interfaith Who labor day in and day out Not alone on this day But every day To promote goodwill Friendship And understanding Among our people The program here today Should be an inspiration To all To make interfaith intolerance A daily habit To resist prejudice And tolerance Wherever it rises And strike it down In the name of all That is decent And fair And American The representatives Of the United Nations In this city Might well give careful heed To the lessons And ideals Which we are teaching Here today There is no reason Why nations Of different cultures Habits And creeds Cannot live in peace Friendship And understanding With each other Just as their own people Live in friendship And goodwill In this country Until nations Lay in this lesson There can never be Any permanent peace For peace Can be founded Only upon justice And brotherhood And when this ideal Is achieved By the nations Of the world Then the brotherhood Of man Will reach From the mountaintops To the gray sea sands And the world Will be better I pray Thank

all faiths, it was only appropriate that for the next part of this program, I call upon our Deputy Mayor, the Honorable Charles Horowitz. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege to now read to you the Interfaith Oath. I will discriminate against no man by reason of his faith or creed. I will daily deal with every man in business and social and political relations only on the basis of his true individual worth. I will never try to indict a whole people by reason of the derelictions of any individual. I will utter no rumor and no slander against any saint. I will consecrate myself hour by hour and day by day to the achievement in fact of the highest ideals of the dignity of man, human equality, human fellowship, and human brotherhood. I will never try to indict a whole person, but I will never try to indict a whole person. The next rendition will be by Miss Joan Francis of the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company. Miss Frances.
