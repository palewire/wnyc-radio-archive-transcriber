Young American Artists. This is the high fidelity voice of New York City, WNYC FM. Presenting Young American Artists. Each Sunday afternoon at this time, your city station offers a studio recital featuring young American artists who will be our future concert stars. This afternoon we present the Youth String Quartet. This quartet is trained and sponsored by Blanche Schwartz Levy, chairman of the Chamber Music Division of the New York State Federation of Music Clubs. The quartet has made successful appearances in Carl Fisher Concert Hall, has played under the sponsorship of the Yonkers Philharmonic Society, and has presented recitals at the Museum of the City of New York. The members of the Youth String Quartet are Abraham Kaufman and Erwin Paskin, violins, Isaac Kaufman, viola, and Marjorie Borgia, cello. For today's recital, they have chosen Mozart's string quartet in B-flat major, Kirschow 458. This work consists of four movements, Allegro Vivace Assai, Minuetto, Adagio, and Allegro Assai. Now, the string quartet in B-flat major by Mozart.
