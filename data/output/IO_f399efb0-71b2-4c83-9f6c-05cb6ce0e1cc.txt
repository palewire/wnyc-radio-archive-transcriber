The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gaspary. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Skerney of Genoa during his visit here to scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished for so distinguished a visitor. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy, but throughout the world, expressed to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor, Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it's with profound commotion that I've heard your words affectionate and cordiales revolting to my modest person and revolting to the noble city that I have here the honor of represent. There are some facts and acts that are made of men and every act that man has a own meaning but there are some acts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Honorable Impeleteri, is come to Europe and is come to my city, she has not completed only a visit of cordiality that is a great way to all of us. She has also made a homage to the city of the mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to you with recognition of the people of the world so connected to the land of America. But she, Honorable Impeleteri, is come to Genoa ambasciadora of democracy. Of that democracy that is so expensive to the people of the United States but that is so expensive to the people of the United States and to the people of the United States above all. For this, Honorable Impeleteri, we are grateful for her because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States and so every citizen of America, independent of its origin and of its social class, can come she has been to the people of the country as she has been to the people of the United States and the people of the United States so this my visit is not just a response not just a response to the people of the United States Honorable Impeleteri this my visit is a salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo the city of the United States and his own nation that has had so great success in Genoa and in Italy it is a salute to the people of the United States and the United States of the United States, the United States, which we are deeply grateful, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made for us to give us democratic libertarian when we have intervened so potent in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men also, so today we can say that the United States have assumed in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently because defending democracy in Europe is really defending it in the world. Ebbene, onorevole Imperiteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, è con questa fede che noi lavoriamo, perché le libertà democratiche siano veramente estese a tutto il mondo e vi sia pace e lavoro per tutti. Non è facile il nostro compito. Forse talvolta noi italiani non siamo compresi. Bisogna ricordare che la ricostruzione della democrazia in Italia è avvenuta proprio nel momento in cui noi eravamo gravati dal peso della sconfitta. Città care avevamo perduto, territori nei quali il nostro lavoro poteva espletarsi, miserie e rovine, ma l'attaccamento a questa forza, l'attaccamento a questa fede democratica era così vivo che noi abbiamo ripreso il nostro lavoro. Abbiamo lavorato, lavoriamo, disperatamente lavoriamo per ricostruire moralmente e materialmente il nostro Paese. È con questi sentimenti, onorevole Imperiteri, che io saluto lei e la città di New York e le dico che siamo tenaci nell'opera di ricostruzione della democrazia nel nostro Paese. Siamo tenaci e abbiamo degli esempi. Abbiamo degli esempi soprattutto a Genova. La tenacia di Colombo nel ricercare la vostra terra è un esempio a tutti i genovesi. Deriso, non creduto, contrastato da ogni avversità, dagli uomini e dagli avvenimenti, quest'uomo sapeva che questa grande terra esisteva e l'ha cercata disperatamente, è andato assondando alle foci dei fiumi, è andato cercando negli estuari, ovunque, cercando quel passaggio che lui voleva trovare per congiungere tutto il mondo sotto la croce cristiana. Ebbene, non importa se lui poi non ha trovato il passaggio, non importa se ognuno di noi non trova il passaggio, bisogna persistere altri, troverà la strada, la strada perché tutto il mondo sia libero in pace e nel lavoro. Applausi Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit not only visit the city of Columbus but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. Mr. Pavia You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which mean so much to us and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities which is with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe that in spite of all difficulties we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen.

These funny little words don't really mean a thing, it's just a phrase that nowadays Italians love to sing. Oh, si, oh, tra-la-la, it's a wonderful word, la-la-la-la, if anyone asks you how you are, it's proper to sing.
