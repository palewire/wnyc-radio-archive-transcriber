The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay Alone löve it, their ages, I have to stop there I am near at the front to fight the foe. Give us, soldier boys, a marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling, goodbye, darling, pray. Come on, now, south, way, way, down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song, jump on, it won't be long. We're on our way, hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, hooray. And since makes the heart grow thunder, ooh. That is why I long for you. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I've hungered, wondering, darling, is your true. Distance only lands and shone lands. Though the ocean waves divide, Absence makes the heart grow thunder, Longing to be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother, just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, yes, she is here, right, she is here. When the sun gets flowers, you need to die so free. He's died so free. You will see the word you say, that's the time we too shall wear. When the harvest days are over, yes, she is here, my, yes, she is. And the harvest days are over, yes, she is here, my, yes, she is. And the harvest days are over, yes, she is to leave the test days. And the harvest days are over, yes, she is back in 18세. And the harvest days are over, yes, we have been out, of our dayse! And the harvest days are over, yes, we have been out. So I may not have had a dayes for the harvest days. The love is a dream he adored as the band played on. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded. The poor girl would shake me along. He derries a dream with a ball-earing ground as the band played on. Sweet Adeline, my Adeline, at night, dear heart, for you I find. In all my dreams, your fair-faced be. In all my dreams, your heavenly dreams. You're the flower of my heart. Sweet Adeline, my heart, we love. Sweet Adeline, my heart, we love. He's only a man in a fearless day. A beautiful sight to hear. You may think he's happy and free from care. He's not a voice he seems to be. He's done when you think of a wasted life. For you cannot make me wait. And her beauty was sold for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a gilded way. A little brown car, a shady green spot. So happier home I find. My heart's barely gone, I love only one. She's the girl I have to be mine. She's the girl I have to be mine. Just one girl, only just one girl. Where are all the kind of a man's life are? The more rain she is just one day. I'll be happy forever with just one girl. I'll be happy forever with just one girl. OK, I'm Holmes. 알시 J. attack й The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The Christian days Come to her home we go All of white and all of them They love and show The way he's done it As I did through I know Here's the first night of paradise party Two little girls in blue, lad Two little girls in blue They were sisters, we were brothers And learned to love her too And one little girl in blue, lad Who won your father's car Became your mother I married the other But we have ripped it apart She was bred in old Kentucky Where the meadow grass is blue There's the sunshine of the country In her face and manner too She was bred in old Kentucky Take her boy, you're mighty lucky When you marry a girl like you Come, man, man, man Ever since we were boys Sharing each other's sorrows Sharing each other's joy Come, man, man, man When man was born They knew all their life was joined When danger's reddish, my darling old comrade, was there by my side.
