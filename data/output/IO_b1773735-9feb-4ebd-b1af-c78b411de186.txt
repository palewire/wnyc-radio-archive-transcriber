Guy Lombardo and the sweetest music this side of heaven. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's Guy Lombardo and his orchestra in a special program featuring Guy's own arrangement of that popular novelty with a hey and a hi and a ho ho ho. But first, Guy has something to say to you. I just want to take a moment to say that the boys and I are very happy to be able to offer this special little program. We feel it's part of our contribution to a mighty worthy cause. The American Cancer Society is striving toward that all-important goal of controlling cancer through its programs of education, service, and research. You know, I was very surprised to learn that cancer will kill 188,000 Americans this year alone. They tell me no one is safe from cancer. Now it seems to me we all should think of this fight against cancer as a very personal thing and get into it. The best way we can do our part is by making generous contributions to the American Cancer Society. In that way, we'll be helping as much as we possibly can. We must help because cancer must be controlled. Make your contribution today and make it more than before. And now, Guy Lombardo and his orchestra with a hey and a hi and a ho ho ho. Ho ho ho! With a hey and a hi and a ho ho ho, you start off the day with a glow ho ho. Sing all the way as the way you go with a hey and a hi and a ho ho ho. Up go the blinds and you know ho ho, it ain't gonna rain anymore ho ho. Sun's gotta shine cause you made it so with a hey and a hi and a ho ho ho. While you buy the paper, hum a little happy little hum. Cut a little caper, singin' happiness here I come. With a hey, hi, ho ho ho, you smile from your head to your toe ho ho. Pack up your blues and away they go. With a hey and a hi and a hey and a hi and a hey and a hi and a ho ho. With a hey and a hi and a ho ho ho. With a hay and a high and a hay and a high and a hay and a high and a ho ho. This is Ed Hurley speaking. The American Cancer Society says that every three minutes, someone dies of cancer.

I'd like to take just a few seconds to remind our friends that this month is Cancer Control Month. It's the time when all of us should pitch in and do our share in the fight against cancer. We've got to do it, because the American Cancer Society tells me even though a great amount is being done to control it, the death rate from cancer is still going up. Now, folks, you know by now that anyone can get cancer. So that makes it squarely up to you and me, every one of us, to see that this vicious killer is brought under control. It can be done through the programs of education, service, and research carried on by the American Cancer Society. Let's hurry along that day when we'll be freed from the threat of death from cancer. Give the American Cancer Society your generous financial support. Do it today. And now, Oh, Looker There Ain't She Pretty. Oh, Looker There Ain't She Pretty.

G애agtwaselly The End Ladies and gentlemen, here is that sentimental gentleman of swing, Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra, in a special program designed for your enjoyment. And here is Tommy himself with a word for you. Friends, this is Cancer Control Month. Now that's a rather formal-sounding name, but what it means to you and me is simply this. It's the time when we can doff our hats to the American Cancer Society for the swell job it's doing, and it's our chance to help in its important work. You know, throughout the year, the American Cancer Society is fighting that terrible killer cancer on three fronts. Education, service, and research. It's a hard, slow process, this business of gaining control over cancer, but it must be done. Every one of us has to help the society because it's for us, you and me, not the other fellow, that is doing all those things. Right now, while you're listening to us, sit down and take care of that contribution. There's an awful lot of work to be done, and it's mighty expensive. Suppose you give more than before this time.

The End Frankie Carl, his piano and his orchestra, with a special arrangement of Penguin at the Waldorf. But first, here's Frankie. I just want to take a couple of seconds here to say that the other day, I really got set back on my heels. I was told by someone who works at the American Cancer Society that unless we do something about it, 17 million of us Americans now living will die of cancer. How's that for something to think about? Pretty dismal, isn't it? But you know we can and should do more than just think about it. We can help the American Cancer Society fight this thing until it's beaten. And it can be done, too. There's nothing we can't do if we really put our shoulders to the wheel. Now, I want to ask all you good people listening to help the American Cancer Society in fighting cancer. You can do it by contributing the money which must be raised so the society can carry on its programs of education, research, and service. Give today, and this time really give. And now, Penguin at the Waldorf. Wen Hank Hall rock, drive, droveapan it, and it's a동enian or nasty car. Give today,遊zenny or nobody needs a square. So letter,遊zenny or frank char north to the kwestia the word 그러니까 to the AT& White ini, and for your friends!

It's music in the Morgan Manor. Yes, it's Russ Morgan and his orchestra with a new version of that old favorite, I'm looking over a four-leaf clover. But first, here is Russ Morgan. Thanks. You know, I just learned something today, something I didn't know before about cancer. It's made me feel better about the whole thing. The American Cancer Society says that many types of cancer can be cured if they are caught in time. Did you know that? There's a lot we should know about cancer, but we don't. They're the things which can help save lives. We've got to learn these facts, and that's why the educational program of the American Cancer Society is so important. All the work the society does is important to us. Now, in order to be able to carry on, the American Cancer Society needs our financial support. We've got to see that this money is made available. Anyone can get cancer. That means you and me. So, you and I have got to help fight it. Give as much as you can today. And now, here is Russ Morgan's special arrangement of I'm Looking Over a Four-Leaf Clover. I'm Looking Over a Four-Leaf Clover. A Four-Leaf Clover that I overlooked before. One leaf is sunshine, the second is rain. Third is the roses that grow in the lane. No need explaining. The one remaining is somebody I adore.
