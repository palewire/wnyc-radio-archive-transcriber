The choristers of the Department of Welfare, under the direction of Florence Martirosian, offer The Heavens Are Telling, from the creation by Joseph Hayden, as arranged by Charles Phillips. The glory of God. The wonder of His birth, His praise of firm on end. The wonder of His birth, His praise of firm on end. The day that is coming, this is the day. The night that is gone, the following night. The night that is gone, the following night. The heavens are telling, the glory of God. The wonder of His birth, His praise of firm on end. The wonder of His birth, His praise of firm on end. The wonder of His birth, His birth, His birth, His birth. Oh To the own soul The The glory of God The wonder of his word The wonder of his way He'll say the word again The wonder of his word The wonder of his word The wonder of his word The wonder of his word The wonder of his word The wonder of his word h The wonder of His word, His praise, His praise, the fair of death. The heavens forbear in the glory of God. The wonder of His word, His praise, the fair of death. The wonder of His word, His praise, His praise, the fair of death. The wonder of His word, His praise, the fair of death. The wonder of His word, His praise, the fair of death. The wonder of His word, His praise, the fair of death. The wonder of His praise, the fair of death. The wonder of His praise, the fair of death. The wonder of His praise, the fair of death. That was The Heavens Are Telling from The Creation by Joseph Hayden. And now we hear the choristers in a Missouri folk song, The Death Old Woman by Catherine The Heavens Are Telling of the Dead. The Heavens Are Telling of the Dead. The Heavens Are Telling ofah Pierce ... Old woman, old woman, dear to my watching. See the little others, sir, I'm very hot appearing. See the little others, sir, I'm very hot appearing. Old woman, old woman, dear to my watching. Old woman, old woman, dear to my watching. See the little louder, sir, I'm very hot appearing. See the little louder, sir, I'm very hot appearing. Old woman, old woman, dear to my watching. Old woman, old woman, dear to my watching. See the little louder, sir, I'm very hot appearing. See the little louder, sir, I'm very hot appearing. See the little bit more, sir, I'm very hot coming. Looks like this little dramatic musical. Are you happy about the moment you're adesso you're so alive? Are you..… You've just heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare singing The Deaf Old Woman by Katherine Davis.

And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Bore, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I got no car, got no mule, got no misery. The coast is plenty of plenty, got a lot on the door. I got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty of nothing. What for? What for? What for? I got a lot on the door. That's the way to be. They can steal the drugs from the floor. That's okay to be. For the things that are tied, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got my gal, got my tongue, and the head is a whole day long. Do you complainant? I got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my dog. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got the sun, got the moon, and the people see. The coast with plenty of plenty, got to pray all the day. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got plenty of nothing, and I'm worried I keep the devil away. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got plenty of nothing, and I got plenty of nothing. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got my gal, got my tongue, and the head is a whole day long. Do you complainant? I got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Beth. The choristers are under the direction of Florence Martirosian, with Isabelle LeBori as piano accompanist. Yes, I think he archives! He just kinda took away many 1970s a time. Even the mic on theол vouchers is unhealed to a particular apartment. That's really good. We have plenty of living unto these sections. & we have had plenty of hours and desercions, that you put into them at the고요. We'll always follow the past. Or through the fairорт section, but the cortices is done. I think we read the clues as he sees the sign of Madison Martirosian, a a very clever passage of Champagne Celticym.
