The Northwestern University Reviewing Stand. Are we drifting towards socialism? We're not only drifting, we're floating just the way one would float down the Niagara River. And if you can listen attentively, you may hear the sound of falling water ahead. Uh, Mr. Byfield is mistaken in the sound that he hears. That's the sound produced by an eddy when progress of the people meets the dam set up by reactionary forces. We're not drifting, we're going backwards. Northwestern University, in cooperation with the Mutual Broadcasting System, presents the Reviewing Stand, a program in its 16th year on the air. Today, on transcription from WOR New York, the Reviewing Stand takes a close look at our economic and political system and the proposed legislation that may modify it. Our unrehearsed give and take discussion will center around the frequently made charge that we are today in the throes of a creeping socialism. Now, our moderator, Leighton Boren, Director of the Reviewing Stand, will introduce participants in today's discussion. Mr. Boren. Stateism, creeping socialism, the welfare state, controlism. These phrases have emerged from the current speculation about the direction our political policies are taking. To discuss these trends, the Reviewing Stand welcomes Charles M. LaFollette, National Director of Americans for Democratic Action, and Robert S. Byfield, member of the New York Stock Exchange, who has served as a director of several businesses and has written extensively for financial and business publications. Mr. Byfield, you said, we're floating toward socialism. What do you mean, we're floating toward socialism? It's coming upon us gradually and perhaps to some extent unawares. I'd like to change my metaphor a little bit and tell you that, in my opinion, socialism is coming to America through subsidy, subterfuge and slogans. Specifically, socialism is coming to us because the government, the federal government, first of all through management and manipulation of the currency, and it's got larger and larger powers in that direction, has usurped private banking functions. So much so that Mariner Eccles has stated recently that the Federal Reserve Board has become an engine of inflation. Now, one of the major controls of economic power, and this has been a pattern in almost every European country which has drifted or rushed or floated toward socialism, has been that the federal government, the central government, has strengthened and increased its powers over the banking system. Now, we've done that in a myriad of fashions. The federal government has virtual control of the lending and portfolio policies of about 15,000 commercial banks. Now, in the second place, so far as slogans are concerned, one of the methods by which socialism is coming to us is the vilification, by those who would have socialism come, of businessmen who stand between them and the achievement of their objectives. The vilification of all people who oppose the grasp for power, particularly businessmen. And in doing that, they've twisted and distorted the meaning of words and phrases so as to confuse and distort the issue. In the third place, socialism has been creeping up on us, and we've been going towards it, because there has been a steady undermining of the independence of the American farmer by subsidy and controls. Perhaps the peak of that type of legislation is the Brannan Plan, which according to Mr. Alan Klein, head of the American Farm Bureau Federation, is an ideal way to achieve complete control of the farmer. He said that if he wanted control, he'd use that method. And when the time came, the farmer would do as he was told, or he would fold up for lack of a government check. In the fourth place, we're approaching socialism because we've made labor organization almost compulsory, and then we have given union leaders very autocratic powers without forcing equally large responsibilities for their conduct upon them. In the fifth place, we've constantly increased the controls and shackles of private business so as to center the power over private enterprise in the federal government. Almost every day you have evidence of that. As we're sitting here, there's an inquiry or an investigation or whatever it's called going on. In Washington, to find out whether or not the steel industry has certain aspects of a public utility, and if the government does what it looks as though it wants to do, there will be increasing legislation along that point of view. Now, in the next place, there has been a steady undermining of the tradition of American individualism by making as many people as possible dependent on government benefits. It makes them look to Washington. They get in the habit of doing it. They believe that that's where their standard of living lies. They believe that it's the government that accomplishes that. Furthermore, we've weakened the federated system by reducing the area of state sovereignty and substituted for it a greater and greater centralized power in the White House and the executive part of the government. Furthermore, we're promoting inflation by continuous deficit financing, which will eventually contribute to rising prices and thereby popularize greater controls. Look at the Spence Bill. Look at the Economic Adjustment Act, Senate Bill number 281. And there you've got the whole blueprint and pattern for control of American industry. And finally, you've steadily debilitated capitalism by confiscatory taxation, which makes it difficult for savings to flow into industry. It makes it difficult for private individuals to own businesses, and then the government will naturally have to step in. Mr. Byfield, that was an explosive nine-point yes to our question. Are we drifting toward socialism? Now we turn to Charles M. La Follette, former congressman from Indiana, and at present National Director of Americans for Democratic Action. What is your answer to this question, Mr. La Follette? I don't care for the wording of the title of this discussion. Are we drifting toward socialism? Because it's a sort of have you stop beating your wife question. If I answer the question, no, we are not drifting toward socialism, then a clever opponent would interpret that to mean that America is rushing headlong toward socialism. But I shall answer the question anyway. We are not drifting toward socialism. We are not headed for socialism. We do not have socialism. And those who shout the loudest about the so-called socialist threat know that this answer of mine is true. Socialism is defined by all classical economists, that is, conservative economists, as government ownership of the major means of production and distribution. Neither the fair deal nor the new deal are socialistic under this standard. Finally, if we are to assume that the new deal and the fair deal are socialism, which they are not, then we have had precious little socialism in the last ten years. From 1939, the date of the first minimum wage law, until Franklin D. Roosevelt's death, not a single one of the major domestic planks of the new deal was enacted. Harry Truman has succeeded in passing only one, the low-income public housing law, which Senator Taft supported, and which scraped through the House by one vote. Someone may wish to include the rise in the minimum wage from 40 to 75 cents an hour. But I can't consider it as a real advance, because the same bill removed at least 500,000 workers from the provisions of the old law. So the record proves that we have not seen an advance of the fair deal program, beyond the blockades set up by that favorite of the reactionary scaremongers, Senator Robert A. Taft. If we have drifted towards socialism, which we have not, then it has been only with Mr. Taft's consent. But the truth is that there has been no drift, only the backwater from the dam of entrenched reaction. The connotation of the word drift is that of irresistibly being carried into a fearful unknown by a mysterious force over which there is no control. Actually, we Americans don't drift towards anything. We go forward or backward, making choice in the voting booth to support administrations or defeat them. We will remain free, unless we are stampeded into a state of hysteria and persuaded to give up our freedoms. No, we are not drifting towards socialism. Socialism is just the newest of the campaign slogans the reactionaries have devised to scare the voters. Before now, the words were welfare state, regimentation, and so forth. But the voters have gone on supporting the New Deal and the Fair Deal. Naturally, in this set of circumstances, the opponents have to devise a new slogan each time they lose an election. I predict, however, that the voters will continue to support welfare programs so long as they are not confused and divided by the extremists of the far right and the far left. There is evidence already that certain groups and individuals are using economic coercion, social ostracism, and character assassination to steer us into thought control and rigid conformity. Among these are Mr. John T. Flynn, author of The Road Ahead, which reactionary groups are flooding the country. The Committee for Constitutional Government. The Constitutional Education League of Joe Camp. The National Association of Manufacturers. The American Medical Association. And the hatchet men for these big industrialists. I think I can prove these charges before this broadcast has ended. If I have a minute, I might say now that the control over banks was instituted with the Federal Reserve System in 1913. And I can show Mr. Byfield, when the time comes, that it was then called socialism by the banking interest of the country. And I'm also able to, would be able to show to him that in the administration of William Howard Taft, it was said that we were drifting towards socialism, which was in 1910. Well, now, of course, there have been a great many laws get on the statute books with regard to banking since the days of William Howard Taft. And one of them is that at any time, the Treasury can sell five billions of bonds right to the Federal Reserve System. That's something that didn't exist at that time. And that's something which I think would have staggered people in those days. But I'm, I'm interested in something that you say particularly, Mr. La Follette, you used a number of times the word reactionary. Now that brings up, that emphasizes what I said before about drifting towards socialism via slogans. And I think the use of the word reactionary is a slogan. Now that means a lot of things to lots of people. When I was in Berlin last summer, General Kotakov, who was in charge of the Berlin sector, the Russian sector, told General Howley that his definition and that of anybody in Russia, of a reactionary, was anybody who didn't, who wasn't a communist, who didn't go along with it. Now I think that we've twisted the definition of that word reactionary to mean that anybody who doesn't go along with any economic theory or any legislative program that happens to be popular at the moment, they call him a reactionary. And I think it's become meaningless. You think we need another word there, Byfield? I don't know. I don't know what the word is. Perhaps it's progressive. But of course they've taken the word progressive and they've twisted that too. Progressive means to go along with those ideas that happen to be on the up and up and to be against those ideas that happen to be going down. Well, I have another complaint about progressive being of the La Follette clan. They took the La Follette word and gave it to Henry Wallace. And now I can't even use it without arousing all the Senator McCarthys and the other hysteria raisers in the country. But since you want to raise the question of slogans, I'm glad you raised it. Because I want to talk here today about the plan for action devised by the American Manufacturers Association to put all people in this country, in my opinion, rapidly into a straitjacket of thinking, which is done by social ostracism, economic coercion, and making people believe that anyone who thinks that we might examine our economy or examine our social mores or our racial mores, is un-American and therefore that we're not in favor of the American way of life. Just one minute and then I'll give him plenty of time. There's a thing in Anderson, Indiana called the American Guard, financed by General Motors, in my opinion. Certainly every executive of Delco Ramey is an officer of it. The head of that is a man named Harbo who openly equates socialism and communism and says they're both un-American and who is trying to drive the Urban League out because it stands for an intelligent standard on race relations and who has made the position of the YWCA in that community one of jeopardy because it has an open policy on race relations. Talk about slogans. The powers are all in the hands of the people who have the money when it comes to slogans. I'm glad you brought up the point about thought control because when these things happen that you are telling about, and I know nothing about them because I simply haven't the information. If private industry or private groups practice these things, it's intolerable and it's indefensible, and I go along with you. But when the government does it, it's not indefensible, it's tyranny. And I'll show you something which is part and parcel of the so-called welfare state. I'm going to read you from the text of Senate Bill 1645. What bill is that? That's the bill establishing the CVA, which has certainly had the approval of the people who want to expand the government into the electric power business. I don't know whether they're liberals or neoliberals, but I'd like to read you one of the sections. Section 4, subdivision E, it says in the creation of the Columbia Valley Authority that all members of the board shall be persons who profess a belief in the feasibility and wisdom of this act. If that isn't thought control, I've never heard of it. And I've been in Germany, I've been in Russia, I've been in Italy, and that is an intolerable invasion of the individualism of the American people. Well, if that's thought control, it seems to me that it's no more thought control than the attitude and actions of General Motors or any corporation that I know who insist that they will advance to their directorate and put in their executive position people who are interested in their purposes and their objectives as industrialists, which they have a privilege to do. It seems to me that it's not thought control to say that people who shall administer a Valley Authority on the type of TVA should be people who have a belief that it's possible to administer such an authority. That isn't thought control in any shape or form. It is a statement of a very practical standard which business exercises at all times, and I believe you'll agree with it. Now let me get this straight, Mr. Byfield. You say that the TVA or the CVA is socialistic because it has a certain type of thought control. Is that what you're saying? Well, that's only one aspect. That's a hidden aspect. As long as you mention the TVA and I didn't bring it up, I mentioned the CVA, I think that that is the outstanding example of socialism. And I don't, you don't need to take my word for it. That's exactly what Norman Thomas has said recently. And he ought to know what socialism is. Incidentally, I talked to Mr. Thomas recently and he said my work is done. Social welfare and socialism, well, they're synonymous. He said that over the radio. And he's very much pleased because he doesn't think there's much left for him to do. But there's one more thing. I'd like to go back to this, CVA. Besides this thought control, and I don't see eye to eye with Mr. LaFollette on that, they go farther than that. In another clause, it shows that the CVA directors can decide whether you can farm 10 acres, 20 acres, or 160 acres. And if you don't do what they tell you to do, you don't get any water. And if you know what that means out in the Northwest, that's pretty bad. That is socialism par excellence. That's regional authority. And that CVA, incidentally, is opposed by the people in the Pacific Northwest. And they call the people who come from Washington to propagate that a lot of carpetbaggers. They've got tougher words out there than we have down here in the East. Uh, I'm glad that I, we have a fair share of answering that. Uh, the thing that I want to point out to you, I don't know the provisions of the CVA Act, and don't profess to any more, I'd ask you to know the provisions of a great many others. Terry Roosevelt put in the limitation on receiving water for irrigation at 160 acres, and that's one of the great fights in the Central Valley of California today, based on the proposition that you shall not let industrial farming take over all the benefits that arise out of the expenditures of public funds and the public interest that we need to preserve the family-sized farms. So if that was socialism, then it goes back to Teddy Roosevelt's socialism, with reference to the TVA. All I know about the TVA is that the incomes per capita in the Tennessee Valley has increased from $148 in 1933 to $797 in 1947. That individual enterprise has expanded repeatedly under the TVA, and that is, if I know anything about it, the people of the TVA probably made the same kind of statements that you say the people of the Columbia Valley are making today. Today you couldn't get a candidate elected for township trustee in the whole Tennessee Valley who opposed the TVA. Now, it's a progress, it's an acceptance, it's the difference between people being frightened off of things and actuality. Well, I'm glad that you mentioned that about the TVA. Now, of course, there's been a gain in income and other aspects of the standard of living in Tennessee, but there's been an equally large gain in some of those other southern and southwestern states. You can't say that Tennessee has a monopoly of that. And furthermore, why shouldn't those people down in the Tennessee Valley love the TVA? That's the insidious part of socialism. It buys people because they're getting subsidized power. Mind you, they're not getting cheap power. I don't think there is any such thing as cheap government power. It's subsidized power. Taking money from the people in New York and Vermont and California and giving those people down there power below economic cost. I think we've reached an impasse here on the TVA. No, I want to answer one thing on that, and that's simply this. That if the people of the Tennessee Valley increase their capacity to buy, it helps the people of New York and Vermont, and the people of New York and Vermont have decided that by their political action a long time ago. So that I think we can move on to something else, unless Mr. Byfield wants to go back to that one again. No, I think that there's one more thing I'd like to say before we leave the TVA, and that in economics everything is a double entry. If you give those people cheaper power by taxing the people in Vermont, New York, and California to give them cheaper power, those taxes which were taken away from the people in those three states could have been used to increase their purchasing power. So you're gaining nothing. In fact, you're losing something. Well, Mr. Byfield, you call that socialism then. I think that's socialism. That's the welfare state because you take out of one pocket and you put it into another, and you lose something in the process. Right here in the same breath he said, socialism and the welfare state. Would you equate the two, Mr. LaFollette? No, I wouldn't equate the two, but I want to go back to this business of thought control for a minute, and I want to pick up a very nice sermon, which is spread by the Committee for Constitutional Government. This is a sermon by a divine, a pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Nashville, Tennessee, Dr. Walter R. Courtney. And so Dr. Courtney says in his thing, which is broadcast, you can get 40 or more copies of this for two and a half cents, and you're told to send it to everybody in your community. He said it's time for the South to serve its purpose of preserving the Union and championing free enterprise. Of course, he's against the FEPC, and he's against any progressive action. He's against free power, but he better not move over to Knoxville and make this sermon. But the thing that I want to point out about to the gentleman is this, and this is not Mr. Byfield, but to the Reverend Courtney, that the South has always accepted and received more in-flood control projects paid for by the Federal Government. If you want to turn over these things to states' rights, every time you want to turn them over to the state, the people who yell the loudest come running to the Federal Congress and say, for goodness' sakes, give us assistance. So that, again, this is no progress towards socialism. This is the use of a fake, economically unfair, and in my opinion, intellectually dishonest argument by a divine to spread thought control and fear in this country. If I've taken too much, I'm sorry, Mr. Byfield. I don't know anything about this minister. I've heard other people from the pulpit condemn capitalism along with communism, and when you came right down to it, they didn't know anything about economics and what makes the industrial clock tick or the wheels turn around. But to stick to this question of slogans, I think that the people who want to turn us into a unitary socialist state have had a head start on these businessmen that you're castigating here, and my friend Bob Taft, who certainly doesn't need me to support him, he can stand on his own feet. Remember all the stories about the old order a few years ago? Remember all the stories about the economic royalists? How about the nine old men? How about this slogan, boom and bust? The fellas that put those over were past masters. And what's happening this very day, certain people in Washington, certain businessmen, are being called monopolists when they're not monopolists at all. A monopoly is one seller, and you can't come down and call fifteen or twenty steel companies one seller. And if a man is a big monopolist, he becomes a predatory monopolist. That's what I call the language of prejudice, and the blueprint are the tactics of deceit, and the operation is the twisting of words to affect social controls, and I'm against it. If I understand your gentleman correctly, Mr. LaFollette sees this recent legislation as a political power for attempting to correct abuses, and Mr. Byfield sees a vicious plot to achieve political power for its own sake. Is that right? Yes, but Mr. Byfield, in my opinion, sees a ghost which doesn't exist. What I see is the propaganda of the Committee for Constitutional Action, which says that we need now an additional $250,000, plus $125,000 monthly. That adds up to $1,500,000 for 12 months and $1,750,000 if you add the $250,000, in addition to what they have to do what? To distribute things to stockholders, supervisory workers, thoughtful homeowning employees, and community opinion builders. I just read you from a community opinion builder, the Reverend Walter R. Courtney. All of the power in this fight for people's minds and to force people into the acceptance of something called the American Way, which equates democracy and the capitalistic system as we have it today without any change, is on the hands of the people who have the money in this country. Well, all I've got to say, I don't know anything about this particular committee, but from the figures that you've read, I think there are a lot of pikers. What's a million dollars compared to the tremendous propaganda organizations that Messrs. Brannon, Oscar Ewing, and all of the other, the fellows like Chapman have got? Now, Mr. Byfield, do you know that is not correct? Correct. Now, I'm going to talk over on that. They've got 35,000 people on their payroll. Those fellows that go around the country... And the Congress caught one of them talking about something the Congress didn't like the appropriations would go down. Well, that's theory. I know the facts of bloody lies. When a businessman comes to Washington to defend his own interests, he's called a lobbyist. But when these government fellows go out around the country preaching their propaganda, they only are marshalling public opinion. They don't ever travel. They just go on missions. That's where you people have got these words all twisted from their dictionary meanings into emotional meanings. That's why you're outsmarting us, and you're out talking us, and you're twice as articulate as we are. You sound like Arthur Kroc, who says that all the power is in the hands of reaction when the newspapers publish only the things that reactionaries publish, and no one else can get a thing into the paper. I'm going to step in here as a referee before someone is knocked down with a verbal right cross. We can argue all day about thought control, but I think in moving from slogans to the TVA to the question of who has the coercive power in this country, you gentlemen have demonstrated that here in the United States we are still free to air our opinions. May I say that we are glad it can happen on the Northwestern University reviewing stand. Thank you, gentlemen.
