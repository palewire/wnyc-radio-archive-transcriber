It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. RuPaul M. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me, since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public. My deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Your services for mankind. Thank you, Mr. President. Mayor Impelitari is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and bowing and bowing and bowing and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Vittorio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York. The mayor of Genoa. It is, with profound commotion, that I've heard her words affectionate and cordial regarding my modest person and regarding the noble city that I've been here to represent. There are facts and acts that are made by men, and every act that man has a unique meaning, but there are facts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is here in Europe and is here in my city, she did not have only made a cordial visit to all of us. She also has homage to the city-mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the recognition of the genovese so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is here in Genova, ambasciadora of democracy, of that democracy that is so expensive to the United States, but that is so expensive, so expensive to the Italians, especially in Genova. And especially in Genova, for this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, Gotti Pastoral that LEILIS, is here in REM, which is a film of the city its roots 1986, as she is given, as she has made a record of those charged lies of the city. Così, questa mia visita non è soltanto una risposta, non è soltanto una visita di cortesia, On. Impiniteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and his mayor, who has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is the statement of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic and has contributed to the of this man and the Italian population, the great people of the United States, the democracy of the United States, which we are deeply grateful for. We know all the sacrifices that this people have made to rid ourselves of democratic democratic freedom when we have intervened so presently in the war and today with many sacrifices material and of men. So today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocini of democracy and have operated intelligently because it is to defend the democracy in Europe and really in the world. And, onorevole Impeliteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work in this faith. Because the democratic democratic democratic freedom are really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For some time we are not aware of it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just when we were trapped in the war. We are living Danni and mankind. For example, country and Sandy about all people living the and all people living the war we lived in Jerusalem and living groups. It was so vivid that we had taken our work. We worked. We worked. We worked. We worked. We worked. We worked for the future. We built our country. It is with these sentiments, on the other side, that I salute you and the city of New York and say that we are tenacious in the work of the democracy in our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genova. The tenacious of Colombo in search of your land is an example to all of the genoveses. And, deriso, non creduto, contrastato da ogni avversità, dagli uomini e dagli avvenimenti, quest'uomo sapeva che questa grande terra esisteva e l'ha cercata disperatamente. E' andato assondando alle foci dei fiumi, e' andato cercando negli estuari, ovunque, cercando quel passaggio che lui voleva trovare per congiungere tutto il mondo sotto la croce cristiana. E' andato assolutamente, ebbene, non importa se lui poi non ha trovato il passaggio, non importa se ognuno di noi non trova il passaggio, bisogna persistere altri, troverà la strada. La strada perché tutto il mondo sia libero in pace e nel lavoro. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to general, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which mean so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy, with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
