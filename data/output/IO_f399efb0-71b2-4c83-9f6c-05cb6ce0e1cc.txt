It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the Chief Executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. First, the world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great Admiral. of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. For the critical times through which his nation has come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great pot you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Your services for mankind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

The mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco, New York. It's with profound commotion that I got to listen to your cries and words on your own sole fl divorces and cordially I have a profound commotion that I've heard her words affectionate and cordiales about my modest person and about the noble city that I've been here to represent. There are facts and acts that are made by men, and every act that man has a unique meaning, but there are facts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is here in Europe and is here in my city, she did not have only made a cordial visit to all of us. She also gave an homage to the city-mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, was here in Genova a ambassador of democracy. That democracy that is so expensive to the people of the United States, but that is so expensive to the people of the United States, especially to the people of the United States. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she was a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States and so every citizen of America, independent of its origin and social class, she was able to come she was able to come she was able to to reach the people of the United States. So this, this visit is not only a response, not only a visit to courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri, this visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and its own and its own mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is, above all, the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic life and has contributed to the modest way to reconstitution it, this visit is the salute of this man of the Italian population, the great people of the United States, the great people of the United States, the great people of the United States, which we are deeply grateful for because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to give us the democratic democratic freedom when we have intervened so presently in the war and today we have been able to protect them with many sacrifices material and of men and also to say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocini of the democracy and have operated intelligently to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in all the world. And, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work because the democratic freedom are really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For some time we are not understand we are not understanding. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just in the moment when we were we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. The Truth through hell but we got informed of the triumph and soviet Power and so far so was substance We got snapped we're broken our decisions we're still having wir semua to use moral and materiality our country. It is with these sentiments, on the other side, that I salute you and the city of New York and say that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in searching your own land is an example of all these Tapenes are considered to be supposed to see there. How does he work on Goliath �hh lips, shall he have been hidden through Gabi it, under the Christian cross, not matter if he then found the passage, not matter if each one of us doesn't find the passage, if we persist, others will find the way, the way to make everyone free, in peace and work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the Mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us. And we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end we shall succeed, we shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
