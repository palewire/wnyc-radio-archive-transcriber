Campion of the Pickpocket Squad. There are a number of detectives being advanced from detectives second grade to that of first grade, from third grade with additional compensation to second, from third grade without additional compensation to third grade with additional compensation. Ladies and gentlemen, members of the force, in view of the fact that there are a great number of men who are being advanced in grade, it has been decided that rather than read their names, that I tell you that there are 29 men advanced from second to first grade, 49 from third grade with additional compensation to second grade, and 82 from third grade to third grade with additional compensation. The total of all of the promotions today were 246 men. I think this has been the sixth or seventh time that I have been privileged to promote men in the department. I take great personal pride in being given that honor because it signifies to me that here are men, some men have waited many years. But here are men who by their own industry have exhibited a desire for self advancement. And I think that when we get a police force consisting of men who have not only their own interest for advancement at heart, but it must necessarily follow that they have the interest of the department at heart, that we are reaching the highest state of perfection. The fact that I have been able on six occasions to promote men of all ranks in the short space of time that I have been here indicates that we are on our way forward. The only sad note that I have today amidst this very happy gathering is that at one o'clock, I and the mayor are going to attend a funeral of one of you men who was one of us just a few days ago. Now he's being buried because he had the courage to come to the aid and assistance of one of our citizens that was in trouble. He was murdered. And it is little that I can do by going to the funeral of this brave man to show the rest of the department and the city as a whole how high we hold these men who wear our uniform. I think it's indicative of the entire feeling of the department when we lose a man such as Patrolman Randolph, that we as a group show our respect for something that the New York City Police have in abundance. And that's the unparalleled courage in the face of danger. I think that the city and the people of the city have never denied that. And that's why they are proud to have representing them, protecting them, their property and person, men such as you. Next month we are going to have 1,000 new men. And I hope later on in the year for an additional number. But I can see as these months go by that the New York City Police, in command of such men as yourselves, with these new men coming in, will be what it deserves to be, the greatest police force in the world. Now I can't help but call to your particular attention the fact that you receive these promotions today, only on your own merits. That's what I said when I came here. I will continue to say it until I leave. Every man on his own, with no question of influence or favor. And that's the way it should be. But even on that system, it couldn't be possible to have these promotions. unless you had a man like the mayor who is willing to provide the funds. And that's why I say it gives me great pleasure to ask the mayor, the man who is primarily responsible for your advancement money-wise, to say just a few words to you. Mr. Mayor. How you do, Mr. Mayor? Commissioner Murphy, members of the clergy, officers and members of the police department, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Murphy, members of the clergy, officers, members of the police department, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Murphy has very properly said that in the short period of time that he's been the police commissioner, there's been at least six or seven of these promotion ceremonies. That's been his policy, promoted by the police commissioner who has a deep interest in the welfare of the members of the force, who has a deep interest in keeping up the morale of the members of the police department, and during the entire time that Tom Murphy has been your police commissioner, he's had what I'm happy to point out, my wholehearted cooperation. During all of these promotion ceremonies, the question of money does arise from time to time, particularly in a year where you have a very tight budget, which we have this year, but in spite of the tightness of the budget, I've taken the position that it's important to all the people of the city of New York that those of us at the top levels of city government see to it that somehow or another funds are provided so that promotions are made when vacancies occur. I said that at the last promotion ceremony. That policy has continued unabated, and insofar as I am concerned, somehow or another, when vacancies occur, I will see to it, commissioner, that the funds are provided to fill those vacancies just as soon as humanly possible after they occur. In the same tenor, when commissioner Murphy took over, we both agreed on a policy of keeping the police force up to its normal strength. We've succeeded in doing that right up to the present time, and next month, very shortly, some 1,000 new members of the force will be appointed. That's only visible demonstration of the fact that both commissioner Murphy and myself mean to see to it the police force. We believe that this police force remains as the finest police force in the entire world. To the men who have been promoted today, 246 of them, we want you to know that you enjoy our confidence. When we say that you enjoy our confidence, it means that your promotions today will give testimony to all the people of the city of New York that the commanding officers of our police force and the other men who are appointed and promoted today to take over commanding ranks, whether it's the sergeant, whether it's the captain, whether it's the deputy inspector, whether it's the inspector, or the men in the detective bureau that have been promoted up the ranks. That demonstrates to the people of our city that based on the merit system, there's tremendous opportunity for promotion in our police force. We want to keep it exactly that way. To the families of all those promoted who are present here today in great abundance, we know that you share our pleasure in seeing these advancements made. I know it makes the children, the wives, the mothers and fathers of these men firm in their conviction that they belong to the families of men who represent the very best type of the citizenship we are happy to have in the city of New York. Thank you very much. His Honor, the Mayor and himself and some of our ranking officers have the unpleasant and sad duty to attend a funeral of a member of this department who was shot and killed in the line of duty. And that is one of the reasons that His Honor, the Mayor and the police commissioner, left. This will conclude the promotion ceremonies and exercises. I might add that the deputy chief inspectors, inspectors and deputy inspectors will report to the office of the chief of staff for assignment. The captain's and sergeants will report to the trial room for assignment. That will conclude the ceremonies. Coleman��
