Lehman Representative Eugene J. Keough And the other members of the New York Congressional Delegation The fact that the benefits of the plan are being extended today to the New York City area is due In no small measure to the endorsements which Representative Keough and Senator Lehman gave it While it was pending before the Congress The ideas embodied in the reorganization plan derived in part from a thorough unbiased examination Into the structure and operating methods of the Bureau of Internal Revenue By a New York firm of management engineers The firm of Cresset, McCormick, and Padgett Secretary Snyder has recently had a letter from a partner of these management engineers Mr. T. D. Morris Outlining his firm's observations as to the character of the job Being done to make reorganization effective I want to read two paragraphs from Mr. Morris' letter He said, Mr. Secretary I want to pass on to you Personally our feeling that the results being obtained in the Bureau of Internal Revenue Are in large measure attributable to the fine leadership Which you and other capable Treasury personnel have given And to the enlightened use which you have made of outside specialists Both in and outside of government My firm is indeed proud to have shared in planning these improvements And is convinced that under the continued leadership and interest Which has been displayed by you and other officials of the Treasury Department A record will be made in which all personnel of the Treasury Department Can take equal pride Thank you, Mr. Morris We are happy to have had And we appreciate The generous cooperation of many New Yorkers In arranging this ceremony We are happy, of course To have so many of you present here this morning The Bowling Green vicinity And this famous customs house Seem to me particularly appropriate for such a gathering Closely identified as they are With many forward steps in New York life Certainly there is every prospect That the steps we are taking here today Will be fruitful of real improvement and progress It is now my privilege, ladies and gentlemen To introduce the man whose guidance and inspiration Started the reorganization plan on its way six years ago And who patiently but resolutely Saw it through to the full accomplishment Ladies and gentlemen, the Honorable John W.

revenue operations To a career service Was authorized By the President's Reorganization Plan Number 1 Of 1952 New York City Is the second area In which the plan Has been placed in effect Reorganizations Will be completed In other areas Of the country Within the next few months I am glad That so many citizens Of New York Have gathered For this installation ceremony Their attendance Shows they appreciate The importance Of what is taking place Here today The reorganized Internal revenue offices In the city of New York In this district Will provide more convenient And faster

the city As a whole Formerly there was No counterpart In the revenue service For this position The three directors Of internal revenue Are responsible To the district commissioner He in turn Is directly responsible To the office Of the commissioner Of internal revenue In Washington These straight And clear lines Of authority And accountability Will help ensure More efficient service To the

revenue The district commissioner For New York City Who assumes His responsibilities Today Takes charge Of an area Of exceptional importance In the field Of public service This area Is of greater importance Than most people realize For in the fiscal year 1951 Its people And business concerns Accounted for almost 15% Of the internal revenue Collections For the entire United States During the calendar year 1951 alone This area Produced 8 billion 400 millions Of dollars Of internal revenue Collections Including such sums As 3 billion 200 million Dollars In corporate Income Income And profits Taxes And 4 billion Of dollars Of individual Income And employment Taxes The work Of the internal Revenue offices Here Does not end By any means With the collection Of income taxes During 1951

Processing Over 6 million Corporate Individual Payroll And other Federal tax Returns Returns Simplification Of all Federal tax Paying And tax Collecting Processes Was a major Goal In the preparation Of the revenue Service Reorganization Plan This goal Has been achieved In many Important Respects Prior to the Reorganization Reports Went to Washington From New York City Went through The offices Of three Collectors Three internal Revenue agents In charge An appellate Staff A regional Finance office A special Agent in charge And a district Supervisor Of alcohol Tax division That was a Total of Ten lines Of authority And responsibility In daily Operation Now There is But one Line From the District Commissioner To his Washington Superior Our fixed Purpose Is to Eliminate As many Complexities

Federal Tax Laws Has Been Tremendously Simplified Under The District Commissioner The Assistant District Commissioner For Intelligence Has very Important Responsibilities Under his Direction There will Be Intensified Efforts To see That every Fraudulent Attempt To evade Federal Taxes Will bring Quick Investigation And action The task Of fighting Tax Frauds Never Was an Easy One In recent Years

Service With even Greater Enforcement Activity And prosecution Last year Additional Taxes And penalties Resulting From tax Fraud Investigation In this Area Amounted To approximately 75 million Dollars This activity Will be Stepped up Under the Direction Of the Assistant District Commissioner For intelligence To the Full limit Of available Manpower The fact That the Reorganization Plan Makes Possible A more Thorough Audit Of all Types Of returns Will have A direct And forceful Effect In the War Against Tax Dodging The Plan Is a Forward Step In Government Streamlining Operations

Extension Of The Merit System Throughout The Service Will Help Develop Great Efficiency And Loyalty Among The Bureau's Employees Promotion Opportunities Are Being Broadened Throughout The Field Service It Is A Significant Fact That The Reorganization Of The Revenue Service Has Been Accomplished Through Six Years Of Intensive Study And Effort It Was By No Means A Quickly Conceived Plan It Becomes Evident It Became Evident To Me Shortly After I Became Secretary Of The Treasury In 1946 That The Revenue Service Had Suffered Severely Due To The Conditions Under Which It Had To Expand Under Wartime Restrictions And Developments There Had Been A Great Increase In The Number Of Tax Returns Filed And The Amount Of Revenue Collected Many Expert Employees Had Been Called Into The Armed Forces New Tax Legislation Had Been Inactive The Workload Had Increased Enormously And The Bureau Had Not Been Able To Modernize Its Operations Due To Shortage Of Up-To Date Equipment We Immediately Set About To Improve Management Methods And Achieve Greater Operating Efficiency But Every Change Had To Be Made Without Interrupting The Services Continued Task Of Collecting Revenues And Enforcing The Tax Laws Conferences Were Held With Many Groups Of Revenue Officials As Early As October 1946 To Discuss Problems And Suggest Solutions A Work Simplification Program Was Set Up As A Means Of Enlisting The Aid Towards Improved Efficiency Task Forces Of Key Officials Were Established To Make Specific Surveys And Reports Congressional Recommendations Were Given The Closest Attention A Firm Of Management Engineers Was Employed To Analyze Operations Of The Service And Suggest Other Improvements The Alcohol Tax And Tobacco Tax Divisions Of Years We Have Gradually Reorganizing The Bureau Of Internal Revenue Until We Have Reached This Final Step In A Long Series Of Actions Taken By The Treasury Department To Improve And Streamline The Federal Tax Collection System The President's Reorganization Plan Number One Of 1952 Is The Capstone Of This Progressive Development In Placing The Plans In Effect We Have Made It Our Objective That Only The Most Capable Persons Available Would Be Named To The Positions Of District Commissioner Of Internal Revenue Director Of Internal Revenue And Other Supervisory Post To Accomplish This End I Set Up A Selection Board Made Up Of Top Career Officials Of The Treasury And Of The Bureau Of Internal Revenue Which Acting Under Civil Service Commission Rules And Regulations Has Inquired Painstakenly Into The Qualifications And Records Of All
