Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We're speaking to you from historic City Hall in New York, this being another great day in the annals of civic affairs. As you know, City Hall Plaza has been the scene of many of these great celebrations, days of ceremony, days of rejoicing, and official receptions to the heads of governments of other lands. And today, New York City officially greets to its heart the president of the provisional government of the Republic of France, General Charles de Gaulle. General de Gaulle, Mayor LaGuardia, and their parties left Idlewild Airport about an hour and a half ago, making their way in solemn procession through the streets of New York City, down to the tip of lower Manhattan, and coming up Broadway, would then make their way to the rear of City Hall, in through the rear entrance, onto the steps in front of City Hall, that's at City Hall Plaza itself, and up onto the temporary platform which has been erected by the Department of Parks. City Hall Plaza today is just about as colorful as it was on another day, not so very long back, when we greeted General Dwight D. Eisenhower. There's a lot of military here today, but there isn't very much brass. All branches of the armed forces are represented. The Army, the Navy, the Coast Guard. Not only of our own armed services, but also of those of the Republic of France. I can see over on the east side of the runway, leading to the platform, a detachment of the Marine National. Below the stand is a detachment of the Lafayette Cadets, who will play the ruffles greeting General de Gaulle upon his arrival. Over on the far east side is the band of the Department of Sanitation, under the direction of John F. Celebrate. Here on the west side, now playing, is the fire department band, under the direction of Honorary Battalion Chief George F. Bregel. There are some 25,000 or 30,000 people gathered here in City Hall Plaza this afternoon. Not all of them of French descent, but I should imagine that the greater percentage of them are of French descent. You know, New York City has a French colony of some 350,000 or 375,000 people. And they've turned out this morning, not only along the route which the General and his party took to reach City Hall Plaza, but also down here in City Hall Plaza itself. Over on my right, that's on the west side of City Hall Plaza, is a detachment of military police, heavily armed, forming part of the bodyguard for the General. Over on the far side, that's on the east side, is another detachment of the same military police. On the steps of City Hall Plaza are detachments of the Coast Guard and of the United States Navy. And flanking the runway, as I just mentioned a moment or two ago, to the platform itself, on the east side, a detachment of the Marine National, on the west side, a group of veterans of the United States Army, of various divisions and various battalions, all wearing their insignia and the ribbons which they have received in action. They, too, are fully armed. New York City is well prepared to guard against any eventualities which might occur for its welcome to such a distinguished guest as General Charles de Gaulle. Many of you, of course, will remember a former visit of General de Gaulle here to New York City. And today, with victory in the hands of the Allied Nations, it is really a very happy privilege to be able to greet him back as the head of the provisional government of his country. Looking down on stage, I can see two very distinguished artists known to music lovers all over the world. Marcel Degna, to the left, who will sing La Marseillaise with the Department of Sanitation band. To the right, Helen Jepsen of the Metropolitan, who will sing our own national anthem with the Fire Department band. In the far distance, down about the foot of City Hall Park, where Park Row and Broadway meet opposite St. Paul's, I can hear a military band, which probably is preceding the General's party as it slowly makes its way up Broadway. About six or seven minutes ago, the police shortwave told us that the party was then at Exchange Place and Broadway. That's down on the part of the financial district, of course. There's a reason for the General having made this roundabout tour. I think probably it was due to the fact that he had to pass the consulate on Fifth Avenue at Rockefeller Center, and then down through the representatives of the various steamship lines and of the consulates down in lower Manhattan at the lower tip of Broadway itself. The platform which the Park Department erected here within the past two or three days is fully flanked by the flags of the United Nations. And on the south side of the plaza itself, a steel stand has been erected about 20 feet high, which is crowded with press photographers, movie cameramen, of course. And just below the stand, in the plaza itself, are the representatives of the press, the national, local, and international press. I can see over here to my left, Commissioner Paul Moss, who arrived a few minutes ago with Helen Jepsen. My Cedena has been here quite a long time this morning. As a matter of fact, she was here at about 11 o'clock, a quarter of 11, when I got here myself. Over on Broadway now, at approximately, I should say, Warren Street, is the band which is preceding the official cars as they're making their way up Broadway to turn left, that is, to turn east, or right rather, east, into City Hall, the rear side of City Hall. The general has party, Mayor LaGuardia, Grover Whalen, and the official reception committee making their way through the rear of the City Hall itself, through the building, and into the plaza on the south side. Curiously enough, we've been having a great deal of music here all morning for the past hour and a half, the fire department band, the sanitation department band, and the police glee club, which is up on the balcony immediately above us. They've been entertaining the some 25,000 or 30,000 people gathered here in the plaza all this time. And now I can see the flags of the United States and of the Republic of France passing the west entrance to City Hall Plaza. I believe it is the police department band which is preceding the official cars. All I can see are the tops of their caps, and it looks to me very much as if that's what it is. Probably Eugene Labar conducting. And then we will, in just a moment or two, be able to see the official cars as they're making their way up Broadway after having left Idlewild earlier this morning and after having passed through the major points of interest in the city itself. I have somewhere here the line of march. Of course, those of you who happen to be somewhere out on the street were able to see for yourselves. The actual line of march was from Idlewild Airport at 1045 all the way down to Battery, Whitehall and South Streets at 1145 and then arriving here. Immediately following the reception at City Hall whereby General de Gaulle will be made an honorary citizen of this great city of ours. They will leave immediately before the Waldorf Astoria where a luncheon, an official luncheon will be given to the General by the City of New York at 2 o'clock this afternoon. At 2.30, the General and his party will leave for LaGuardia Field arriving there at 3 o'clock and then leaving for Chicago. General de Gaulle has been a rather busy man since he arrived in this country last week. He's had several interviews with President Truman, official receptions in Washington, of course. And yesterday he paid his respects to Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt and laid a wreath on the grave of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Hyde Park. Immediately after that, he went to West Point where he had lunch and inspected the United States Military Academy. He arrived here in New York City yesterday afternoon, a rather weary man but a very happy one, and took up his quarters in the Waldorf Astoria where he has been until sometime about 8.30 this morning when he left for Idlewild Airport where he was met by Mayor LaGuardia and after the brief inspection tour of that great new airport which is still being constructed and which is to be the greatest airport in the world, the General and his party, Mayor LaGuardia and his official reception committee then made their way through the streets of the city, across the Pryboro Bridge, through the streets of the city, down to Battery Place, up Broadway, and now we're quite sure that the General must be about ready to leave his car on the north side of City Hall to make his way through the building and then he, with his immediate entourage, his aides, will make their way out onto the platform to be given the honorary citizenship of this city. In the immediate entourage of General de Gaulle are Monsieur Georges Bideau, the French Foreign Minister, Monsieur Henri Bonnet, the French Ambassador to the United States, General Join, the Chief of National Defence, Monsieur de Beaumont, the Consul General, Admiral Feinard, General Didier, Monsieur Falefsky, the Chief Advisor to General de Gaulle, Monsieur Alphard and Monsieur Falefsky, two of his other advisors. The United States is represented by Stanley Woodward of the State Department, Captain Michelet of the United States Navy and General Waite of the United States Army. And ladies and gentlemen, you've just heard the call to attention, which means that General Charles de Gaulle and his party, Mayor F. H. LaGuardia and his party, are now making their way into the building and will then be at ease has been given. That was a bit of a false alarm, I believe. He is still just making his way into the rear of the building and has not yet made his way into the building proper. The photographers are milling about. The flashes are now being taken. Mayor LaGuardia is coming in now and General de Gaulle will immediately follow. We'll hear the command issued again to come to attention. And immediately following that, the drum and bugle corps of the Lafayette cadets will play the ruffles, greeting General de Gaulle. I can see Grover Whalen inside the building now, which means that he probably is immediately flanked by the others. I've just been informed that General de Gaulle is going into the mayor's office for a moment or two before making his appearance here on the stand. It's somewhat difficult at times in ceremonies of as great importance as this to have things run exactly to the split second. However, the General's immediate entourage and his aides are now making their way out onto the platform. You can probably hear the applause in the background, which is greeting their arrival. And so I should imagine that General de Gaulle and Mayor LaGuardia will be making their appearance in a very brief space of time. As soon as I can see them making their way around the corner here, I'll notify you to that effect and then let you know when the ruffles are to be played, greeting General de Gaulle. Then Marcel Denia to sing the Marseillaise with the Department of Sanitation Band. Helen Deption to sing our own national anthem with the Fire Department Band. It's quiet here now. Everybody's just a wee bit tense. It's the 350,000 or 375,000 members of the French colony in New York City anxiously awaiting a sight of the leader of their country. He is the president of the provisional government of France, General Charles de Gaulle. The photographers are on the runway leading to the platform itself. They're on the far end and they're already there with their classes. There are three banks of them, as a matter of fact. One bank kneeling, one bank half-squatted, and the third bank standing straight. Just to be sure that they won't miss anything of the arrival of General de Gaulle as he makes his way out onto the platform for his official reception by the city of New York and is being made an honorary citizen of this great city of ours. There's a poor little baby around who's somewhat tired after being down here for the past hour and a half. She and her mother are dressed in the provincial costume of one of the provinces of the Republic of France. You may probably have seen these tremendous black ribbon headdresses, embroidered skirts with overflows of lace, and the lace shawls. Well, the little child, who can't be more than about three or four years of age, I imagine, is dressed as a miniature replica of her mother. And she being tired is probably just crying. Her mother's taken her into City Hall, and she may even have the opportunity of being just a little bit closer to the General when he makes his arrival. The crowd here, some 25,000 or 30,000 strong, is becoming just a little bit impatient now. They're calling for the General to make his appearance. Now, what the reason was for his going into the mayor's office, I don't know. Probably a little tired. He may have wanted to wash his hands. After all, he has his dignity to uphold, and that may be part of the reason for his going into the mayor's office. As I told you before, not so very long back, City Hall Plaza was the scene of a tremendous demonstration to General of the Army, Dwight D. Eisenhower, when he, too, was made an honorary citizen. And today, we greet this leader of a great people, one of the great nations of the world, the Republic of France. General de Gaulle will be leaving this afternoon, after his official luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria, from LaGuardia Airfield to Chicago, where another reception is waiting him there. It seems very much that with the fast action since D-Day and with V-J Day to be announced within the next week or so, that City Hall Plaza may be the scene of many more such ceremonies as we greet our returning heroes. I read in the papers this morning where General of the Army's Douglas MacArthur is to be given probably the greatest reception ever tendered anyone down in Washington. And I imagine that New York City won't permit itself to be outdone by any other city in this great land of ours. The crowd is still milling around. The police department guard of honor flanking the entrance through the building and on the steps here, standing at attention, there's a detachment of policewomen too. At least we're fortunate for one thing, it is a beautiful day. The sun is coming down, yet it isn't too warm. And we can only be happy that General de Gaulle should be made an honorary citizen of New York under such auspicious conditions. The photographers are still waiting very anxiously. They've been here, oh, since early this morning, taking shots of the people as they took their places. There were some 10,000 or 12,000 seats arranged for those who were fortunate enough to obtain tickets. The others are just spread throughout the park. Now, I mentioned a minute ago or so that there were about 25,000 or 30,000 people here. I'm afraid that I'll have to revise that estimate because there must have been a great number of people along Broadway from the battery up waiting on the line of march for the passage of General de Gaulle and his party. And now, ladies and gentlemen, here is General Charles de Gaulle and Mayor LaGuardia. Listen to the calls to attention and the ruffles. lodging theара and allemaal with the dies and the sine and amounts of szczent and morality and the crime and so on. Cheers, pro80和尼 Thank you. Thank you. Just fire to the singing and the playing of our two answers. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. There is some delay on stand, ladies and gentlemen. Now, here is Marcel Degna and La Marseillaise. размер seems like theND captive Frederic Meyer Marchant, marchant, Comme ça veut dire, Pour plus, plus si fort, Pour plus, plus si fort, Pour plus, plus si fort, Marchant, marchant, Comme ça veut dire, Pour plus, plus si fort, Mais quand vous voyez, By the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hail, Of the twilight's not gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, Through the perilous fight, On ramparts we watched, From so gallantly streaming, And rocket's red glare, The bombs bursting in air, They proved through the night, What a flight was still there, Oh, say, For the land of the free, And the home of the free, For the land of the free, And the home of the free, Marcel Denia, Marcel Denia, With the Department of Sanitation band, Sang the Marseillaise, And the Marseillaise, Helen Jepsen with the fire department band, Sang our own national anthem, And now the military has been given its command, And at ease, And in just a moment, The official ceremonies will get underway, I understand that Grover Whalen, Who has been on the platform here in City Hall Plaza, For many, many occasions in this past generation or so, Is to introduce Mayor LaGuardia, Who as the mayor of the city of New York, Will greet General De Gaulle, Will make him an honorary citizen, Following which General De Gaulle will respond, And the floor of the ceremonies will then be over, And the general and his party, The mayor and his party, Will then make their way to Waldorf Astoria, For the official luncheon. And now, let us listen to the Croix de Lorraine, Which is being played by the Department of Sanitation band. The mayor and his party, The mayor and his party, The mayor and his party, And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mayor LaGuardia. Mr. President, Fellow of the Yorkers, I am sure, Mr. President, That you are convinced Of the love and affection Of the people of my city For the people of your country.
