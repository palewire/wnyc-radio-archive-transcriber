Chapter 5 In this edition, we present an actuality report from Church House West, sir, of the Lincoln City of the United Nations Security Council. You will hear the voices of several of the delegates, and as they continue their discussion on the subject of the presence of British soups and drinks. This is Judene Hawley speaking for Radio Misrael from London. The United Nations Security Council has a busy day with the business of electing judges to the Court of International Justice. When the Council met this evening for its second sitting of the day, they dealt for the first few minutes with this old same subject. However, very soon they were back on the old familiar topic of the presence of British soups and grief. Mr. Macon, the chairman, called the delegates to order, and there was an expectant rush in the conference room, for everyone was aware of the great significance of the subject about to be reopened. Mr. Macon began by reading a statement from the chair. Here is the voice of Mr. Macon. Mr. Macon, the chairman, and I would wish to make a statement to the Council that possibly might be accepted as a statement of the Council. Mr. Macon, the chairman, and I'll just read what I have in mind, which have, of course, weapons to the matter that we have been discussing in the last few days, which has weapons to the public situation. I would suggest the first-month panel, a suitable statement, as we made by myself as chairman of the Security Council, and it reads in the following terms. The Security Council has heard statements by the governments of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Greece, which have greatly clarified the position. I would like to see the matter dispersed of, I would like to send the matter dispersed of by a resolution. But not matter not having been declared a dispute, it will be sufficient for me to make a short summary of the position in the Council, as revealed by what has been said at this table. The majority of the members of the Council have expressed their views, and in the President's opinion, it is the sense of the Council that the presence of British troops in Greece does not endanger the maintenance of international peace and security. It seems to me that the Council may now regard the matter as placed. The only cross-narrative is to proceed to the next business. I hope that there was a reason of the Council. At this point, we were certain Mr. Vyshynski would have something to say. Sure enough, the delegates from the Soviets addressed the meeting. Mr. Vyshynski said that the Soviet delegation was ready to show its spirit of cooperation and to leave aside anything which should threaten the unity of action of the Security Council. He insisted on a very exact translation of his next words, and a jively translation, phrase by phrase, to the following statement. We do not expect to obtain that this declaration should state that the presence of British troops in Greece presents a danger to peace and security. And we do not insist that the declaration of the revolution should mention that the situation in connection with the presence of British troops in Greece constitutes a danger to peace and security. And we do not insist that this resolution or declaration should mention that the British troops must be withdrawn to peace. The Soviet delegation is ready to enter into concession in the interest of the cooperation between role members of the Security Council. The eyes of the Soviet delegation, it is in fact the main condition and perhaps the only way to ensure the success of the organization. The Soviet delegation would agree on the following points. One, the Security Council does not take a formal decision or a formal resolution regarding the situation in Greece. Two, the Soviet delegation would be satisfied by a declaration held in by the government. Three, in the declaration of the government, it should be said that the Soviet Council, I'm sorry, that the Security Council takes note of the declaration made by the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the U.S. and also takes into account the declarations made by the representatives of the United States of America, France, China, Poland, Egypt and the Netherlands regarding the situation connected with the question of the presence of British troops in Greece. This has been registered in the Vatican report of our meeting. And the Council declares that the question is thereby closed. These are the maximum conditions on which the Soviet government would be in agreement and that no other would be acceptable and they shall object to any other wording. When this mission gets finished, the delegate for Brazil has to be allowed to speak these words. Now, Mr. Chairman, the opinion of the allegations has been quoted and likes to state our point of view. I will go to claim a resolution that is declared as a criminal opinion was the presence of British troops in the United States in the United States. The troops in Greece do not involve the troops. That has been evidence shown in the debates of the world. A cover that does not imply the case of looking that foreign troops are not needed to watch the lines of elections except in the case of tax-revening economy. the president's of the United States. I would like to make very clear that any resolution would be taken in establishing that the president of the foreign and the British first-degree is the best to do the old. The president's delegate was followed by a list of the ten years speaking for the United States. Chairman, I think we'll manage a state problem in the 60-degree mask last night. I don't know about the pastor of the United States government is willing to accept the problem that's to verify the cabinet of the source of the government. I wish to make it clear of the remarks that I am going to go that he's a the best position of the United States stands. I shall hold the questions of the fact that the members were spoken on this question of all individuals that they are used to the position at the state of Miami at that point. I'm happy to endorse the suggestion of the government. There followed a discussion on the point of Bettscats and by him Mr. Betts who had maintained violence at this point of the floor. This is what he said. I've listened with very great interest to the statement made by Mr. Vassensky. I appreciate very much the consideration of the members of the delegates in the United States and the other countries which are playing against me. I'm anxious to see the elimination of all forms between the great public and the great witness. And I'm there. I'm there. I'm there. I'm there. I'm there. I'm there. . I'm not because you're 커� ...nearly with the final statement. But with the other statement, I understand it's very next to you. And any final statement is representing the contained land that you may like. I can't follow the translations very well. And I would like to add another translation of the authentic translation of the interesting translations. And I would like to ask for an adjournment and for the office to do it to me. And I promise, and I will keep you waiting for us. And I promise, and I promise, let's, um, we will keep you waiting for us. I'm just going to try to describe a recent proposal of the United Kingdom, and I'm sure I remember from the Council that there will not be a long period in respect of the Germans that it can possibly be, uh, in terms of the authorities. The German lasted the better part of an hour. And the delegates of the General Assembly, Mr. Devon, who have been examining the facts in the Kaczynski statement, once again, the best authority count. These are the main points of his remarks. The central delegates of the USA, Australia, France, China, Poland, Egypt, Brazil, and the Netherlands. The current views of the central ministries in Greece that now constitute a situation likely to engage in the alteration of the International Council of Foreigners. I am concerned, on my part, there are similar gestures and simulations. What time... What time says, upon any formal resolution in regard to the letter? The country will think between our two Greek nations has now been closed. Very soon, I've been urged to meeting again, but not before the Greek Foreign Minister, who was the guest of the Council, voices government acceptance to the Stata agreed upon both the country and the Council and thanked the Council for its unparrowing efforts to bring the matter to an amicable conclusion. Mr. Vyshinsky, too, accepted the solution and added his hopes that Anglo-Soviet friendship would develop and grow. So was the delegates from the Security Council, in completed reasons, they passed on to the next item on December. The BBC Radio News News, broadcast by September 2,000 and 41 nights.

To establish the flow of fuel as quickly as it is humanly possible, as it is humanly possible, with respiratory illness or disease, and to replenish the fuel and supplies of our hospitals and other institutions, I have assured Mr. Turner that he will receive complete police cooperation, and have apprised Commissioner Wallander of this latest development in the emergency. Because of the grave conditions, I am further compelled to warn every owner and operator of business establishments, of all kinds in the City of New York, that such fuel and coal supplies as are brought in by the Office of Defense Transportation, will be rationed in absolute accordance with the priority order I issued two days ago. Not one single delivery will be permitted to any building, public or private, without clearance at the yards, by health inspectors and representatives of the fuel administrator's office. If the present fuel supplies of owners and operators of business establishments will not last more than a week, I strongly urge that they consider closing immediately in order to conserve fuel and protect property. Instructions have been issued to the police department, but every load of oil or coal coming into New York, through the tunnels or over the bridges, or by any other means, is to be routed in accordance with the priority regulations. The police will enforce this order. As of this moment, the situation regarding the fuel supply is as follows. Commissioner Stebbin informs me that less than one day's supply of fuel remains in one of the largest hospitals in the city. This supply was procured today only by diversion from a commercial establishment. There are now many apartment houses, absolutely without heat and with no possibility of relief. Hundreds of dwellings, single and multiple, are without coal. Fuel oil supplies in all public buildings are dangerously low. Thousands of people in coal water flats are without kerosene and therefore without heat. Additional public buildings must be closed. This condition will multiply very rapidly because there are absolutely no reserves. I have been informed that the American Federation of Labor in the city of New York has joined with the mayor in urging all members of the union to return to work under conditions where their interests will be completed protected. Thomas A. Murray, president of the New York State Federation of Labor, Martin T. Lacey, and Jane Day Quinn, president and secretary of the Central Trade and Labor Council of Greater New York, the AFL, have already advised the men to return. Certainly, they should heed the advice of their friends. That was the statement by Mayor William O'Guire released just a few moments ago here in his office in City Hall. This is Seymour Siegel now returning you to the Masterwork Tower. So then I'll end up with his turn. Alright so how wants to enjoy the automated chain box cover theangi!
