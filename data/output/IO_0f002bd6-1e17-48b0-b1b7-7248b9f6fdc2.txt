We hear first, The Banks of Allen Water, followed by Now is the Month of Maying. The Banks of Allen Water, Where the spring springtime may fall, On the miller's lovely daughter, There has come them all, For it's dry, a soldier's summer, And a willing tongue can hear, On the banks of Allen Water, Now is the May and King. The Banks of Allen Water, Where the known of the spread is so, There has come them hill and snow, But she's blinded by the old boy, For the summer, free, and water, And the soldier falls not in, On the banks of Allen Water, Now is the Father's Sheep. The Banks of Allen Water, When the winter snow fell past, Till the sea of the miller's door, Chilling blue of glass, On the miller's lovely older, Oh, from gold and careless spring, On the banks of Allen Water, Where the snow falls past, Till the sea of the sea, And the sea of the sea, And the sea of the sea, And the sea of the sea, And the sea of the sea...
