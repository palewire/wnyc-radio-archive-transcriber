This afternoon, most of you participated in the very simple and significant ceremony by which this magnificent place was transferred to the University to serve as a home for this and future meetings of the American Assembly. This represents, from the standpoint of the University, the fulfillment of an aspiration for such a conference center which we have long held. We believe that the plans which have been made and which are now approaching fruition have been soundly made. We believe, and indeed I need not add that we hope, that this will prove to be an institution of national service which will thoroughly justify the effort that has been made to make it available. And which will justify, in addition, the generosity of the Harriman brothers whose assist without his assistance this could not have been done. And so, ladies and gentlemen, I have the very great pleasure, on behalf of the University Administration, now in turning this meeting and the future sessions of this meeting of the Assembly, over to Ambassador Douglas, the Chairman of the National Policy Board, in whose hands we are from now on. Ambassador Douglas. Ambassador Douglas. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Grace B. Kirk, Vice President and Provost of Columbia University. Now Ambassador Douglas. Dr. Kirk, members of the American Assembly, and its guests, in calling this assembly, this first session of the American Assembly, to order, as it were, I am not unconscious of the handicap under which it is being held. It is the handicap of the absence of the president of Columbia University, General Eisenhower. He regrets deeply that his duties elsewhere prevent him from participating in this session of the Assembly. But he's expressed his own feelings much more adequately and much more pungently and much more convincingly than I could do it for him. He's written me a letter which he has asked me to read to you. My inability to attend the opening conference of the American Assembly is more than a personal disappointment. I feel robbed of an opportunity to participate in an event which I am firmly convinced will grow to be a program of incalculable value to our country. This value will, of course, depend on the objectivity and impartiality of the proceedings, the integrity and thoroughness of the professional research work, and upon the character and qualifications of the participants. of the allies, as an Gesichter Worldинойioso Nation obviously means to remainachts and workalyzed HIMSELF. In its traditional stage a physical Anti-Astraight some group 항еты체val entre a Chand hairstylist group of First Albert Albert, conservative European Craigsby, who are wisdom and bends still across from a high spiritar. in the conduct of future meetings of the American Assembly. But the quality of those who attend this conference, their abilities and high loyalty to the nation's welfare, assure its unqualified success. I hope you will give Senator Taft, which the moment has been detained, and Senator Douglas, my sincere thanks for taking the time from their public duties to speak on this occasion. I hope, too, that you will extend to every participant the assurance of my personal appreciation for this cooperation, as well as a warm welcome from the Columbia University family to the home of the American Assembly. with cordial personal regard, Ike Eisenhower. It is a very real infirmity that he cannot be here. For this is his creature. This is the child of his mind. And his personality is necessary to the growth of this infant during its early days. I am but a very poor substitute. But I am sure that you all will join with me in expressing the hope that at the next meeting of the Assembly, General Eisenhower will be here to nourish and foster the creature of his own imagination. There is little that I can say about the Assembly, the American Assembly, that has not already been said. But there are two observations that I should like to make. The first is that if it is to discharge adequately and effectively the responsibilities which we all repose upon it, then it must preserve with meticulous care its complete intellectual independence. Its critical faculties must be guarded. Its intellectual integrity must be defended against any inclusion. I remember once, many years ago, sitting with... ...Cremon Sal, in his little fisherman's cottage in the Vendée. I asked him what he considered to be the most valuable qualities that a person could possess. ...and after considering the question for a few minutes, he placed his hand upon my knee and he said, ...My son, I have lived almost the span of a century. And so he has. ...And he said, I have seen kingdoms made. I have seen kingdoms destroyed. He chuckled. ...And he said, I have probably destroyed more government than any other living person. ...And as I review this scene, he said, I have come to the conclusion that there are only two things in life that really matter. ...The first is to love and to be loved, and the second is to be intellectually honest. ...Now that quality of intellectual integrity is a quality which the American Assembly must preserve. ...If usefulness will depend largely upon its ability to protect that one essential characteristic. ...And the second observation I should like to make about the first session of the American Assembly... ...is that because it is the first meeting, it must by its nature be experimental. Experimental in the way in which the data has been assembled and distributed to the participants. Experimental in the organization of this particular meeting. ...Experimental in the way in which the findings, if any, shall be distributed throughout the public consciousness of the country. This is an extraordinarily difficult task that has been undertaken. And it will not be easy to find the answers that from day to day and month to month will put in their questions, that will put in their appearance. And so you must, I hope you will, view this as the first earnest and sincere endeavor to perform a national service. ...If you have criticisms, as I hope you will have. If you have suggestions, and I am confident that you will entertain them. ...We express the expectation that you will express them. ...So that future sessions of the Assembly can be improved by this experience. ...I have said that this first session was operating under a handicap. ...And so it is. ...But on the other side of the coin... ...there is an advantage... ...For both Senators... ...Senator Douglas and Senator Tapp... ...I've agreed this evening... ...to present alternative views... ...of the issues which they... ...believe to be associated with and implicit in... ...the subject which was chosen for this meeting of the Assembly. That is, the United States' relationship with Western Europe. ...Due from within the context... ...of the present worldwide international environment. ...And I should like to add... ...Your appreciation... ...to the appreciation of... ...of General Eisenhower... ...to both... ...Senator Douglas... ...and to Senator Tapp... ...For taking the time from their public duties... ...to start this session off... ...With... ...What may be two... ...somewhat divergent... ...Statements of opinion... ...And... ...Of facts. Ultimately, we hope... ...That this Assembly will be able to define... ...Some area of agreement... ...And that it will also be able to define... ...An area of disagreement. Disagreements are not... ...in themselves... ...Injurious to a free society. Indeed... ...As long as men are free... ...Disagreements... ...will always exist. The important thing... ...about disagreements in a free society... ...is they reflect... ...An honest disagreement. And so... ...It would be of great significance... ...To... ...The country... ...If this Assembly... ...Could it do no more... ...Were to define... ...Honestly... ...And with complete integrity... ...An area of disagreement... ...As to fact... ...And as to conclusion. ...And this evening... ...Senator Douglas has... ...Agreed to speak... ...Senator Taft... ...Similarly... ...And here he is... ...I'm sorry, Bob... ...We've proceeded... ...Knowing that you would come... ...Because... ...Of... ...Of... ...Of... ...The time element... ...On the... ...Limitations of time... ...On the radio. Senator Taft has agreed... ...Very generously... ...To speak this evening... ...And Senator... ...Douglas... ...Similarly... ...Has agreed to speak. After they have finished... ...And concluded... ...Their presentation... ...They have... ...Agreed... ...To submit themselves... ...To questions... ...I shall be the... ...Arbiter... ...Of... ...The nature... ...Of... ...The question... ...Of... ...The time... ...But I'd like to make... ...This... ...Quite clear... ...That any question... ...Which is put to either... ...Of... ...The two... ...Distinguished Senators... ...Will be put... ...Similarly... ...To the other... ...And the questions... ...Will alternate... ...Senator... ...Douglas... ...Will speak first... ...And Senator Taft... ...Will speak second... ...The first question... ...Will be put... ...To Senator Taft... ...And the similar... ...Question... ...An identical... ...Question... ...Will be put... ...To Senator Douglas... ...Is he... ...Did we have... ...All... ...There... ...And... ...And... ...Before we go further... ...I again... ...Should like to express... ...Our gratitude... ...Collectively... ...And individually... ...To both Senator Douglas... ...And Senator Taft... ...For agreeing... ...to come here... ...And to start... ...This first session... ...Of the Assembly... ...Off... ...As it were... ...On... ...A High Plane... ...Nither one... ...Of these two gentlemen... ...Need... ...Inroduction... ...And I would be... ...Wasting your time... ...Their time... ...And everybody else's time... ...If I were to... ...If I were to attempt... ...To introduce them... ...I merely want to make it clear... ...That... ...The one... ...Is entitled... ...To as much respect... ...As the other... ...This is a... ...frightly difficult... ...Thing to do... ...I could say something... ...very nice about both of them... ...And be quite honest... ...And that I shall... ...Senator Douglas... ...Has been a distinguished... ...Member of the Senate... ...Since he first went there... ...In 1945... ...With his views... ...Many of us... ...Have from time to time... ...Disagree... ...But no one of us... ...Has ever questioned... ...His intellectual integrity... ...And with the... ...Full assurances... ...Of all three unions... ...You're coming here tonight... ...Our respect for you... ...As an individual... ...And as a member of... ...The second... ...Mount's Distinguished... ...Branch... ...Of the Legislative... ...Part... ...In the United States... ...Government... ...I introduce you... ...I introduce you... ...My namesake... ...Mr. Douglas... ...My friend and colleague... ...Mr. Cass... ...Friend to the Assembly... ...It's a very... ...Real honor... ...to be... ...Invited to... ...Help... ...Initiate... ...The discussion... ...In this opening session... ...Of the American Assembly... ...And one naturally... ...Feels quite... ...Humble... ...And somewhat... ...Inadequate... ...Before they... ...Past... ...I'm afraid... ...That most of the things... ...That I have to say... ...About the... ...Importance... ...Of Western Europe... ...To the United States... ...Will seem... ...Fairly obvious... ...And... ...Perhaps trite... ...To such an able audience... ...As this... ...My only excuse is... ...The saying of Dr. Johnson... ...That men need... ...Not so much... ...To be informed... ...Has to be reminded... ...And also perhaps... ...I can... ...Lay a basis... ...For the discussion... ...Much more valuable... ...Discussion... ...Which will follow... ...In the days ahead... ...I want to start... ...With the... ...Fundamental thesis... ...That it is... ...Of vital importance... ...To the United States... ...That Western Europe... ...Should not fall... ...Into Russian hands... ...Would not... ...Seem necessary... ...To labor this point... ...Were it not for the fact... ...That there are... ...Still many in this country... ...Who... ...Seem to believe... ...That the United States... ...Could ultimately... ...Go it alone... ...And have a very good chance... ...For survival... ...If we did face... ...A completely hostile world... ...The present... ...Division of the populations... ...Of the world... ...Approximately in the ratio... ...Of one to two... ...750 millions... ...Under Communist direction... ...And approximately... ...A billion and a half... ...Under non-Communist direction... ...But of the billion and a half... ...Who are under... ...Non-Communist direction... ...About three quarters... ...Of the billion... ...Are in... ...Asia... ...Asia Minor... ...The islands of the Pacific... ...And therefore... ...Aside from natural resources... ...Are... ...Not of great... ...Immediate... ...Military importance... ...If the... ...250 million people... ...Of Western Europe... ...Were added to the... ...750 million... ...Under Communist control... ...And the some... ...250 million... ...Under Communist control... ...In Europe proper... ...We would have on our side... ...The 153 millions... ...Of the United States... ...Plus the 13 millions... ...Of Canada... ...Plus possibly... ...The... ...40 millions... ...Of Mexico... ...And the Caribbean... ...Or a total... ...Of... ...Not greatly... ...In excess... ...Of 200 million people... ...So that... ...From the standpoint... ...Of population... ...We would... ...Have the odds... ...Very much against it... ...From the standpoint... ...Of industrial resources... ...We would be about... ...On an even... ...Basis... ...As you know... ...The... ...Steel capacity... ...Of the United States... ...Is the present... ...100 million tons... ...A year... ...Steel capacity... ...Of Russia... ...Is 35 million tons... ...A year... ...The steel capacity... ...Of Western Europe... ...Is 65 million tons... ...A year... ...As long as... ...We have... ...Western Europe... ...On our side... ...We can... ...Outproduce... ...The Russians... ...And I suppose... ...Steel is the most... ...Sensitive index... ...In the ratio of... ...Approximately... ...5 to 1... ...But... ...If Western Europe... ...Passes into... ...Russian hands... ...The... ...Steel capacity... ...Of the Communist... ...Block... ...Will then be... ...Approximately... ...Equal... ...To our steel capacity... ...The shipbuilding... ...Capacity... ...Of Europe... ...Will be... ...In excess... ...Of... ...Certainly... ...Our present... ...So the first... ...Simple thesis... ...And it's... ...Very trite... ...And very obvious... ...Is that from the... ...Standpoint of... ...Population... ...And industrial... ...Resources... ...We cannot afford... ...To let Western Europe... ...Move into Russian hands... ...What about the... ...Economic aspects... ...Of Europe... ...We of course... ...Do not depend upon... ...Europe for... ...Any vital... ...WAR materials... ...It is... ...South America... ...Asia... ...And to some degree... ...Africa... ...So-called... ...Tropical... ...Regions of the world... ...Which we need... ...For... ...WAR materials... ...But a third... ...Of our exports... ...Go to... ...Western Europe... ...And... ...Our three great... ...Export crops... ...Upon which... ...The prosperity... ...Of the South... ...And the Middle West... ...Largely depend upon... ...Europe as a market... ...A third of our... ...Cotton is exported... ...Most of which goes... ...To the cotton mills... ...Of England... ...In the continent... ...Roughly a third... ...Of our wheat... ...Most of it... ...For Western Europe... ...A quarter of our tobacco... ...So that if... ...Western Europe... ...Were to fall... ...In the Communist hands... ...These... ...Markets... ...Our exports... ...Would be... ...Shot... ...And we would have... ...Great economic distress... ...In this country... ...If they are held... ...And if in addition... ...We can build up a... ...Greater degree... ...Of economic unity... ...Metween the United States... ...And Western Europe... ...So that our alliance... ...Is not merely a military one... ...But is also an economic one... ...Then the capacities... ...For the expansion of our exports... ...Will be almost unlimited... ...The United States and Canada... ...Are the natural granaries... ...For the industrial... ...Regions of Europe... ...The agricultural... ...Factories... ...Agricultural machinery... ...Factories... ...Of this country... ...Can produce agricultural... ...Machinery... ...cheaply... ...And efficiently... ...And could be used... ...To build up... ...The agriculture... ...Certainly of Germany... ...Possibly to some degree... ...Of Western Europe... ...The machine tool industry... ...Of this country... ...Could find a great... ...Market... ...In Europe... ...The electrical machinery... ...Of this country... ...Could find great expansion... ...And perhaps... ...If we can become... ...Strong enough allies... ...Wedded... ...Cosely enough... ...To each other... ...We can create... ...A great economic system... ...Which will span... ...The Atlantic... ...And make possible... ...International division... ...Of labor... ...On a very wide scale... ...To the advantage... ...Of both countries... ...And all people... ...But I do not wish... ...To be... ...Turely materialistic... ...I do not wish... ...To speak... ...Entirely in terms... ...of military strength... ...Industrial potential... ...Increased military... ...Prosperity... ...It is certainly also... ...True that... ...Western Europe... ...And the United States... ...Are with all our differences... ...A cultural unity... ...It is these sections... ...of the world... ...Where we have... ...developed political democracy... ...and political freedom... ...Great... ...Religions... ...Of Christianity... ...Roman Catholicism... ...And Protestantism... ...Are the basic faiths... ...And do not... ...As a matter of fact... ...Greetly extend... ...Outside... ...Of Western Europe... ...And the United States... ...Except in the case... ...Of Catholicism... ...Of South America... ...And the Latin American country... ...So... ...To repeat... ...I do not think... ...We can take lightly... ...The danger... ...That Western Europe... ...Might fall under Communist hands... ...And if that... ...Were to happen... ...It would be a calamity... ...For this country... ...Of the first magnitude... ...Because... ...If we take... ...Total... ...Communist military strength... ...Of approximately... ...175 divisions... ...Plus... ...60 divisions... ...In the European satellites... ...Exclusive of the Chinese army... ...We have a total... ...Of 235 divisions... ...Against which... ...The... ...Countries of Western Europe... ...Probably could not put... ...More than 15... ...In the field... ...And then they would have to... ...Draw upon... ...So-called... ...Territorials... ...And the French reserve division... ...So... ...First... ...To repeat... ...It's finally important... ...That Western Europe... ...Should not fall under... ...Communist hands... ...Then the question comes... ...How can it be defended? Some have advanced the idea... ...That... ...It can be defended primarily... ...By... ...Our contributing... ...Air and sea power... ...But not any... ...Appreciable number... ...Of land troops... ...That the defense... ...Western Europe... ...On the land... ...Should be either... ...Predominantly... ...Or... ...As in some cases... ...As this is advanced... ...Exclusively... ...The function of Western Europe... ...Well I would say... ...That the defense... ...Western Europe... ...On the land... ...Should be predominantly... ...Concern... ...Of Western Europe... ...But it should not be... ...Exclusively... ...Concern... ...Of Western Europe... ...In the first place... ...It seems probable... ...That we would not have... ...Air superiority... ...If any attack... ...On Western Europe... ...Were to occur... ...Within the next... ...Two or three years... ...The... ...Russian superiority... ...In tactical aviation... ...Is so great... ...That it will take... ...An appreciable amount of time... ...Before we can build... ...Our air forces up... ...So that... ...We could launch them... ...Against an advancing... ...Russian or... ...Satellite... ...Advance... ...Through Germany... ...And through Western Europe... ...You may say... ...That... ...It is the fault... ...Of the administration... ...That it has not... ...Built up the... ...Air Force... ...Or you can say... ...That it is the fault... ...Of the Air Force... ...That it has not... ...Developed tactical aviation... ...And is concentrated... ...Instead on strategic bombing... ...Or you can say... ...That it is inherent... ...In the... ...Desire of the... ...American people... ...Not spend... ...Very much on... ...And to... ...Try to... ...Economize... ...It matters of defense... ...Whatever the... ...Explanation may be... ...Certainly it is true... ...That we would not have... ...Air superiority... ...In the immediate future... ...And that therefore... ...The... ...Prospect that is held out... ...That we can defend... ...Western Europe... ...From the air... ...Seems to me... ...To be fallacious... ...In the second place... ...With... ...Even if we did... ...Control the air... ...At least with... ...Such weapons... ...As have been... ...Developed and put into... ...Practice... ...Up to the present... ...The lesson of Korea... ...Seems to be clear... ...That air power... ...Cannot stop... ...An advancing army... ...We have had... ...Dominance... ...In the air... ...Over Korea... ...Ever since the beginning... ...Of hostilities there... ...We controlled the air... ...When the North Koreans... ...Surged down... ...From... ...Cross the 38th parallel... ...Down through... ...Central... ...Corea... ...And almost... ...In the air... ...Pusan... ...And yet... ...Our air power... ...Was not able... ...To turn back... ...The... ...North Korean armies... ...We similarly... ...Had dominance... ...Over... ...Air dominance... ...Over Korea... ...When the Chinese armies... ...Attacked... ...In November... ...And in December... ...And while our air force... ...Did extremely well... ...It was not able... ...To stop... ...The Chinese land armies... ...And... ...Most of us have talked... ...Probably... ...With people who... ...Who have returned... ...From Korea... ...Everyone with whom... ...I have talked... ...Has said that... ...That is certainly... ...One of the lessons... ...Of the Korean War... ...That aviation... ...In itself... ...Cannot stop... ...Ground troops... ...Now it is quite possible... ...That... ...We may... ...Be able to... ...Deliver atomic... ...Bombs... ...In such... ...Mineute... ...Quantities... ...As to... ...Stop land armies... ...In the future... ...That is possible... ...That we can localize... ...The effect... ...Of an atomic... ...Explosion... ...So that it can be used... ...Against a division... ...A corps... ...Or an advancing army... ...But... ...I think... ...We shouldn't depend... ...On these... ...Possible Buck Rogers... ...Developments... ...If they have not... ...Yet been tried out... ...And have not yet been demonstrated... ...It seems to be unsafe... ...To... ...Place... ...Our reliance... ...Upon... ...Air power... ...In the face of the Korean experience... ...And not... ...And we should not depend... ...Upon weapons... ...Which have not yet... ...Been developed... ...Or tried out... ...The scientist always... ...Wants to abolish the infantry... ...And to... ...To transform a war... ...Into a push-button... ...Affair... ...In which... ...Science is dominant... ...But in every... ...War that has occurred... ...It's the human spirit... ...That is ultimately tested... ...And it is the land armies... ...And the infantrymen... ...Who ultimately... ...Make the difference... ...Between success... ...Between success... ...And failure... ...So... ...I would like to advance... ...The thesis... ...That... ...The continent of Europe... ...Cannot be defended... ...By air power... ...Alone... ...Certainly not by our air power... ...In its present form... ...And that if it is to be... ...Successfully defended... ...There will have to be... ...A large army... ...A large... ...Well equipped army... ...Fighting to defend... ...That area... ...Well... ...You asked... ...Why should not... ...Europe itself... ...Furnish... ...Exclusively the army... ...Is it not their territory... ...Is it not their population... ...Which... ...Will be attacked... ...Invaded... ...Conquered... ...Should it not therefore... ...Be their... ...Exclusive responsibility... ...As I have said... ...I think it should be... ...Their predominant responsibility... ...But I do not believe... ...That it can be... ...Their exclusive responsibility... ...From the prudential reason... ...Alone... ...I think you will find... ...That... ...Western Europe... ...Will probably be willing... ...To fight... ...If it feels... ...That it has a fair chance... ...Of success... ...But they... ...Will believe... ...That their chance... ...Of success... ...Will be much greater... ...If American troops... ...Are fighting... ...Alongside... ...Of their troops... ...Rather than... ...Remaining... ...In the rear... ...Protecting... ...The British Isles... ...But not... ...Engaging... ...In any struggles... ...On the continent... ...My good friend... ...Senator Taft... ...You'll forgive me... ...If I... ...Try to quote him... ...In advance... ...On this... ...My good friend... ...Senator Taft... ...On other occasions... ...Has advocated... ...This doctrine... ...Of... ...Defending Europe... ...By... ...Air and Sea Power... ...That's fundamentally... ...As I understand it... ...The same policy... ...Which the... ...Which Great Britain... ...Adopted... ...In relationship... ...With the continent... ...For at least... ...Two centuries... ...In the time... ...Of Queen Anne... ...Particularly... ...However... ...In the Napoleonic War... ...And at the outbreak... ...Of the First World War... ...Though wars... ...Ware much less... ...Destructive... ...In those days... ...Thin in these... ...It did not arouse... ...Very much enthusiasm... ...For Great Britain... ...On the part... ...Of the French people... ...The French people... ...Felt... ...That... ...Great Britain... ...Was pushing them... ...Into the forefront... ...Letting them... ...Take the Buffets... ...And... ...And... ...Remaining... ...Discreetly... ...A safe position... ...And it was this policy... ...Which won... ...For Great Britain... ...The title... ...On the continent... ...Of Papidius Albion... ...It put such a strain... ...Indeed... ...Upon the... ...Franko-Pritish... ...Relationship... ...That... ...In the preparations... ...For World War II... ...The French were insisting... ...That there should be... ...Pritish divisions... ...On the continent... ...Of Europe... ...In the very beginning... ...And while... ...I suppose... ...The full diplomatic... ...And military... ...Negotiations... ...Of the 20s... ...And 30s... ...Are not known... ...Certainly... ...The French... ...Constantly... ...Inisted... ...That at least... ...The British... ...Should be there... ...Initially... ...At the trouble... ...So... ...I think... ...It's quite apparent... ...Although... ...This may be... ...Question... ...That... ...The French... ...And people... ...Have their spirit... ...of resistance... ...Very much... ...Diminished... ...If they felt... ...That both... ...Great Britain... ...And the United States... ...Would remain... ...Behind the lines... ...If however... ...They have a pledge... ...That... ...Great Britain... ...Will help... ...Beer part... ...Of the initial... ...Shark... ...Even though... ...A minor... ...And therefore... ...Give them an... ...Assurance... ...That they're... ...Going to be... ...In the struggle... ...For keeps... ...Then their... ...Will to resist... ...Will naturally... ...Be greatly... ...Heightened... ...In February... ...And early March... ...Now... ...I have always been... ...Somewhat puzzled... ...By... ...Doctrines... ...Of... ...Such men... ...As Mr. Hoover... ...Who I believe... ...In this matter... ...Gos much... ...Has a much more... ...Restricted point of view... ...Than... ...The Son of the Death... ...That it is enough... ...For us to... ...Hold island bases... ...Off continents... ...And that... ...This will give us... ...A sure protection... ...From which we can... ...Lawks... ...Air attacks... ...I do not... ...See how... ...We could expect... ...To hold... ...Great Britain... ...For long... ...If... ...The continent of Europe... ...Were to be lost... ...To the Russians... ...Russians... ...Undoubtedly... ...Have developed... ...Guided missiles... ...Far beyond the point... ...Which the Germans... ...Have developed them... ...And they could... ...Set up their... ...Launching platforms... ...From the Channel... ...And with the range... ...Which guided missiles... ...Now have... ...It seemed to me... ...That... ...They would virtually... ...Be able... ...To compel... ...A surrender... ...By Great Britain... ...When Great Britain... ...Did surrender... ...That... ...We would lose... ...These air bases... ...Upon which Mr. Hoover... ...And others... ...Seemed to depend... ...Therefore that we... ...Need... ...A... ...Peripheral... ...Of land... ...On the continent of Europe... ...Protect... ...The very island bases... ...Which we need... ...For air... ...Or for an aviation attack... ...I suddenly remember... ...That I... ...Omitted perhaps... ...The most obvious point of all... ...In this discussion... ...That I've been giving... ...Namely... ...That you cannot expect... ...The Western Europeans... ...To have much enthusiasm... ...If we permit them... ...To be conquered... ...In the first place... ...And then bomb them... ...To pieces... ...After they have been... ...Conquered... ...As a reward... ...For their behavior... ...And yet that is... ...Precisely... ...The consequence... ...Of those who advocate... ...Air power alone... ...Well... ...If Western Europe... ...Should be defended... ...And if land armies... ...As well as air... ...And sea power... ...Needed for its defense... ...Question... ...Next question comes... ...Is obviously... ...Whether we are being asked... ...To bear disproportionate... ...Share of the burden... ...Nobody quite knows... ...What the Brussels Agreement... ...Provided for... ...But... ...We know... ...From the Statement... ...To the former Prime Minister... ...Plevin... ...That under it... ...France is committed... ...To furnish... ...Twenty divisions... ...Probably... ...Great Britain... ...Committed to furnish... ...Approximately... ...Eight divisions... ...The Low Countries... ...Perhaps... ...Five to six divisions... ...Statement... ...To General Marshall... ...Before the... ...Armed Services Committee... ...Was that the United States... ...Is committed to furnish... ...Six divisions... ...That makes a total... ...Of forty divisions... ...Excluding... ...Italy... ...And West Germany... ...Um... ...It is probably... ...Not too far... ...From the point... ...To say... ...That... ...It is planned... ...To... ...Build up... ...A force... ...From fifty... ...To sixty divisions... ...At a minimum... ...With the target date... ...Perhaps in fifty-three... ...Although I hope... ...It will be... ...At the end of fifty-two... ...And our contribution... ...Of six divisions... ...Out of this total... ...Would therefore... ...Be from one-eighth... ...To one-tenth... ...Of the total... ...We bearing in addition... ...The equipment... ...Of a number of divisions... ...Particularly... ...The French divisions... ...I would suggest... ...Therefore... ...That this is not... ...A disproportionate... ...Share... ...Of the... ...Initial... ...Amount... ...On the contrary... ...It would seem to be... ...A modest share... ...I had thought... ...That... ...Probably... ...We could go up... ...To a ratio... ...Of one-to-four... ...Or one-to-five... ...Which would mean... ...That we would contribute... ...One-fifth... ...One-sixth... ...Of the total... ...And therefore... ...I had thought... ...That... ...Under the Brussels Agreement... ...We would probably... ...Go up to... ...Ten divisions... ...That did not... ...Seem excessive... ...To me... ...Although... ...I did not want us... ...To contribute... ...And do not want us... ...To contribute... ...A larger fraction... ...Than this amount... ...One-fourth... ...Or one-fifth... ...To one-sixth... ...Of the total... ...But we have a large... ...Margin of safety... ...To operate on... ...And therefore... ...After General Marshall's... ...Pledge... ...Or statement... ...That present plans... ...Claw for only... ...Six divisions... ...I ceased to advocate... ...Placing a... ...Ratio... ...In the resolution... ...Approving... ...The sending... ...Of troops... ...To Europe... ...And then... ...In the... ...In the... ...The... ...In the... ...The... ...Other countries... ...Are doing... ...Their share... ...Certainly... ...Under the... ...Brussels agreement... ...They are pledged... ...To do their share... ...The question is... ...Have they given... ...Any present... ...Evidence... ...Of doing their share... ...In January... ...I collected... ...Some figures... ...On this point... ...Which I believe... ...Is... ...Infinancially accurate... ...I shall repeat them... ...And try to... ...Bring them as much... ...As possible... ...Up to date... ...In all these... ...Comparisons... ...We want to take... ...The... ...Relative... ...Burden... ...And not... ...Merely the... ...Absolute amount... ...Of the contribution... ...And one of the best... ...Measures of... ...Relative... ...Burden... ...In terms of... ...Armed forces... ...Is the number... ...Of men... ...Per 1000... ...Population... ...Which are... ...Who are in the... ...As of... ...The end of March... ...We had... ...18... ...Men... ...Out of every... ...1000... ...Population... ...Who were... ...In uniform... ...And interestingly enough... ...That was the... ...Precise ratio... ...In Great Britain... ...And in France... ...As well... ...18 to the... ...Thousand... ...So that they were... ...On an equality... ...With us... ...In Italy... ...The ratio was only... ...One third of this... ...About six... ...To the thousand... ...But that was because... ...The Italian Peace Treaty... ...In itself... ...Placed a ceiling... ...On the maximum size... ...Of the Italian forces... ...The smaller nations... ...Of Western Europe... ...Had a ratio of only... ...10 to the thousand... ...And I think it is true... ...That they and the British... ...Dominions... ...To date... ...And I included in this... ...All the British... ...Dominions... ...Australia, New Zealand... ...Canada... ...Have been coasting along... ...On the strength... ...Of the so-called... ...Great Powers... ...If they are to make a... ...Proportionate contribution... ...They should greatly... ...Increase... ...The number of men... ...Under arms... ...Belgium and Holland... ...And Denmark... ...And Australia... ...New Zealand... ...And Canada... ...It is always somewhat... ...Ungracious however... ...For the big nations... ...To urge the... ...Small nations... ...To arm in this fashion... ...But... ...There is... ...An obligation upon them... ...But the point I want to make... ...Is this... ...That... ...As of January... ...They had as many men... ...Under arms... ...In relationship to their... ...Population... ...As we have... ...Indeed... ...If you were to take... ...The French... ...Reserve forces... ...Men who had... ...Served their period... ...Of compulsory military service... ...And had passed... ...Into the reserve... ...And there were... ...A million and a half... ...Of those... ...And formed in... ...Reserve divisions... ...Though poorly equipped... ...The French ratio... ...Was 50 to the thousand... ...As compared to our 18... ...I was basing... ...My figures... ...On two and three quarter... ...Million men... ...Under arms... ...As of the end... ...Of January... ...Of course... ...We hope that by... ...Summer... ...And is planned by... ...Summer to have... ...Roughly three and a half... ...Million men under arms... ...That would be... ...23 to the thousand... ...But there is every evidence... ...That... ...When the French... ...Add 15 more divisions... ...On the continent of Europe... ...Which is their plan... ...The French ratio... ...Will exceed... ...23 to the thousand... ...And that the planned... ...Increase in the size... ...Of the British forces... ...Which runs from... ...100,000 to 200,000... ...The total men... ...Will bring them very close... ...To 23 to the thousand... ...Perhaps 21 to the thousand... ...So that I think we can say... ...That the major powers... ...Are going up together... ...In the ratio of... ...Men in the armed services... ...And that... ...We are not being asked to bear... ...We are not being asked to bear... ...A disproportionate share... ...Of the... ...Of the manpower burden... ...What about the financial... ...Support... ...What about the money contributions... ...Which though... ...Less important than men... ...Are still... ...Extremely important... ...Well... ...I've made some comparisons... ...There too... ...Taking the expenditures... ...For national armament... ...And figuring them as a... ...Percentage of... ...Gross national product... ...I would prefer to take... ...Net national income... ...As a better absolute measure... ...But as a relative measure... ...I think it's alright... ...To use... ...Gross national product... ...For the various countries... ...Last year... ...The year 1950... ...All of these countries... ...Were probably spending... ...With exception of Italy... ...Or rather we should say... ...U.K. ...And France... ...Were probably spending... ...A somewhat... ...Larger fraction... ...Of their national income... ...For purely armament purposes... ...Than were we... ...At present... ...We are spending... ...At the rate of 25 billion... ...A year... ...Which is... ...About one-twelfth... ...Of our gross national product... ...Or... ...A little over eight percent... ...Of the total... ...The ratio... ...For France... ...And the French budget... ...9.7 percent... ...And for the United Kingdom... ...8.0 percent... ...The French budget... ...May be slightly padded... ...For military expenditure... ...But... ...I think one can safely say... ...That the French... ...As of this moment... ...Are spending... ...About the same proportion... ...Of their national income... ...That we are spending... ...And the British... ...Are probably spending... ...As large a fraction... ...Of their national income... ...We of course... ...Intend to double... ...This rate of expenditure... ...From 25 billions a year... ...To a rate of 50 billions... ...A year... ...And that 50 billions... ...Will include... ...The sums... ...Which we will... ...Spend for the rearmament... ...Of Western Europe... ...Reequipping... ...French divisions... ...This will be one sixth... ...Of the gross national product... ...Assuming that... ...To be a constant magnitude... ...The British... ...Budget is going to increase... ...But... ...According to my figures... ...It will not increase... ...Much beyond 11%... ...Of the gross national product... ...The French may get up to... ...11%... ...This is the first point... ...This is the first figure... ...Which I've turned up... ...Indicating a greater degree... ...Of sacrifice... ...On our part... ...Than the major... ...European nations... ...But let us see... ...Let us go into that... ...A bit more... ...And see whether it really is... ...A greater degree of sacrifice... ...The... ...Per capita... ...Real income... ...Of the United States... ...In terms of American dollars... ...Is about $1,500... ...Per year... ...The per capita... ...Income... ...In terms of American dollars... ...In Great Britain... ...Is about $750... ...A year... ...And in France... ...Something over $450... ...A year... ...Or in other words... ...Our per capita income... ...In terms of real purchasing power... ...Is about twice... ...The per capita... ...Purchasing power of Great Britain... ...And at least three times... ...Possible and probably more... ...The per capita real income... ...In terms of France... ...Well... ...In this country... ...We've come to accept the fact... ...Of the progressive income tax... ...That people with a... ...Larger real income... ...Can bear... ...A larger... ...Percentage tax... ...Without necessarily... ...Any greater... ...Psychic sacrifice... ...I submit therefore... ...That in view of the fact... ...That our real income per capita... ...Is twice that of Great Britain... ...Three times that of France... ...It is not disproportionate... ...For us to spend one-sixth... ...Of this per capita income... ...On our month... ...As compared to one-ninth... ...In Great Britain... ...And in France... ...In short... ...The conclusion to which I come... ...At least... ...Is that in view of the importance... ...Of the stake... ...In view of the... ...In adequacy of air... ...And sea power alone... ...In view of the contributions... ...Which Europe is already making... ...And to which Europe is pledged... ...Under the Brussels Agreement... ...That it is proper for us... ...To send these four added divisions... ...To Europe... ...And to stand beside them... ...If a land attack... ...Occurs... ...Now... ...The terms of reference... ...Which Mr. Douglas... ...Gave me... ...Were that we were to discuss... ...The relationships between Europe... ...And the United States... ...Primarily... ...In fact... ...There was nothing else mentioned... ...In the covering letter... ...And covering telegram... ...But I know how impossible it is... ...To confine any... ...Discussion of foreign affairs... ...At this time... ...Purely to Western Europe... ...And perhaps this is all right... ...Although it's sometimes rather difficult... ...To deal with... ...Because... ...As you try to discuss one subject... ...You find... ...Other parts of the globe... ...Being brought in... ...But since it is a global struggle... ...I think perhaps... ...It's appropriate... ...To say a few words at least... ...About Asia... ...I want to say... ...That this program of defending... ...Helping to defend... ...Western Europe... ...In no sense implies... ...Any abandonment of Asia... ...I'm not here to make... ...Party speech... ...Or to defend... ...The present administration... ...I like to think for myself... ...And I... ...Like to believe at least... ...That I take my positions... ...Independently... ...Of the line of my party... ...But I think it is appropriate... ...To point out... ...That the administration... ...Which with the aid of... ...Many splendid Republicans... ...Has... ...Come... ...To the defense of Western Europe... ...Is also the same administration... ...Which came to the defense of Korea... ...And I... ...Though that act was questioned at the time... ...Both on its constitutionality... ...And... ...Afterwards on its wisdom... ...It still seems to me... ...To have been a fundamentally... ...Wise procedure... ...Because if we had not... ...Done so... ...Inevitably... ...All of Asia would have fallen... ...And... ...The feeling of discouragement... ...And of defeat... ...Would have leaked over... ...Into Europe... ...And it might well have been... ...The spark precipitating... ...And advance... ...In Europe... ...We have achieved great things... ...In Korea... ...At real cost... ...To be sure... ...We have destroyed... ...The North Korean army... ...We are... ...Rapidly chewing up... ...The Chinese... ...Communist army... ...We have... ...Saved... ...Indochina... ...At least with the present... ...From attack... ...And preserve the Malay... ...Peninsula... ...We are... ...Splitting... ...The Chinese people away... ...From the... ...Chinese Communist government... ...And... ...From their Russian masters... ...And we... ...Are vindicating... ...The principle... ...Of collective security... ...The mistakes made... ...In the military conduct... ...Of the war... ...I wish that... ...The other members... ...Of the United Nations... ...Had stood beside us... ...And stood beside the United Nations... ...Somewhat more loyally... ...Both in their contributions... ...Of troops... ...And in their willingness... ...To apply economic sanctions... ...To the aggressors... ...But on the whole... ...The job is being done... ...I do not wish to... ...Launch a discussion... ...As to the... ...Precise... ...Steps... ...Next steps... ...To be taken in Asia... ...I think that's... ...Outside the... ...Terms of reference... ...Which Mr. Dugtus... ...Gave us... ...But I do wish to see... ...Say more... ...Stormily... ...That it does not... ...In any sense... ...Mean... ...That the adoption... ...Of a strong policy... ...In Europe... ...Does not in any sense... ...Mean the abandonment... ...Of Asia... ...On the contrary... ...The two... ...Are... ...Faces of the same policy... ...Which is to resist aggression... ...Wherever it occurs... ...Provided only the two conditions... ...of men... ...In the first place... ...That the place is accessible... ...We... ...Have not taken up... ...The cause of Tibet... ...Tibet's too... ...Inaccessible place... ...To reach... ...And provided in the second place... ...That other nations... ...Make a substantial... ...And an equitable... ...Contribution... ...To the common defense... ...I think that's the... ...American policy... ...I think it's the policy... ...Which the American people... ...Are agreeing... ...I think it is the... ...Crystalization... ...Which is coming out... ...Of the... ...So-called... ...Great Debate... ...Which started in Europe... ...And then moved to Asia... ...And which tomorrow... ...Who knows... ...May transfer itself... ...To Asia Minor... ...But... ...It's... ...In this... ...Typically American process... ...We're getting at... ...A meeting of minds... ...In a sense... ...What I've been saying... ...Tonight... ...Seems to me... ...Somewhat old hat... ...That... ...Is a policy... ...To which the great... ...Mass of Americans... ...Have agreed... ...I think we're now... ...Rapidly coming... ...To an agreement on Asia... ...Quite obvious... ...That the American government... ...Is now committed... ...And I approve it... ...And have urged it... ...As a matter of fact... ...For some months... ...Committed to a program... ...Of trying to... ...Overthrow... ...The present... ...Chinese Communist government... ...But to overthrow it... ...Not by... ...Landing troops... ...Or bombing... ...Chinese civilians... ...But by... ...Giving aid... ...To those forces... ...Inside of China... ...Which are willing... ...To take up arms... ...In defense... ...Of themselves... ...So that... ...We will be a liberating force... ...Not an imperialistic force... ...Now as I say... ...I think the... ...American people... ...Are coming to these... ...Common decisions... ...And... ...One part... ...Of this attempt... ...To reach a synthesis... ...I personally... ...Welcome... ...This assembly... ...Express my gratitude... ...And having been... ...Promitted to make... ...My poor... ...And inadequate... ...Contribution... ...I now cede the... ...Stage to my brilliant... ...Able colleague... ...Senator Pat... ...Thank you...
