Pray somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in-more. What for? I've got no luck on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the drugs from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no luck on the door, that's the way to be. Do you complain? I've got no luck on the door, that's the way to be. I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me.
