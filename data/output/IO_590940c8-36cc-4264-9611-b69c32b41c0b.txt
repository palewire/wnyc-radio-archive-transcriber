Conceived Plan It becomes Evident It became Evident to Me shortly After I Became Secretary Of the Treasury In 1946 That the Revenue Service Had suffered Severely Due to The conditions Under which It had Had to Expand Under Wartime Restrictions And Developments There had Been a Great Increase In the Number Of tax Returns Filed And the Amount Of revenue Collected Many Expert Employees Had been Called Into The Armed Forces New Tax Legislation Had been Enacted The Workload Had Increased Enormously And the Bureau Had not Been Able To Modernize Its Operations Due To Shortage Of Up-to-date Equipment We Immediately Set About To Improve Management Methods And Achieve Greater Operating Efficiency But Every Change Had to Be Made Without Interrupting The Services Continued Task Of Collecting Revenues And Enforcing The Tax Law Conferences Were Held With Many Groups Of Revenue Officials As Early As October 1946 To Discuss Problems And Suggest Solutions A Work Simplification Program Was Set Up As A Means Of Enlisting The Aid Of Every Employee Towards Improved Efficiency Task Forces Of Key Officials Were Established To Make Specific Surveys And Reports Congressional Recommendations Were Given The Closest Attention A Firm Of Management Engineers Was Employed To Analyze Operations Of The Service And Suggest Other Improvements The Alcohol Tax And Tobacco Tax Divisions Of The Bureau Were Consolidated In This Fashion For Six Years We Have Been Gradually Reorganizing The Bureau Of Internal Revenue Until We Have Reached This Final Step In A Long Series Of Actions Taken By The Treasury Department To Improve And Streamline The Federal Tax Collection System The President's Reorganization Plan Number One Of 1952 Is The Capstone Of This Progressive Development In Placing The Plans In
