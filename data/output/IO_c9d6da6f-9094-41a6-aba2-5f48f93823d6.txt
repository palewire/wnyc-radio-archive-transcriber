So wherever I've got information they receive and thank you for showing us your puppy something Today after itيمembre. Here we go. Once again, your city station is in touch with Con Edison, and here is a spokesman to give us the latest on the power situation since the storm has abated. Go ahead, sir. At this time, we're able to report partial restoration of service. In the Bronx, you'll remember, we had an estimated 47,000 customers without electricity. 8,000 of those customers had been restored this morning, and leaving 29,000 still without service. Would you care to say, sir, just when service will be restored to that borough completely, or have you no definite idea? Well, we have announced earlier this morning that we expect to have service restored to practically all our customers by tonight. It's impossible to be more specific than that at this time. In the borough of Brooklyn, where we had 260,000 customers without service, we have restored electricity to nearly half of those, leaving 132,000 still without service at 10 o'clock this morning. In the borough of Queens, where 100,000 were 100,000 were affected by company estimates, there are still 71,000 without service at 10 o'clock. Of course, we have emergency crews in the field, and are mending every effort to restore service as promptly as possible. We had a message before from you concerning action to be taken by the people of the city of New York who are subscribers to Con Edison. Well, we would like to repeat that it would help us a great deal if customers would report their lack of service only once. Every time a report is made, a ticket is filled out, and it would increase our paperwork if customers called more than once. Ladies and gentlemen, you've been listening to a report from Con Edison on the power situation in New York at the rest of the day. We will keep you fully informed. The I. The I. The I. Your city station, WNYC, operating on an assigned frequency of 830 kilocycles by authority of the Federal Communications Commission, is now compelled to leave the air. The voice of New York City has been at your service, bringing you the finest in music, the latest news, and public service programs of special interest. We invite you to tune to WNYC-FM at 93.9 megacycles on your FM dial for other fine programs. Your city station operates under the direct supervision of Mayor Vincent R. Impelletari, with Seymour N. Siegel as director. And so, until 7 o'clock tomorrow morning, the voice of New York City bids you all good night. Ladies and gentlemen, our national anthem. Thank you. Thank you. SCREEN Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
