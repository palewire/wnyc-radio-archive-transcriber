Everybody seems happy and bright like the day itself, and well, it's a great day for the Irish and it's a great day for history, because when the little people emerge, there's nothing to worry about. In a few moments, you'll hear the brilliant voices of the Police Glee Club, raised in song here in the Council Chamber in City Hall, and Mr. Whelan is about ready now to inform the Mayor that he has brought another distinguished guest to this great and wonderful building, City Hall. Mr. Whelan. Will you please be in order? The Police Glee Club will open the proceedings with the national anthem. I'll sing you a song, a soldier's song, with chilly rousing chorus, as round our blazing miles we throng, the starry heavens all of us, impatient for the coming fight, while we await the morning's light, till in the silence of the night, we'll chant the soldier's song. 00� L On our ancient style and shall shelter the despot or the slave. Tonight we man the barn of will, in Aaron's courts come for a will. With cannons roar and rifles fill, we'll chant the soldiers song. Oh say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming. Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, all the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming. And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, it proved through the night that our flag was still there. Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, O'er the lands of the free and the home of the brave. And now Mr. Whalen will make the introductions. The mayor of the city of New York is receiving the foreign minister of the Irish Republic, the Honorable Seen McBride. Mr. Whalen. Mayor O'Dwyer, it's a great privilege and honor for me to present to you the minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Ireland, Sean McBride. Mr. Whalen, our distinguished visitor, ladies and gentlemen who have come here to take part in this official welcome to the minister for foreign affairs of the Republic of Ireland. Grover, as I see it, I regret to say that there is not a Republic of Ireland yet. As a Republic of Ireland, as a Republic of Ireland was built by God as one full completed plot. Foreign domination has split a corner away and it still dominates it. And until we get them out of there, we won't have a Republic of Ireland, but we'll get it someday. Thank you. Thank you. Jaws of death to procure and to preserve human liberty. In no occasion until today, except once, did I have the privilege of welcoming the representative of a people who have kept up, without exception, of one year, over 700 years of continuous fight for liberty at home and almost as many years in the fight for the liberty of peoples throughout the world. Speaking as an American today, I will be forgiven by freedom-loving peoples everywhere. If I have a great pride in the history of the world. If I have a great pride in the history of my people in the fight for freedom, and that I have that pride, an opportunity to express that pride here today, in bidding welcome to a youngster who already has served not only liberty in his homeland, but liberty in foreign lands, who has come from a bloodstream on his mother's side and on his father's side where there was no limit to the distance they went in procuring liberty at home and elsewhere. I have the privilege today, and I feel it keenly, I wish I could rise to the dignity that this occasion requires from me, to give to Sean McBride now, for him and for his people, today and over the 700 years, a welcome that their sacrifices for liberty demand and require. I wish I could say to you, Sean, how happy I am as mayor of this city to welcome you, and to give you on behalf of myself and this city the heartiest welcome that we can give, the highest hopes for your great aspirations, the prayers and the wishes that what your people have fought for that they will one day gain in whole, that there will be no partition of that native land that so many of us look back to with such sentimental interest and glory. Sean, I hope you do enjoy your visit to the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you. I feel for the welcome you have given me today here. I will take this welcome as being a welcome intended to be conveyed to the Irish people. It has been my privilege to be here in the United States when the Republic of Ireland Act came into operation. I felt that there were so many bonds of blood and of friendship between the people of Ireland and the people of the United States that it was only right I should be here on this occasion to tell the people of the United States of the position of our country. Quite apart from the great many ties of blood and friendship that exist between our two nations, probably greater ties than exist between any other two nations in the world, we have a common tradition. That is, the people of the United States and the people of Ireland have a common tradition of fighting for liberty and for justice. We first established a republic in Ireland as far back as 1798. That republic was established then by Presbyterians from Belfast. In our generation, it was again proclaimed in arms in 1916. So that the coming into operation of the Republic of Ireland Act was not in effect for the first time establishing a republic in Ireland. That had been done before. It was merely securing international recognition for the republic. Mr. Mayor has referred very kindly to the fact that we have not yet reached our ultimate goal. Our claim is a very simple one. We assert that the form of government in Ireland is a matter for the Irish people without any outside interference. We claim as much right to select our government and conduct our affairs as any other free nation. That is, a fundamental democratic right. It is the fundamental democratic right upon which most other democratic rights rest. The right to national self-determination. No country in Ireland has more clearly defined boundaries, a more distinct national history, or a more homogeneous population than Ireland. And we claim that Britain's interference in our affairs, Britain's occupation of a portion of our country, is a denial of ordinary democratic rights. I hope and I trust that that cannot long survive in the terror. That in the democratic world, but on this side of the iron curtain, at least, it should be recognized by all freedom-loving nations. That the Irish nation and the Irish people are as entitled to the exercise of democratic rights as any other nation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. We have just heard the reply of Sean McBride, Foreign Minister of the Republic of Ireland, and the Mayor of the City of New York. And now, Mr. Whelan has an announcement. Mr. Whelan. We will conclude the program with a few numbers by the Police Glee Club. And if the Glee Club knows what they're about today, the Police Glee Club, they'll do it better than they've ever done it before. because Mayor O'Dwyer will be listening to them more carefully now than he ever listened before, I'm sure.
