WNYC concert orchestra conducted by Macklin Marrow is heard in a rarely played work today. New York City's own station, WNYC. The radio production workshop of the College of the City of New York presents Madame Lacrimosa's Shop. The The The Hello, hello, girl. Hello, Ms. Bisbee. Glad to see you again. Can't keep a bad penny away, you know? Well, what have we this morning? Oh, there's a fine Chinese piece. Are you looking for something special this morning, Ms. Bisbee? Well, I'll browse around. That Chinese vase is nice, isn't it? Very charming, but I have no use for it. Are these French chairs? Have you seen them? No, they are nice, but I wouldn't want them. Mr. Bisbee, how about the old clock that came in the other day? Clock? Clock? Oh, that one. Very interesting. But no, I can't use it. Oh, I have something nice for you. A very charming lady sold them to me only this morning. And what is it? Wait till you see them. What are they? Speak up, speak up. A wonderful pair of candelabras, hand-wrought by the craftsmen of old Russia. Hey, let's see them, woman. Let's see them. Don't be so impatient, Mr. Bisbee. I'll have them out in a moment. Undo the wrappings. Come now, woman. Stop fumbling. Stop rushing me. I'll have them out in no time. Well, how do you like them? Well, exquisite. What workmanship. And they're extremely old, Mr. Bisbee. Hmm, let me see. There have been so many fakes on the market lately, madam, that I must be cautious. But these are originals. I give you my word for that. I'm not the greatest antique dealer in London for nothing, you know. There is usually a secret compartment in the base. Now, let me see if I can find the opening. Do you distrust me? No, no, but I wanted to see if there... You'll buy them as they are. I do not know if there is anything in the secret compartment. If there is, so much better for the buyer. Well, I don't know. I think it's decidedly unfair. Do you doubt my word? Well, no, but let me examine them once again. You've already looked at them. And if there is any thought of dishonesty... They are an authentic pair, madam, an authentic pair. Well, I can trace them back to Peter the Great, back to... How much, Mr. Bisbee? And I cannot see the secret opening first. How much? Madame Lacrimose. Yes? A lady came in this morning and sold you a pair of candelabras. I want to buy them. The Russian candelabras, you mean? Yes. Can I see them? Oh, there they are. Young woman, they have already been sold. To whom? To me. No, no, Mr. Bisbee. We are only agreeing on the price. Madame Lacrimose. I am Princess Tanya, daughter of the Grand Duke Nikolai Alexei Petrovich Shibanovich Petrovsky. I want to buy the candelabras. What is your price? See here, madam. I have already purchased them. Oh, Madame Lacrimose. Don't fret, little one. They are still for sale. Outrageous. I thought you had already sold them to me. May I look at them? Yes, certainly. I wanted to see if they really are the original. You may look, madam, but you may not touch them. I was only examining them. Yes, yes, I know, but you cannot look within the secret compartment. What secret compartment? No need to pretend. You must buy the candelabras without seeing what is in the compartment. Oh, but I wanted to see. That is right, my dear. You must buy the candelabras as they are. That is unfair. I offer you a hundred pounds, madam. I offer you a hundred and fifty. Two hundred. Madame Lacrimose, I believe. Oh, there they are. My darlings, I have found you, my lovely candelabras. Take your hands off my property, sir. Off your property? The candelabras yours? Count Norkovsky, you here? Princess Tanya. Soul of old Russia. I keep your hands. I know what you're here for, but you can't have them. They're mine, all mine. The Tsar gave them to my father, and they rightfully belong to me. Please, let's not borrow. No need to examine them, Count. You cannot look it in the compartment. Ah, you know the secret hiding place, and I suppose you know the pair of two. Quiet, we'll hear you. Ah, what beautiful things they are. I remember a vincey night in Moscow. The snow and the grand ball of the Duke. It was a wonderful night. The princess is right, Count. You cannot examine the candelabras, and you cannot look for a certain place within the candelabras. Sir, are you insinuating? Mr. Bisbee is right, Count. You must purchase the candelabras as they are. I offer you 200 pounds, madam. 250. 300. Is this the shop of Madame Lacrimose? Yes. I come to look for something. A pair of candelabras, please. These people are now bidding for it. I offer 350. Ah, then I am still in time. Homisarts live of it, you. My old tainty Roche, a commisarts leave of it. Ah, if it isn't my old Russian friend. Friend? To you, you cutthroat. Friends, ha. In the old days, my friends, you'd be black in my boots. I've come to get some property of the state that was taken away by some members of the old order. Take your hands off those candelabras, my good fellow. I only wanted to see them. I said take your hands off. So you know about them too, but you can't see them. No, take your hands off. That's right, sir. Come here, sir. Nikolayvich Ivanovich Livovich, if you please. Commisarts, you too must buy the candelabras without seeing what is in the little hiding place. What hiding place? This is unfair. You don't like that, commisart. But we are bound with the same rules. I beat 400. 450. 500 rubles. We're bidding pounds, commisart, if you please. Well, 500 pounds then. Madam Lacrimose. Yes? Madam Lacrimose. Yes, Lady Plushfather visit you. I came, I came to buy back the candelabras. Young woman, I've already purchased one. Oh. She's printed. Water. Give her air. Fresh air. It's merge in here. There, there. She's coming around. She'll be yours. My candelabras. My candelabras. Oh, Lord Plushbottom will divorce me if I don't get them back. Madam, your candelabras are now being bought by Kant. Now Kant. I am buying them, my dear. They belong to the state. To the 180 million people of Soviet Russia. Ladies, gentlemen. Lady Plushbottom sold them to me only this morning. She too has a right to buy them. Oh, I'm saved. I was so foolish to part with them. Let me see them. Take your hands off them. Stop, Horish. She cannot do this. Take the groceries. She's trying to do it. You are handling the property of the state. But they're mine. They were yours. Now they belong to whoever outbushed the others. That's right. You sold them to me this morning. Whatever was in the candelabras belonged to the buyer. You must buy them without seeing what's inside. Oh, it's unfair. Five hundred and fifty pounds. I must have them. So you think our treasure should fall into your hands? Never. But they're mine. Lord Plushbottom gave them to me. Then you sold them. For what? You didn't have enough money to squander them. Oh, you insulting man. I needed the money to help my poor brother. Lord Plushbottom doesn't like my relations. I don't like your people. You come from a poor family. I see it in your face. Your husband. He comes from Parisite. Do you know what we do? Please. I want my candelabras. Well, then bid for them. So you, a member of the working class, would steal our treasures. Never. They originally belonged to me. I want to give you six hundred pounds. I bid. And will someone please stop this, this person from insulting me? Commissar, what has the lady done to you? He must love her. All Russians beat a woman they love. Oh, let's not cry. You can all bid. It is unfair. Five hundred and fifty pounds. Six hundred. Sixty six. Seven hundred. Seven hundred. Two thousand pounds, I say. Two thousand and one hundred. Two thousand and two hundred. Two thousand and two hundred? That's what I got for them this morning. It's outrageous. It's criminal. She squandered through a bush bottom's money and she complained. Yes. Madame Lacrimose, I want my candelabras for the same price you paid me. Lady Plushbottom, if you dislike the bidding, you may withdraw. Withdraw? I must get them back. If Lord Plushbottom finds out... Yes, yes, we know. He'll divorce you. Ah, and back to work you'll go. You'll never find another good time journey like this Plushbottom. Good time, Charlie, do you mean? Yes, yes, but what's the difference? Lady, are you in the bidding? We can wait no more. Don't rush me. Did you say two thousand two hundred? That's what I said. Proceed. Two thousand three hundred. Two thousand four hundred. Two thousand five hundred. Two thousand six hundred. Four thousand. Four thousand. Four thousand five hundred. Four thousand five hundred. Four thousand five hundred. Four thousand five hundred. Four thousand five hundred. Oh, I am locked. Change of Russia, I can go no further. Ha, ha. The white guards cannot keep up with us. Four thousand and fifty. All the money for my new car will go for the candle abrid. And if you don't get them, my dear? Come now, my good woman. Either you bid or you drop out. Antiques come before Santa Claus. Ah, this is what goes on in capitalist countries. In Russia. Oh, was it 4,050? Well, bid. Don't hurry me. Bid or else. Lady Plushbottom, are you going to bid? Madame Lachromos, I protest against this procedure. Lady Plushbottom, will you bid or step aside? You're holding up the sale. Well then, 4,100. I want to reach the ease in that hiding place. It must be. Otherwise, the commissar wouldn't be here. 4,200. 5,000 pounds, I say. Oh, Mr. Bisbee, you have a kind heart. Couldn't I have the candelabra? Young woman, I'm interested only in antiques at the moment. Commissar, you're such a big, strong man. Couldn't you buy them just for me? What? Me? Sell out the workers and toilets of my country? Never. But I'll be disgraced. Oh, I must get them. Leave, Lady Plushbottom. But I'm desperate. I'll do anything to get them back. Madame, I have a duty to perform. Do not tempt me. Will no one help me? I can go no further. I'm lost. I'm lost. Good. Proceed, commissar. 5,001 pounds. Come now, commissar. Can't you do any better? That's my bid. Do I get the candelabra? Not yet, my good fellow. 5,100 pounds. Ah, Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, I am lost. The treasure of the toilets of the Soviet Republic falls into bourgeois hands. Madame Lacrimose, I'll write you a check. Wrap them up, please, and I'll take them along. But please, do be careful. It is not right. Let us see what is inside of them. You've won the treasures of old Rochelle. Let us see them. Yes, let me see the candelabras once more. This is the first time in my whole career that I've failed. I've lost, too. Lord Flushbottom will surely divorce me now. Congratulations, Mr. Bisbee. You've won. Thank you, ladies. I knew Count Norikowski and commissar Sluvich. The bidding was very spirited. Goodbye. Well, he's gone. Now I can relax. He had me frightened for a moment. Hey, comrade, we did a good job. Yes, a very fine showing my children very fine. The Comedé Francaise lost some great actors. Come, let's have a division of spoils. Well, Bisbee looks for the Zast treasure. Oh, well, he looks for the Soviet treasure. Here's a hundred for you, my daughter, or rather Lady Plushbottom. Only a hundred? I did faint so nicely. A hundred for you, Charles, you Count Norikowski. And a hundred for Princess Tanya, my darling daughter-in-law. Only a hundred for getting all that money out of Bisbee. And a hundred for you, my commissar. Only a hundred for a commissar, would you? Let's have a drink on Bisbee. We'll be sure for the whiskers over his eyes. Five thousand pounds for a cheap imitation. Bisbee thinks he's shrewd, and he fell by a little act about the hidden compartment. Is there anything in the secret hiding place? What hiding place? How do you do? How do you do? How do you do again? Five thousand and one hundred pounds was very cheap, my friends. Well, the candelabras are not only original, but I found these in their secret compartment. Pearl! Oh, no, I'm really going to faint. After me. We're over. Thanks again for the jolly time. Cheerio.

I know what you're here for, but you can't have them. They're mine, all mine. The Tsar gave them to my father, and they rightfully belong to me. Please, please, there's not quarrel. No need to examine them, count. You cannot look within the compartment. Ah, you know of the secret hiding place, and I suppose you know of the perils, too. Just quiet. They'll hear you.

Bisbee is too shrewd. He must have fallen for our little act about the secret compartment. Is there anything in the secret hiding place? What hiding place? How do again? Five thousand and one hundred pounds was very cheap, my friends, for the candelabras are not only original, but I found these in the secret compartment. Pearl! Oh! Now I'm really going to faint.
