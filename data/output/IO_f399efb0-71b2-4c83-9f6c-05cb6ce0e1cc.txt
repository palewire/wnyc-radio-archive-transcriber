Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. The President's Office of the U.S. Department Bank. The President's Office of the U.S. Department Bank. The President's Office of the U.S. Department Bank. The President's Office of the U.S. Department Bank. The National Anthem of Italy and the National Anthem of our own country, very brightly played by the New York City Police Department Band. Now here is Mr. Coleman. Yes. Mayor Impoletari, it is my distinct honor and privilege today to present to you and through you, the people of the city of New York, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of Genoa, Italy. Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Pertuzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa, in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me, since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. Therefore, the Mayor and the citizens of Genoa, on that occasion, made manifest their love for New York, where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has, on many occasions, proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police, before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scurney of Genoa, during his visit here, the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy, but throughout the world, expressed to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the Mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Vittorio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it is with profound commotion that I have listened to your words affectionate and cordial revolting to my modest person and revolting to the noble city that I have here the honor of representing. There are some facts and acts that are made up to the people. And every act that man has a own meaning, but there are some acts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Honorable Impeleteri, is come to Europe and is come to my city, she has not made up to the people only a visit of cordiality, that is a great way to all of us. She has also made up to the city of Christophoro Colombo and this is been sent to the people with recognition from the people of Genoa so connected to the land of America. But she, Honorable Impeleteri, is come to Genoa ambasciatore of democracy. She truly enjoyed that courage that is so cara to human beings but is so cara, to apparently to a people of洗跡 She has been raciste and I have been the electrification of everything being It is a document of democracy that lives in the United States, where every American citizen, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come she has been able to reach the city. So this is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impeliteri, this visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and to his mayor, who has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. It is also the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic life and who has contributed modestly to reconstituirla. It is a salute of this man and of the Italian population to the great people of the United States, to the United States, to which we are profoundly grateful, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to rid ourselves of democratic libertarianism when they have intervened so potent in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men for which we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently because they have defended democracy in Europe and really in the world really in all the world. And, well, onorevole Imperiteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work because the democratic democratic freedom will be really extended to everyone and there will be peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For some time we are not understanding, but we must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just the moment in which we were gravated by the weight of the confliction of the war. We have lost the territory in which our work could be exploited, misery and ruin, but the attack of this force, this democratic democratic freedom was so alive that we have taken care of our work. We have worked, we have worked, we have worked, we have worked, we have worked, we have worked for the work to build moral and material our country. It is with these sentiments, onorevole Imperiteri, that I salute you and the city of New York and I say that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of our democracy in our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa, the tenacious of Colombo in searching for your own land is an example to all of the genoveses. And if you have noticed Dominic, a lot ofığını, a few сорf pensees, I mean Raj, many and vivir de justice, the playing of the Arnicauts on the mountain and the sea court. It is an Amen, theChat, wherever you see it, and work much better. He was able to join on the Amaloo Constable and способ world under the Christian cross? Well, it doesn't matter if he then has found the passage, it doesn't matter if each one of us finds the passage, if there is to persist, and others will find the way, the way to make everyone free, in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the Mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end we shall succeed, we shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. Listen!"
