Commissioner Monaghan, the Young Men's Board of Trade of New York City, Junior Chamber of Commerce, wishes to present this certificate of honor to you for the outstanding work that has been done by the Juvenile Aid Bureau and Police Athletic League, the Police Department of New York City, for the use of our town. I wish to award this to you and wish you continued success. Thank you very much, Mr. Murphy. After about 15 years in the District Attorney's Office and in Public Service in this city, I've come to learn that crime prevention is worth a great deal more than crime detection and punishment. It does my heart good to feel that your fine body is seen fit to award the Juvenile Aid Bureau and the PAL this wonderful certificate, because it means that you also realize the importance of crime prevention in this city. And thanks very much for remembering us. Roger AM-10. Roger AM-10. You want to call 55 to 017? Hello? No. 017. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. Are you okay? Uh-oh. Not yet. Thank you. Roger AM-10.
