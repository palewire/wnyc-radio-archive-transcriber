The folks with plenty of plenty, got to pray all the day. Keep the plenty, don't worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of ride. Never want me long as I'm well. Never want to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell, are you glad I'm the Lord? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my song, and heaven's all day long. Do you complainin'? I've got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord.
