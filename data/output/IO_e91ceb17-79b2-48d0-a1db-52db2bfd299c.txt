We have a lot of trouble with our other beeper. I'll have to give you an extension in our regular phone circuit if you call me. I think the best thing to do on this thing tonight is to let me call you and then we'll do our mutual exchange of tapes. How's that? Well, all right. Can you do it that way? Well, yes. How about going right on the beep phone and talking to our commentator on the air right now? Okay, I have some of the figures here. You're already figures for New York City on senatorial and presidential. Yeah, this is Monroe Benton. That's right. That's correct. All right. Let me flip this over to you. And then when I get finished, I'd like to get yours. Okay, sure. We'll be glad to give you that. Okay, fine. In fact, Howard, while you talk to him, while he interviews you and you talk to him, he may be able to give you some information right on the air. Yeah, okay. And then after you get through with him, I'll pick up the phone again. We had a lot of trouble with our other beeper. I'll have to give you an extension in our regular phone circuit if you call me.

I'm going on the air. I'm going to be PTR-Albany. Take that hand. Will you flip this over to the studio phone? All right. I think about it. All right. All right. I'm going on the air. Go ahead. All right. Hello. Yeah. Hang on a minute. All right. I'm going on the air right directly. I'm going to PTR-Albany right now. And now, without further ado, let's switch to Monroe Bettman in New York City for returns there. The first report tonight. Hello, Monroe Bettman. Hello, Howard. How are you? Fine. How is it going down there? Very busy at the moment. This is what we have in New York. Of course, as you know, down here, same as Albany, our polls closed at 9 o'clock about 42 minutes ago. And we have in the race for president in New York City, with 10 precincts reporting out of a total of 4,394. That's 10 out of 4,394. Eisenhower, 3,700. Stevenson, 2,999. In the race for the Senate, we have the first returns just in. We have five precincts out of the 4,394 reporting, giving Senator Irving Ives, Republican incumbent, 4,732, as against the Democrat Cashmore, 2,861. As I say, that's only five out of 4,394. We have a long way to go down here in New York City. This is just the start for you in that great city down the Hudson, huh, Monroe? You can say that again. Incidentally, I'd like to pay public tribute. And I know all your fellow broadcasters at WPTR would to you, your great program director, who incidentally at one time was connected with this station. That's true. That's true. And incidentally, we might have another bit of information of interest to WPTR listeners. All right. One of our reporters at the Eisenhower headquarters interviewed Congressman Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania about 10, 15 minutes ago. And he told our reporter that, as he said, the indications are pointing toward a landslide, as the words he used, indicating pointing rather to a landslide. And he predicted that the states of Virginia, South Carolina, and Florida would definitely be in the Eisenhower column. And that he thought that Kentucky would be, too, although he wasn't so sure of Kentucky at that particular time. Monroe Benton, I know you're busy down there. Give our regards to Bernard Buck, your program director and a former member of this station. And we hope you'll be with us frequently during the course of the evening. I will certainly would, Howard. Thanks very much. Now, before you go, would you like to hear from Roger Stevens, our news editor, for returns from this area? I will certainly would. We have our recorder going right now. Fine. Well, I will switch you in just a moment. After I get on with other things, I'll switch you to George Miller, our production manager. And he'll contact Rod Stevens, our news editor, for you. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot. We'll be hearing from you again. Right. Hello, Monroe. How'd that sound? Very good. Okay. Very good. Now, I've already contacted Roger. And he's doing a compilation job right now. Okay. He will call you back. Can he do that? Yes, he can. Ask him to call Whitehall 3-3600. Wait a minute. Here's Roger Stevens right now. Okay. Hello, Monroe. Yeah, Roger. Look, I'm trying to get compilations and totals here in the Tri-City Vote. Okay. You take your time. And I'll wait for your call here. I'm on Whitehall 3-3600. Do we have his telephone number there, George? No. Whitehall 3-3600. This is a special. Our other beeper broke down. Okay. Yeah, this is the regular outside call. So you'll get an operator. Whitehall 3-3600, extension 2117. Station 2117? Extension. Extension. 2117. That's right. Okay, Monroe. We'll call you back as soon as I get these things compiled in a couple of minutes. Okay. Good night. All right. All right. Sure. All right. All right. Thank you this evening, before the final returns were in, because I wanted to tell you that the outcome of this election has nothing whatsoever to do with the deep feeling of gratitude that I have for every single American who has felt in his heart that I might be of service to our country in its highest office. I have a very simple point I wanted to make tonight. Of course, this is not one of my speech-making nights. I don't have to put on any makeup or anything else. But I had a very wise old commander one time. He was my teacher and my friend. And he had a great expression that he used a great deal. And it was this. Always take your job seriously. Never yourself. Thank you. All of us have entered a job together, each in his own sphere, each trying to do his own part of it. The personal relationship is important, but it is not the crux of the matter. What I wanted to say was this. The job we have is America, to try to produce a better America for the coming years. You will. You will. You will. And so that job remains. Win, lose, or draw. And regardless of individuals, there is the job. Each can do his part. I think, and this I believe to be also important, I think we've already done a lot, my friends. We have irrevocably removed complacency from government. No matter what happens, nobody can go to Washington now and be indifferent to anything from 5% on up to... On up to red agents that they call red herrings. But now is the time, no matter what befalls, what befalls, now is the time for each of us soberly to say, now what comes after election? And that's what we must do. We cannot afford to lose one single recruit from all of the bands that have been gathered to meet this particular test. We have been engaged so far in the soldier's language merely in gaining a line of departure to get a place from which to start. On November 4th, there's going to be a start. That's today. Next November, next January 20th, there must be a new start. And so I ask each of you who has been so dedicated through these many months, who has worked so hard, often without thanks, often at times I suppose when he or she has felt they were little appreciated, that the job, the real job, is still ahead of us. No matter what our own positions in the United States may be, we can all contribute to that better country. Now, if during the course of the evening I get to come before you again and bring a word of greetings, it may be by that time the result will be clearer and we will know exactly what is to befall. In any event, again I say to each of you, my warmest thanks, I hope that life will be good enough to me, that I can finally see each one of you personally shake you by the hand and I say, and so I can say, I think you're something. Goodbye. And so General Eisenhower greets his followers. He is now being photographed by many of the photographers here. The General is looking radiant, is wearing a tuxedo and waving to his followers as he leaves the room. The crowd, of course, went wild when the General came in. And now, the General Eisenhower has left. We return you to our headquarters in the Municipal Bellwine. The General Assembly<|it|> in the我不知道 scripture said we left. But as he follows the overall headquarters, theение of the Language on the Foundation Show. The General Joiner griets hit the platform if the Hari leaned into the government of their partner.
