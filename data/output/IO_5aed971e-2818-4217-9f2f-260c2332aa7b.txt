Mr. Chairman Governor Dewey Mayor O'Dwyer Mr. Coleman And Distinguished Guests It's a Great Pleasure For Me To Take Part In The Dedication Of This Splendid Airfield Here In The City Chosen By The United Nations To Be Its Permanent Home I Am Happy Also To Be Present For The Review Of The United States Air Force The First Review Since The Air Force Became An Independent Arm Of Our National Military Establishment The Demonstration Of Air Power Held Here Today Consisting Of Plains Of The Air Force And The United States Navy Is Convincing Evidence Of Our Determination To Remain Strong In The Cause Of Peace The New York International Airport Is A Sign Of Confidence Of The American People That We Shall Have Lasting Peace In The Years Ahead This Is A Field Built In The Conviction That Peaceful Air Travel And Air Commerce Will Expand In Volume And In Importance But The Kind Of Peace The Peace Of Free Men Which This Field It Represents Will Not Come Easily We Must Work For It Three Requirements Must Be Met Before We Can Have World Peace With Liberty For All The First Of These Is Confidence Confidence Together With Firmness And Courage Among The Peoples Of The World Who Are Striving Toward Peace A Good Many People In The World Today Seem To Have Lost Their Hope For Peace And Their Courage To Work For It They Seem To Have Forgotten That Courage And The Determination To Stand Up For What Is Right Are Essential If Peace And Liberty Are To Prevail When They Look Around Them They See Only Trouble And Danger It Is Our Job The Job Of The American People To Help Restore Confidence All Over The World That Peace Is Not Only Possible But Inevitable If The Peoples Of The World Work Together It Is Our Job To Restore The Courage Of Those Who Are So Worried About Today That They Have Lost The Heart To Work For Tomorrow The Basis Of Our National Effort To Restore Confidence And Courage Must Be Unwavering Support Of The United Nations We Are Proud Of The Fact That We Played An Active Part In Founding The United Nations We Are Glad That The United Nations Has Chosen New York As Its Permanent Home Now We Must Search Constantly For Ways To Strengthen The United Nations And Build It Into A World Organization Which Can Maintain Permanent Peace With Liberty Under A System Of World Justice 一 Time in the work of the United Nations. It will be the front door of the United Nations. Men and women from the far corners of the earth will land here in their search for peaceful solutions to their country's difficulties. Representatives of the United Nations will take off from here for troubled areas to make peaceful on-the-spot settlements. We welcome the dedication of this field for the contribution it will make to the success of the United Nations. A second requirement for world peace is mutual trust and understanding among the plain people of the world. We in the United States believe that the way to get along with your neighbor is to know him well. We want to know our neighbors all over the world. We want them to know us. We welcome full exchange of information and ideas. We favor the greatest possible freedom in international travel and communication because we know that knowledge leads to understanding. there never has been and never can be war between nations when their peoples have known and understand each other. This airfield will help us to know our neighbors better. Papers printed in the morning in New York will be on the streets of European cities at night. Of course, the best way to get to know our neighbors is to meet them. We all know how the airplane has made it easier for us to travel, how quickly we can go great distances. When I was a boy, it would have taken President Grover Cleveland nearly three weeks to go to Rio and the United States in Brazil. But I was able to fly down to Rio last year in 18 hours of actual travel. I'm only one of many thousands of Americans who have become acquainted with other countries because of the airplane. Here, more and more world travelers come to the United States to find out what we Americans are like. Because the Atlal Wild Airport will encourage foreign travel, it will promote the international understanding which makes for peace. We welcome this field for that important reason, too. The third requirement for peace is world economic recovery. The American people are doing their best to bring about recovery by sharing the products of our factories and fields and by lending the money necessary to revive industry and agriculture in other countries. We welcome Idlebile Airport because it will help so greatly in the free and rapid exchange of goods. This is the essence of international trade and prosperity. Once the devastation of war has been repaired, the countries of the world can produce enough for everybody. With the knowledge we now have about medicine and agriculture and the many other sciences, the danger of war, which comes from mass poverty, should vanish forever. In all three ways, in restoring confidence, in encouraging mutual trust and understanding, and in promoting economic recovery, the American people are meeting their requirements for lasting peace. In all these ways, the New York International Airport is both a symbol of our faith that we shall have peace and a contribution toward achieving peace. The Statue of Liberty, only a few miles from here, has long symbolized the liberty of our democracy to all who come by sea. I hope that this field will symbolize our devotion to peace to all who come by air. We just heard the program of the formal dedication of New York International Airport and opening of the International Air Exposition. President Truman has just spoken, and this was all part of WNYC's vast coverage of this great exposition, which will be continued now for nine days. This is the municipal broadcasting system. Together on any airfield at any time in the history of aviation, New York City has seen the development of aviation in its own three airfields, Floyd Bennett Field, LaGuardia Field, and finally, Idlewild, New York's International Airport. Commander Capehart and the stout pilots who have carried this great show and its description has had the facility of the loudspeaker systems of WNYC at the instance of the mayor so that every person present as the guest of the mayor of the city of New York and Grover A. Whalen, chairman of the Golden Jubilee Committee, would hear in detail the descriptions given by the pilots so that you would understand why these planes are in the air, what they're doing, what services they represented, and the audibility and visibility were tied together through the PA systems of your municipal station. And now the man who knows better how to present New York in the New York manner because of his love for his city and the great potentialities of that city was the great creative genius of this air exposition here at Idlewild Airport. And now it is our privilege to present the busiest, most thorough man in the city of New York, the Honorable Grover A. Whalen. Thank you, Tommy. You know what Tommy said about the great station WNYC is quite true. For years, a lot of folks thought that WNYC's voice should be still. But since I was the father of it, I felt that one of the things that was most important in New York, that there should be a station that didn't have to follow the dictates of any commercial sponsor in order to use the air for the benefit of the people of this great city. You know, few of us have a voice in the affairs of a great country or a great city. But through the municipal radio station WNYC, I have heard youngsters given an opportunity to show their talents and to demonstrate whether they should have an opportunity to go on in the world of opera, song, or drama, as well as the services of the people having an opportunity to tell the people about the health situation, what the fire department, police department, sanitation department, and all the services of our city are rendering in our interest. Because when you think of this city of 8 million people with 2 million daily visitors, you are thinking and living in terms of a great country. We are 33 in population and size of all the countries in the world. 33. And that this great city of ours, which we today celebrate its golden anniversary, that was conceived in 1898, is one of the achievements that we can be well proud of. The consolidation of the five boroughs of the city of New York. And it took the man, Green, who spent 30 years of his life trying to convince the politicians, those of influence in business and in the affairs of the city, that the consolidation was the smartest thing that the city of New York could do. And so after 30 years of labor, this great man, remember the name, Green, brought about the consolidation of the city of New York. He also did something else. He is the man that conceived Central Park. What would we do today without Central Park? In the midst of a very narrow island, there he carved out, 50 years ago, Central Park. Andrew H. Green will live in the memories, I hope, of the people of the city for generations to come. Then it came to an immigrant boy to feel the necessity of calling attention to these facts. Mayor William O'Dwyer. And he asked let a committee be appointed and he asked me to serve as his chairman. The committee was appointed and it was asked to submit a program for the commemoration of the consolidation of the city of New York. That program had five facets. The first was the New York at Work demonstration on June 12th, which showed the strength of New York services in a visual way so that the man who runs may read and understand. A million of our fellow citizens came out and saw that demonstration. The second phase of our commemoration is this unforgettable international air exposition. I wish it were possible for me to marshal all the adjectives that Webster has in his dictionary in order to tell you my feeling today of what this has meant not only to the people of the world but to the people of the United States and the city of New York as well. we were on the lips by we I mean New York City was on the lips of everybody in the United States last Saturday. Every radio was tuned into this platform where the President of the United States Governor Dewey Mayor O'Dwyer and half of the Congress of the United States were present. a little water so that you'll find that these moments of recording the record is important to us all to you and to me and so as I say farewell to this greatest of all demonstration I bow in humble supplication to the Lord that he was able to allow us to have this great demonstration without a serious accident. You know as I know that the dangers that lurked in the sky and that lurked all around us were very great but no serious accident has been recorded no injuries on the highway have reported except except the small one we had the other day here in the helicopter the number of people treated by the hospital department was only from overcome of heat and exhaustion no serious accidents of any kind the studies that were made to make this strip that you are on another pound you are a there are everything a Ha a a a a hurrican hole a shoulder a job and a Moo a
