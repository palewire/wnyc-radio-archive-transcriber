Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is the voice of New York City, WNYC, speaking to you from the Park Terrace Garden Apartments in Astoria, Jackson Heights, Queens, New York. The purpose is the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund Party, given by the Park Terrace Garden Apartments Development. It's a wonderful thing with hundreds of children gathered here this afternoon. The sun is bright, the air is crisp and cold. The wedding for Santa Claus to make its appearance is going to come down a long, long street with a tremendous white beard, red suit, and drive up to the children's stands. And there, the children will see him, greet him, and the party will then get underway. Huh? Hello, everybody. I want to welcome you to the Terrace Park Christmas Party. Can everybody hear me now? Yes. Can everybody hear me now? I want to welcome you all to the Terrace Park Christmas Party. Santa Claus will soon be here with gifts and refreshments for every little boy and girl. And while he's on his way here, I want to tell you a little about this party. As you all know, Terrace Park is a new community of some 258 families. When our tenants' group got the idea for this party, a first party for a first community, we said, let's have an unusual Christmas party. And so we sent a letter to Santa Claus, and we said, Santa Claus, we think it would be a very nice idea at the end of this year to have a Christmas party. But not an ordinary Christmas party, not something in which everybody would just get gifts, but in which we could do something nice for other people at the same time. And we said, you know what, Santa Claus? We've heard of an organization that gives food and medicine and clothing to little boys and girls overseas. And what we think we will do is we will ask everybody in Terrace Park to come to this party. And we will give them gifts from Santa Claus, and we will ask them in turn to give gifts to this organization. And Santa Claus said, he said to me, that's a wonderful idea. That's one of the best ideas for a Christmas party I've ever heard. In fact, I'm going to come down myself. So we said, fine, Santa Claus. We told him how to get to Terrace Park. Now this party is being run. Now if you look down there, you'll see Santa Claus coming now. All right, everybody sit down. He has to go around the development first. This party is being given. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? This party is being given for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. Children, I know that you're going to have to go around the world. You hear that tremendous roar that just went up. Hundreds of children gathered in the street have just seen the procession carrying Santa Claus. And we're waiting for him. We haven't seen him yet. Oh, yes, yes, we do. We see him. We hear the noise. And there is a hush of expectation. Here he is. Look at him. He's a little baby Austin. And he's just waving to the kids. The kids have gone wild again. Do you hear the noise now? Children, will you please wait outside? He'll be here in a few minutes. Now, I know every little boy and girl is very anxious to see Santa Claus and to speak to him. And if you'll just be patient for a few minutes, I'm sure he's going to be here. And he'll probably come here with Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Keep him all around. Now, don't forget. Have your tickets to give to Santa Claus and you will get your gift. And daddies and mommies, we ask that when your child comes to Santa Claus, you remember to give your gift to the UN Children's Fund. Oh. Well, here comes Santa Claus now. Oh, Santa Claus. And here he is. And a wonderful sight. The sun is shining brightly and Santa's driving up to the enclosed quadrangle. Mothers are holding little children in their arms because it's the first time they've ever seen Santa Claus in their lives. Baby characters being wheeled at the curb too. The father's standing about looking very proudly as the young two look at Santa, hear him, and look forward to greeting Santa themselves. All right, Santa Claus, come on over here. Now you hear the applause and the hand clapping of photographers who take pictures of Santa Claus because should any of the children ever think they hadn't seen him, then there would be photographic proof that they had. And they do see him. Say a few words. All right, Santa Claus, we'll be here in just a few moments, people. Come on, Santa Claus, everybody wants to hear you say hello. All right, Santa Claus. Well, well, Santa Claus, welcome to Terence Park. We're glad you could make it. How do you do, little Dave? And all you fine children, nice to see you all. Santa Claus, where's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer? Well, Dave, little trouble. Coming down from the North Pole, you ran out of snow. So Rudolph doesn't like this hard ground. So I said to Rudolph, you stay here, Rudolph, and I'll pick me up my little car. So I picked up my little car, and here I am, right at times. Now, children, can I make this? You want to help me up? All right, children, if you will all go outside of the benches now, to the entrance, Santa Claus's helpers will let you in one at a time, and then you can come up to Santa Claus and say a few words to him, and he will give you a present. As soon as you're all outside of the gates, then we will begin. Now, don't forget, give your tickets to Santa Claus's helper, Daddy's and Mommy's gift to Santa Claus's helper. All right, children, come on in now and see Santa Claus. Oh! What's your name, little girl? Michael. Michael, you're a boy. You fooled me. You sit up here. How old are you, Mike? Four years.

Boys and girls, Santa Claus's brownies now are serving refreshments. Cookies and milk. As you get your gift, you will find the cookies and milk being served by Santa Claus's brownies now. Right over here. That's a train. I don't know if I'm on orders. I'll see what I can do. Okay. That's right. Can you meet? That's right. We interview you. We take you to our Mrs. Santa Claus. Can you tell us how this whole project originated? Who started it? How you got such a wonderful group of people together? Well, the Terrace Park Tenants Group is an organization which belongs to the tenants of this particular development called Terrace Park. We have one representative for each of our 16 units. We have to meet delegates to meet. Originally, they met purely on a grievance space. It's with the landlord and tenant relationship. But afterwards, we decided to make it into a community activity to carry on with the project. And one of our first affairs is this Christmas party for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. And we felt that it was highly fair to have a party for our kids when there were so many children who were deprived throughout the world. And everyone was in full accord with the court for which the party was being given under the house by the tenant. Are there any kind of restrictions whatsoever? Any restrictions for the use to which the funds may be put? The United Nations will allocate the funds to say please do. Then this whole idea is completely non-septarian and universal. Right, yeah, exactly. Is this your son? Yeah, this is my son. Did you say something into the microphone? Go ahead, buddy. We're broadcast. We've got to do NYC. Say something. Tell them about the Christmas party. Why are we always rest with two? You don't have to if you don't want to. Wouldn't you like to tell the children overseas how happy you are to give them a party for them? And how we got all the presents? You're not feeling right. You don't want to say anything. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Come on. Something for my friends. Something for your friends. All right. See what we can do. What's your name, little fellow? Harold. Harold?

Do you people like to say something about the party, why you're here, how you feel, where the children here? Would you like to say something, Jim? Well, I'd just like to say that the spirit is fine. The children are enjoying themselves immensely, and the parents are all happy that they're able to contribute and are a small wave to this marvelous organization that is doing so much for so many children like ours that are not as fortunate elsewhere in the world.

You've been listening this afternoon, not listening, really eavesdropping, on a Christmas party given out here in Astoria, Queens on behalf of the United Nations. Its purpose is to distribute clothing and all necessities for children throughout the world. Children perhaps are less fortunate than those in our own country. Children whose lives must be preserved to form a more wonderful life for those to follow. At the present moment, the party is being closed. Santa Claus is bidding all the children goodbye. And the sun, because it is the afternoon, has just settled behind the building directly in front of me. There are a few clouds in the sky, pink tips, and the moon has just come out. And we think it is getting closed for this broadcast. This is WNYC, WNYC FM, The Voice of New York.
