Enlightenment Thank you. The invocation will now be pronounced by the Right Reverend Monsignor Edward J. Watterson, Secretary of Education, the Archdiocese of New York, and the personal representative for this occasion of His Eminence, Francis Cardinal Spellberg, Archbishop of New York. Thank you. Almighty God, we place ourselves in thy presence here gathered to inaugurate a new, and with thy blessing we confidently trust, an illustrious phase of the history of this college. In thy presence, we recall with gratitude that the City College, in its founding, was motivated by the generous impulse and noble purpose of those who conceived and established it. Individually inadequate to the task, they united their sacrifices to achieve for their sons the advantage of higher learning, which was beyond their economic capacity, which inhibitions of race, creed, color, or national origin might have kept beyond their reach. And thus, they secured for city and nation the rich productivity that sound educative process can confer on high and responsive talent. Bless, then, bless, that they may fulfill the hopes that inspired its inception and progress by availing themselves fully of its rich opportunities, so that having successfully pursued the true and the good, they may emerge from the quest, men and women mellowed by wisdom and firm in those basic and universal convictions, that they may always see the students without which democracy cannot survive nor civilization endure. Bless the faculty of the City College that they may always see the student as the focal point of their academic prestige, their accumulated knowledge, and their educational experience, that they may respect always his individuality and reverence with habitual awe the inviolable dignity and limitless value with which thou, Almighty God, with which thou, Almighty God, hast distinguished each human being, emerged from the ineffable artistry of thy creative hand. Bless the faculty that their minds may ever be equal to their unique responsibilities by their sure grasp of truth, which alone is the proper object of the intellect and sole norm of beneficent volition. Only truth is reality, and thou, O God, art its source and guarantor, to which the Old Testament gives testimony in ageless words, the heavens show forth the glory of God, and the firmament declareth the work of his hands. Bless Almighty God, the new president of the City College, in whose selection from outside our midst has been operative, the aspiration implicit in the purpose of the founders, that the sound direction of the education of their sons be assured by wide experience, proven capacity of understanding, and unassailable integrity. May his sound leadership commend itself to faculty and students so that the great potentialities of this college may be fully activated to the end that its total salutary influence, under the direction of its president, may operate to the advancement, intellectual, spiritual, and physical, of each student, and that the city and nation may be culturally enriched, morally strengthened, and materially benefited in the contribution made to them by those who will have been students of the City College during this new presidency. May this esteemed president be guided always for his personal peace and his public trust by that declaration of divine wisdom recorded in the New Testament. You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. Thank you. Thank you. I call upon you to rise at the first note of the National Anthem. Thank you.
