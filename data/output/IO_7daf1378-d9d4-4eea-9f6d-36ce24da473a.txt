God has his proper place, the highest place, in our work, and we may be sure that God will bless his work and those who are responsible for it and those on whose behalf the work is done. Unless the Lord builds a house, they labor and they have built it. Unless the Lord keeps it, he watches invade that people. The great American whose name this bill bears symbolizes for us all the ideals of our free, self-governing America. May the boys of Lincoln Hall find in the example of Abraham Lincoln an inspiration to a life of service, service to God, service to country, service to their fellow men. May our Heavenly Father guide and bless all those who participate in this glorious work and inspire them ever to realize that each child, each boy, has an immortal soul and an eternal destiny. Thanks. And the Lord, we're going to live up this world. Amen. So, come to me, we'll take on living here in Mars. Thank you. We'll 94% away. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
