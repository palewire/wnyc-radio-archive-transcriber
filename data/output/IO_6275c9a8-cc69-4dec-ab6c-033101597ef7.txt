Your Excellencies, and ladies and gentlemen and children of a sorrowing nation. Here before us lies the body of a man of whom we know nothing except that he was the son and brother to us all. We know nothing except that ten million others were his companions in arms. He was the flower of our youth. We know nothing except that on the threshold of life he was caught up in a catastrophe, a world catastrophe. His potentialities as an individual ended. His place as a man left vacant. And that his loss is a fact of great consequence not only to his family but to the nation. We know only that this land that bred him is home to him, even in death. Yet knowing so little, we may feel that we know a great deal. For we know that this man, cut off before he could make his mark in the world, was competent to make a magnificent bequest. He has left this home to which it was his dearest wish to return. To us, his heirs. Still unscarred. Still secure. Still free. This land. This country. This nation. So rich in its abundance. So diversified in its human and natural resources. So limitless in its possibilities for human achievement. Is what he gave his life to save. Out of our ports. Went hundreds of thousands of young men and young women too. To fight. If need be, to die. For the promise. Of American life. Now they have returned. The lucky. The maimed. And at the last. These men. Whose silence. Is a trumpet tone. To remind us. Of the promise. Who shall say. That the promise of American life. Was not the greatest single fact. That has shaped the modern world. The world. It drew men. From every corner of the world. Of every alien. Habit of mind. And speech. To unite. In a common enterprise. It drew them. To dare. Every hazard. To build a continent. To fashion. A civilization. It drew them. Not only. With the hope. Of material opportunity. But. With a new vision. Of dignity. Equality. And peace. To create. A new kind of home. For man. The promise. Of American life. To create. A new kind of home. For man. The promise. Of American life. To create. A new kind of home. For man. The promise. Of American life. A more abundant life. A more abundant life. Is the most dynamic fact. That has made America great. It has sustained millions of men. In creating. The greatest nation. On earth. This is the home. They went out. To defend. This is the home. From which they drew. So deep. A source of strength. We dare not diminish. Its promise of freedom. Of dignity. Of hope. It was our pledge. To live. To live. On earth. On earth. On earth. This is the home. From which they drew. So deep. A source of strength. We dare not diminish. Its promise of freedom. Of dignity. Of hope. It was our pledge. To this land. We must hold to it. Cherish it. Pass it on to the next generation. And to those who come. If we are not capable of that. We shall see dry rot. Of apathy. Bitterness. And cynicism set in. I am not capable. الف scantum. I am not capable of that. There is no vibrant no powerful flowers. So its inmessants. Our land. set in. Now, in the aftermath of two wars, not a generation apart, we have come into the confusion and dismay that follows after war. In this confusion, the din of evil voices rises loud and shrill. We have come to know that each war leaves the dangerously inflammable material of another war lying around loose, and that we have need of all our foresight, all our strength, all our courage to justify our inheritance. We must not whittle away at this promise of American life. We must make ourselves more secure against the danger of demoralization of the political, social, and economic gains which made so mighty a contribution to the growth of our democracy. We must make our country stronger. The house we live in is a fine structure, nobly planned and finely built, and made to shelter untold generations yet unborn. We owe it to this man before us to keep it fair and true, with the light of promise, always burning in it. We owe him no less than that. May their souls rest in peace.
