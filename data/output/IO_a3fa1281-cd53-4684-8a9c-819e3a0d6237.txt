With a lady's eye To hold her hand and see her good And that's a very good sign To keep your earthly home See in the close of her mind As I walk along the Wapu long With an independent air You can hear the girls declare He must be a millionaire You can hear them sigh and wish to die You can see them wish the other eye At the man that broke the bank at Monte Carlo And what's along the Wapu long With an independent air You can hear the girls declare That goes a millionaire You can hear the sign The sign that leads to the young By the Wapu long With an independent air You can hear the band You can hear the band You can hear the band You can hear the band You can hear the band You can hear the band It's the ringing of the glory of the day You can hear them bell You can hear the band You can hear the band It's the ringing of the glory of the day Hear them bell, don't you hear them bell, they're ringing out the glory of the day. Don't you hear them bell, don't you hear them bell, they're ringing out the glory of the day. Hear them bell, hear them bell, ringing out the glory of the day. THE END Oh, it's Johnny, I'm letting you do my own. Here's the first night of the night party. Two little girls in blue, lad, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad, who won your father's home. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted above. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I do. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrow, sharing each other's joy. Come, rat, when man was born, they blew their life in time. When danger threatened, my darling old comrade, was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken And a moment has half broken There is just another thing From the old home that we belong There is still a memory living There's a father unforgiving And a picture that is true And a picture that is true Who's alone Who's alone She's my sweetheart I'm alone She's my honey She's my honey My bar co She's my honey She's my honey She's my honey My bar co It's my sweetheart One evening in the month of May I met old Satan on the way I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die If you want to get to heaven in the good old way Roll it up, roll it up, roll it up Roll it up, roll it up Roll it up, roll it up Roll it up Go get the gun Go get the gun Go get the gun, get the gun The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End
