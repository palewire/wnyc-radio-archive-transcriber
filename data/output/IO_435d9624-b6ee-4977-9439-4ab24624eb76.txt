Everybody seems happy and bright like the day itself, and well, it's a great day for the Irish and it's a great day for history, because when the little people emerge, there's nothing to worry about. In a few moments, you'll hear the brilliant voices of the Police Glee Club, raised in song here in the Council Chamber in City Hall, and Mr. Whelan is about ready now to inform the Mayor that he has brought another distinguished guest to this great and wonderful building, City Hall. Mr. Whelan. Will you please be in order? The Police Glee Club will open the proceedings with the national anthem. I'll sing you a song, a soldier's song, with chilly rousing chorus, as round our blazing miles we throng, the starry heavens all of us, impatient for the coming fight, while we await the morning's light, till in the silence of the night, we'll chant the soldier's song. So soldiers are we, whose lives are played to Ireland. Some have come from a land beyond the way, sworn to be free. No more our ancient style And shall shelter the despot or the slave Tonight we man the barn of will In Aaron's courts come, oh, oh, we'll With cannons roar and rifles fill We'll chant a soldier's song Ah Ah Oh say can you sing By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight All the ramparts we watched Was so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air It proved through the night That our flag was still there Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the lands of the free And the home of the brave And now Mr. Whalen will make the introductions The mayor of the city of New York is receiving the foreign minister of the Irish Republic, the Honorable Seen McBride. Mr. Whalen. Mr. Whalen. Mr. Whalen. Mr. Whalen. Our distinguished visitor Ladies and gentlemen who have come here To take part in this official welcome To the Minister for Foreign Affairs Minister for Foreign Affairs Of the Republic of Erie Grover As I see it I regret To say that There is not a Republic of Ireland Yet As the Republic of Erie As the Republic of Erie Ireland was built by God As one full completed plot Foreign domination has split a corner away And it still dominates it And until we get them out of there We won't have a Republic of Ireland But we'll get it someday We'll get it someday In this room ladies and gentlemen who are here And those who are listening in I as mayor of the city Have had the honor To welcome many great men And on occasion women too From overseas From other parts of our hemisphere In every occasion There were persons who had distinguished themselves In the fight for the freedom of people On each and every occasion There represented groups within Their homeland That joined with them To the jaws of death To procure and to preserve human liberty In no occasion until today Except once Did I have the privilege Of welcoming the representative of a people Who have kept up Without exception Of one year Over 700 years Of continuous fight For liberty at home And almost as many years In the fight for the liberty of peoples Throughout the world Speaking as an American today I will be forgiven By freedom loving peoples everywhere If I have a great pride In the history of my people In the fight for freedom And that I have that pride That pride An opportunity to express that pride Here today In bidding welcome to a youngster Who already Has served not only liberty in his homeland But liberty in foreign lands Who has come from a blood stream On his mother's side And on his father's side Where there was no limit to the distance They went in procuring liberty at home And elsewhere I have the privilege today And I feel it keenly I wish I could rise To the dignity That this occasion requires from me To give to Sean McBride now For him and for his people Today and over the 700 years A welcome that their sacrifices for liberty Demand and require I wish I could say to you Sean How happy I am As mayor of this city To welcome you And to give you on behalf of myself And this city The heartiest welcome that we can give The highest hopes for your great aspirations The prayers and the wishes That what your people have fought for That they will one day gain in whole That there will be no partition Of that native land That so many of us look back to With such sentimental interest and glory Sean and I hope you do enjoy Your visit to the United States of America Mr. Mayor, Mr. Whale I cannot express or find adequate words To express the gratitude that I feel For the welcome you have given me today here I will take this welcome as being a welcome Intended to be conveyed to the Irish people It has been my privilege to be here In the United States When the Republic of Ireland Act came into operation I felt that there were so many bonds Of blood and of friendship Between the people of Ireland And the people of the United States That it was only right I should be here on this occasion To tell the people of the United States Of the position of our country Quite apart from the great many ties Of blood and friendship That exist between our two nations Probably greater ties Probably greater ties than exist Probably greater ties than exist Between any other two nations in the world We have a common tradition That is the people of the United States And the people of Ireland Have a common tradition Of fighting for liberty and for justice We first established the Republic in Ireland As far back as 1798 That Republic was established then By Presbyterians from Belfast In our generation It was again proclaimed in arms in 1916 So that the coming into operation The Republic of Ireland Act Was not in effect For the first time establishing The Republic in Ireland That had been done before It was merely securing international recognition For the Republic Mr. Mayor has referred very kindly To the fact that we have not yet reached Our ultimate goal Our claim is a very simple one We assert that the form of government in Ireland Is a matter for the Irish people Without any outside interference We claim as much right to select our government And conduct our affairs as any other free nation That is a fundamental democratic right Is the fundamental democratic right Upon which most other democratic rights rest The right to national self-determination No country in the world Has more clearly defined boundaries A more distinct national history Or a more homogeneous population than other And we claim that Britain's interference in our affairs Britain's occupation of a portion of our country Is a denial of ordinary democratic rights I hope and I trust that that cannot long survive in the theorem That in the democratic world That on this side of the Iron Curtain At least it should be recognized by all freedom-loving nations That the Irish nation and the Irish people Are as entitled to the exercise of democratic rights As any other nation Again I want to thank you Mr. Mayor, Mr. Will And you ladies and gentlemen who did me the honour of coming here For the welcome you have given to me I take that welcome on behalf of the Irish people and the Irish government I would like to convey on behalf of the Irish people and the Irish government Our very best wishes to you Mr. Mayor And to the citizens of New York We hope that any of our people who have taken part in the building of this big city In the building of this great American republic Have been good citizens We take pride in their achievement here There's a common We have a common heritage between us And we hope that we will both remain faithful And that the parts of our two great nations Will come ever closer together Thank you very much Mr. Mayor You have
