it Thank you. The invocation will now be pronounced by the Right Reverend Monsignor Edward J. Watterson, Secretary of Education, the Archdiocese of New York, and the personal representative for this occasion of His Eminence, Francis Cardinal Spellberg, Archbishop of New York. Thank you. Almighty God, we place ourselves in thy presence here gathered to inaugurate a new, and with thy blessing we confidently trust, an illustrious phase of the history of this college. In thy presence, we recall with gratitude that the City College, in its founding, was motivated by the generous impulse and noble purpose of those who conceived and established it. Individually inadequate to the task, they united their sacrifices to achieve for their sons the advantage of higher learning, which was beyond their economic capacity, which inhibitions of race, creed, color, or national origin might have kept beyond their reach. And thus, they secured for city and nation the rich productivity that sound educative process can confer on high and responsive talent. Bless, then, bless, that they may fulfill the hopes that inspired its inception and progress by availing themselves fully of its rich opportunities, so that having successfully pursued the true and the good, they may emerge from the quest, men and women mellowed by wisdom and firm in those basic and universal convictions, that they may always see the students without which democracy cannot survive nor civilization endure. Bless the faculty of the City College that they may always see the student as the focal point of their academic prestige, their accumulated knowledge, and their educational experience, that they may respect always his individuality and reverence with habitual awe the inviolable dignity and limitless value with which thou, Almighty God, with which thou, Almighty God, hast distinguished each human being, emerged from the ineffable artistry of thy creative hand. Bless the faculty that their minds may ever be equal to their unique responsibilities by their sure grasp of truth, which alone is the proper object of the intellect and sole norm of beneficent volition. Only truth is reality, and thou, O God, art its source and guarantor, to which the Old Testament gives testimony in ageless words, the heavens show forth the glory of God, and the firmament declareth the work of his hands. Bless Almighty God, the new president of the City College, in whose selection from outside our midst has been operative, the aspiration implicit in the purpose of the founders, that the sound direction of the education of their sons be assured by wide experience, proven capacity of understanding, and unassailable integrity. May his sound leadership commend itself to faculty and students so that the great potentialities of this college may be fully activated to the end that its total salutary influence, under the direction of its president, may operate to the advancement, intellectual, spiritual, and physical, of each student, and that the city and nation may be culturally enriched, morally strengthened, and materially benefited in the contribution made to them by those who will have been students of the City College during this new presidency. May this esteemed president be guided always for his personal peace and his public trust by that declaration of divine wisdom recorded in the New Testament. You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. Thank you. Thank you. I call upon you to rise at the first note of the National Anthem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. CHOIR SINGS CHOIR SINGS Now, here to introduce the mayor is the Honorable Charles H. Tuttle, Chairman of the City College Administrative Committee. Mr. President, Mr. Mayor, members of the faculty, and my colleagues on the Board of Higher Education, ladies and gentlemen. Over a hundred years ago, the people of the city of New York... ...who represented in covering together... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... jackson- repayment. Whew-里 것을, institutions. If our citizens are to understand and preserve our free system, they must know the history of mankind's effort to embody these values in the laws, the traditions, the customs, the mores of Western European culture, and more particularly in our own national life. This means, as I understand it, that instruction in the humane disciplines and the social sciences, which treat the Judaic Christian tradition and the evolution of our own social institutions, must be broadened, vitalized, and made a common element in the education of all college students. Some of our people, and I regret to say even some of those who have had the advantages of higher education, express ideas and exhibit behavior which shows that they do not understand and appreciate the human values upon which our social system rests. In my judgment, the present situation demands an intensified emphasis upon American history and the United States government. The study of our fundamental governing documents, which have determined not only the character of our government, but also the informal relationships among our people, needs to be made an essential part of the experience of every American youth. Now this will require something more than an uninspired and mechanical review of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the other basic charters of our life. It will require a study of the evolution of the ideas in these documents and a review of the human thought, effort, and blood that was spent to establish these principles as the controlling forces in the relationships among men and their governments. Such study will provide the basis for an enlightened consideration of our own social problems in terms of the traditional rights and responsibilities which these documents establish. It will also arm youth ideologically against false doctrines. It should make our people realize that a merely negative attack on the evils of communism is not enough. Young people must be prepared affirmatively to understand, prize, and defend the ideas and the ideals which infuse our democratic life. These conceptions can be made vivid and real through the study of the events of American history and the history of other nations which have contributed to the evolution of free institutions. Acquaintance with the events which occurred at Runnymede over 700 years ago will cause students to realize that on that occasion something more took place than a mere agreement between a king and a group of rebellious subjects. That on that spot, men took firm action in throwing off the yoke of tyranny and thus achieved a measure of freedom to determine their own destiny. Through a study of our revolt against England, students will learn something about the efforts of subject peoples today to achieve the dignity of self-determination as members of this free world. By a study of the events which led up to the emancipation of the slaves during the Civil War, students will appreciate the simple truth that all men have a right to freedom and justice without regard to color or previous condition of servitude. Through such study of the historical incidents which have shaped our national life, young people will gain a clearer understanding of contemporary public issues and the firmest possible defeats against ideologies and practices fundamentally opposed to our own. They will realize that the present conflict is not merely a conflict between one type of economic system and another, but rather that it is a choice between one value system in which the individual is free to determine his own destiny and another in which he is the helpless creature of the state. They will learn that our system embraces and that totalitarianism rejects such basic conceptions as respect for the dignity of the individual, the rights of freedom of speech, assembly, and of worship, the idea that everyone should be free in his actions except when he constitutes a menace to other members of society, the view that men are innocent until proved guilty. The outcome of the present worldwide conflict between totalitarian nations and the free world will determine whether or not these views concerning liberty among men and the nature and destiny of human life shall prevail or be driven from the earth. At this time, when these very values are at stake, it is of crucial importance that young people know the significance of the matters at issue. In the long run, this knowledge is our best defense against subversive philosophies and practices. There are also dangers to our free institutions at home. Every loyal American wants to deal promptly, firmly, and effectively with subversives. Some of our fellow citizens, however, in their eagerness to root out totalitarian influences, are embracing practices closely akin to those employed by the totalitarians themselves. The traditional freedoms enjoyed by our countrymen from the beginning of the republic are now sometimes abridged, perhaps unwittingly, by some of our own people. These persons are either not acquainted with the political and social conceptions which have shaped American society, or they fail to see that some of the devices now being implied are essentially totalitarian. One who observes the American scene thoughtfully cannot fail to be disturbed by present encroachments upon the dignity of the individual and the rights of men to speak their minds freely. If we are to preserve our freedom, we must not tolerate unwarranted attacks on the good name and the character of loyal Americans with total disregard of the damage done to their names, their families, their right to earn a living, and their other rights as men in a free society. Loyal Americans must not be publicly condemned and ostracized without the opportunity of defending themselves before a tribunal of justice. The public platform must not be denied to some of our citizens on the simple grounds that their views do not happen to please other members of the community. Any thoughtful observer of the present situation must realize that if these practices are permitted to go unchallenged in the United States, suspicion, fear, intellectual timidity will result among our people, and our very social structure will be undermined. One of our most distinguished jurists, Judd Lerner at hand, has said about these infringements on our freedoms, quote, I believe that that community is already in a process of dissolution where nonconformity with the accepted creed, political as well as religious, is a mark of disaffection, where denunciation, without specification or backing, takes the place of evidence, where orthodoxy chokes freedom of dissent, where faith in the eventual supremacy of reason has become so timid that we dare not enter our convictions in the open lists to win or lose. Such fears as these are a solvent which can eat out the cement that binds the stones together. They may, in the end, subject us to a despotism as evil as any that we dread, and they can be allayed only insofar as we refuse to proceed on suspicion and trust one another until we have tangible ground for misgiving. The judge continues, I do not say that these will suffice. Who knows, but we may be on a slope which leads down to aboriginal savagery. But of this I am sure. If we are to escape, we must not yield a foot upon demanding a fair field and an honest race to all ideas. If present practices which undermine the essential rights in our democratic society are extended, we shall perhaps unconsciously embrace the very totalitarian practices most repugnant to free men, and the whole complexion of American society will change. If this condition is to be avoided, one of the most important responsibilities of our educational institutions in the days ahead must be a greater emphasis upon our historic origins, the development of the controlling values in our culture, and the responsibilities of citizenship in a free society. To accomplish these objectives will require wise and steady leadership in the administrative officers and the faculties of our colleges and universities. This institution is fortunate to have at its head in these critical days Dr. Buell G. Gallagher. It's been my privilege to know Dr. Gallagher for many years as a fellow worker and as a friend. I know that he has a rare combination of intellectual, emotional, and spiritual qualities which qualify him uniquely for the heavy and exacting responsibilities of the office upon which he now enters. With regard to the two matters I have discussed this afternoon, general education and our free institutions, his thoughts and his actions, clearly exhibit his understanding of and his dedication to that broad humane learning and the principles of human freedom which these institutions must cultivate in our people. He has an arresting intellectual versatility, an intense and abiding love of freedom, and an uncompromising moral courage. More than ever before in the life of this nation, these qualities are required in the men and women who occupy high office public as well as private. Buell Gallagher will discharge his responsibilities as president of City College of the City of New York wisely and well. On this felicitous occasion, I congratulate the City College on its selection of Dr. Gallagher for this high office, and to him I extend warm personal greetings and best wishes.

And so I shall now pronounce for you our official words of inauguration. Now, the inaugural inaugural ceremony is taking place. and may God be with you. In just a moment now, Dr. Buell Gordon Gallagher will make his inaugural address upon being made the seventh president of City College. At the present moment, he is receiving the congratulations of the various members of the faculty and the dignitaries assembled here. Now, in just a moment, Dr. Gallagher's inaugural address. In accordance with the hallowed custom, we shall now listen to the inaugural address of the new president of the City College. We welcome this opportunity to learn of his problems and his aspirations. Ladies and gentlemen, the seventh president of the City College of the College of the City of New York. Now, here is Dr. Gallagher. Dr. Tuttle, Dr. Tede, Mr. Mayor, friends old, too many to mention, I see here today, and friends new with whom I look forward to the future, I should like today to speak on the subject of freedom and integrity. It is my belief that the free college is the citadel of a free society. In this present hour of history, the continuing battle for democratic freedoms comes to sharp focus in the struggle to defend academic integrity. Now, there's nothing new in the fact that academic freedom must be defended against all attacks. Through the dark ages, the monasteries, the then equivalent of the university, kept the lamp of learning burning for the day when its light might shine more broadly. In the 18th century, the University of Glasgow gave sanctuary from the tyrannies of vested interests. And in that Scottish sanctuary, James Watt devised the double-action steam engine. James Watt devised the double-action steam engine. And under that same protective aegis, there was brought to publication in the very same year, Adam Smith's inquiry into the wealth of nations. And the economic revolution, on which a free world economy rests today. Oxford is notoriously the home of lost causes. But the unpopular ideas, germinated within academic halls, protected from a hostile society, have a way of seeding themselves in the soil of the common life, and later sprouting in vigor to enrich and to ennoble the life of all. Now, I for one look with dismay and mounting resentment on the growing tendency in our day for persons, organizations, and groups outside the academic halls to intrude themselves and their ideas upon the college and the university. I shall oppose with all my vigor any effort of the Communist Party to tell the president, faculty, and students of the city college what to think and how to act. With equal determination, I reject the suggestion that the Nazi fascist mind has a place among us or that persons committed to racist dogmas should be free to poison the minds of youth. And with equal resolution, I set my face against certain politicians or so-called patriotic organizations or self-styled educational experts who bring their forms of pressure upon educators for reasons best known to themselves. join me and Mepps so-called praise them and support them the people that have been raised upon their time. The people's right to know is the key to all our liberties. And this right to know carries with it the right to inquire and to teach freely, without interference from outside pressures. Now, freedom can be lost by subversion from within, just as readily as by intrusion from without. Therefore, integrity must be coupled with freedom if the battle is to be won. Occasionally, in academic circles, one runs across men who seem not to know the significance of integrity in intellectual endeavor. These are they who bring to the process of intellectual endeavor not an open mind, but a prejudgment. They stand on some theory, conviction, or dogma, which claims absolute validity, and which in its nature is not amenable to revision in the light of the evidence. They wear the scholar's garb and go through the motions of scholarly competence, but they lack that basic desideratum without which there is no integrity in thought or action. They are not ready to revise their convictions in the light of the verified facts. They do not engage in inquiry and teaching for the purpose of testing and hypothesis and revising assumptions in the light of the evidence. Instead, they insist that all inquiry and all instruction are merely instruments to their preconceived ends. Now, consider an example or two. The Marxist interpretation of natural history, natural science, is not guided by the evidence, as the Lysenko controversy sadly demonstrates. The Marxist interpretation of history is not history. Instead, it is an interpretation springing from a fixed theory of human nature and of human behavior, which contorts the facts of history to conform to dogma. And the lengths to which the dogmatic compulsions of the closed mind will drive are shown in the current criminal absurdities of the Kremlin anti-Semitism. And who among us needs argument to convince him that totalitarianism of the right is just as inimical to faithful inquiry for truth as is its twin evil on the left? Now, there are voices today which would include religious dogmatism in the catalog of objectionable traits which threaten academic integrity. I count myself among those voices. But notice my objection is not against religion. It is against religious dogmatism. Fortunately, we are emerging from the centuries-long warfare of science and theology. In our day, those who would try to warp empirical fact by seeing it through the distorting lens of non-empirical dogma have little influence. There are so many Valavas impotently insisting that the world is flat while jet planes girdle the sphere. Now, in our Western world, we have acknowledged that faith and knowledge are of different orders, each requiring its own processes. We do not confusingly identify reason and revelation. We hold that it is impossible to know what can only be believed. And we hold that it is immoral to believe whatever can be known. We therefore do not permit dogma to pervert inquiry by letting dogmatic faith disregard empirically founded knowledge. On the contrary, reason and evidence enrich a free faith. And faith in its turn throws light on the path of experience. Now, our contemporary problem is how to emerge from the uneasy truce which has followed the many centuries of warfare between science and theology into the new day of fructifying cooperation. It may well be that the future of the Western world will be decided by the degree of success with which we bring faith and knowledge into an affirmative relationship, both shorn of dogmatism, uniting scientific discoveries and ethical insights into a purposive pattern. Here at the City College, we hold that men are to be free to choose their own faith, whether Jew or Gentile, Protestant or Catholic, atheist or free thinker. Furthermore, we welcome the diversity which this brings. We ask that no man apologize for being frankly what he is as a believing or disbelieving person. We seek freedom for religion with mutual respect and the right to dissent. We reject any form of religious bigotry, not merely because bigotry makes for poor human relations, but also because bigotry is irreverent, perhaps blasphemous. A truly religious man, like a truly scientific man, approaches all matters of evidence openly and freely, refusing to force the patterns of dogma on himself or his fellows or the facts of life. Herein lies true reverence for nature, for man, and for God who is the ground of truth and the fount of freedom. Freedom, when it is freedom, includes the right to dissent with impunity. If educators then are to be true to their heritage, they must, I believe, with Thomas Jefferson, be opposed to every form of tyranny over the mind of man. They must defend the right of men to think otherwise, to dissent, and to quarrel with one another in the search for better answers to better questions. No participant in the educational process should be permitted to retreat into some coward's castle of dogmatism, claiming immunity. And no matter what immunity is claimed, none from outside the college or university can be permitted to level false accusations of subversion against the process of free inquiry. For the essence of subversion is the destruction of freedom, and therefore dogma from whatever quarter is truly subversive. Only when academic freedom is carefully safeguarded against intrusions from without and against perversions from within, only then is freedom of inquiry safe, and only then is the future secure. Now, the heart of the matter is integrity. Given integrity, freedom has foundations. Without it, all freedoms are endangered. No man should be put in jeopardy for holding an opinion. But when an opinion holds a man, freedom has become impossible for him because there is no integrity in him. Free inquiry into the evidence in the continuing search for truth is beyond the capacities of the closed mind. Thus, the man who lacks basic integrity disqualifies himself as a candidate for the fraternity of the free. He is committed in advance to betray academic freedom to whatever dogma he espouses. He has the same standing in the citadel of democracy as any other traitor. And his treasonable presence within the college does not give him the right to claim the protection of the academic freedom which he has violated and which he with his closed mind seeks to destroy. Now, in the hysteria of the present hour, we must, I believe, avoid two extremes of error. On the one hand are those who say that in order to protect the innocent, we must let the guilty go unidentified. Others claim that they would rather victimize some who are innocent to make sure that all the guilty are caught. Surely both these attitudes are counsels of despair. If we believe that bank robbers are bad men, are we then justified in stationing police at the door of every bank to shoot every person emerging from the bank on the theory that we shall eventually shoot a thief? And is it not equally absurd to argue that because most people who come out of banks are honest customers, we should never arrest anyone coming from a bank for fear of antagonizing or stigmatizing honest customers among whom a thief has mingled? And finally, before we cry, stop, thief, we had better be sure that the man accused is actually running with the loot and not merely trying to catch a bus. applause Now, for my part, I will have none of the drag-nip methods of trial by accusation which are being proposed in some quarters. neither neither neither will I stand aside and refuse to act when the evidence is clear merely because some men allege that action against the guilty is an infringement of academic freedom. Freedom in the academic realm as elsewhere rests on the careful safeguarding of the innocent and the equally careful identification of those not innocent. To act otherwise is to be morally irresponsible. Integrity alone in all the catalog of the virtues has no antonym. It is as nearly an absolute of character as man has discovered. Truth is known in contrast to falsehood. Honor and dishonor stand in opposition, but who will name the opposite of integrity? The psychologist argues that integration and disintegration are polar opposites. But integrity is something more than integration. integrity assumes an inner core of moral purpose which is inviolate. Integrity then is the focal center to which all else refers. The city college was founded 106 years ago as the Free Academy. It was intended to be free in three meanings of the word. No money cost for instruction. No money cost for instruction. No barriers of creed or color for admission. And no dogmatic locks on the door of free inquiry. But there is a price to pay at this college. A price demanded of students and teachers and administrators. The price of our freedom is integrity. and only we can pay it each for himself. This institution is a microcosm of American democracy. All of the problems and all of the hopes of a great nation and a free people converge within its sometimes turbulent and always exhilarating life. Here, if anywhere, we have the chance to put into practice the maxim that education instead of being merely preparation for life is life itself. Here, if anywhere, the qualities of sound scholarship and moral vigor can supply the needs of youth in its search for values and its hunger for ideals worth living for. It is then with quiet confidence that I address myself to the task before me trusting that my colleagues of the student body and faculty and the alumni will prevent that confidence from becoming arrogance. In these opening six months they have already demonstrated a peculiar effectiveness in keeping me humble. I trust they will continue to do so without reticence. I am not foolish enough to presume that I shall make no mistakes. Neither am I vain enough to arrogate to myself the deference sometimes paid to the office of the presidency. With charity, forbearance, and mutual respect we shall have malice for none. We shall apply our energies to the central purposes of education. We shall defend freedom with the shield of integrity.
