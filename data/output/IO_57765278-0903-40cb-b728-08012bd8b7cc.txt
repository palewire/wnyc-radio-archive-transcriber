Once again, your city station brings you another report on civil defense, in which heads of the various departments of civil defense discuss the progress of their respective departments. The report this evening deals with the Air Warden Service. Here with us tonight is the commanding officer of the Division of Civil Defense of the Police Emergency Division, Assistant Chief Inspector John J. Travers, whose responsibility it is to direct the activities of the Air Warden Service, the Auxiliary Police, the Ground Observer's Corps, and the civil defense activities of the regular police department. He will interview the commandant of the Air Warden Service, Inspector Thomas J.P. McVeigh. I now present to you Assistant Chief Inspector Travers. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It is indeed a pleasure to be here this evening to talk to you about civil defense and to bring to you a report of our Air Warden Service. The Air Warden Service is the most extensive unit in our city's civil defense organization. When our recruiting goal is realized, there will be approximately 250,000 wardens enrolled. The Air Warden is the key man in civil defense. He is the link between the public who will require assistance in an emergency and the technical services who will be ready to lend their assistance. Upon his shoulders rests the responsibility of seeing that you get needed assistance in time of emergency. The warden assigned to your neighborhood will soon ring your doorbell. Welcome him and help him to help you. Here with me tonight is the man who is in direct charge of the Air Warden Service, Inspector Thomas J.P. McVeigh, who has been designated Commandant of the Air Warden Service. The inspector is well qualified to direct this important unit. He played an active part in the Air Warden Service during the last war and has been active in the present civil defense program. Inspector, will you tell our listeners what the organizational structure of the Air Warden Service is? Certainly, Chief Travis. The Air Warden Service is composed of seven basic bureaus, namely the Bureau of Personnel, which is charged with the responsibility of recruitment, keeping work charts, personnel records, and establishing office procedure. The Bureau of Building Defense is charged with the responsibility of preparation of plans for building protection and the supervision of the Building Defense Corps. The Bureau of Training and Information is charged with the establishment of training programs, public relations, and the information service on all training material. The Bureau of Transportation and Light Duty Rescue Service is charged with the responsibility of directing activities of the Light Duty Rescue Service and that of the Emergency Taxi Corps. The Bureau of Communications is in charge of the operation and the maintenance of the communication system, the establishment and operation of report centers, and the direction of the messenger service. The Bureau of Supply is charged with the responsibility of procurement, disbursement, and inspection, and proper record keeping of all supplies obtained by the Air Warden Service. The Bureau of Planning and Operation is charged with the preparation of orders and directives and the collation and coordination of filing statistical data. These seven basic bureaus are directed by seven acting captains of the regular police force. Will you tell us something about your staff, Commandant? Well, each of the seven basic bureaus, with the exception of two, they are personnel and supply, as a civilian assigned as a citywide director. We have citywide directors of building defense, training and information, light duty rescue, emergency taxi corps, messenger service, and planning and operations. These civilians are highly qualified and able men, and each director has representatives on police department, borough, division, and recent levels responsible to him for their specific activity. With respect to the Bureau of Training and Information, we are very fortunate in having at our disposal two training committees of outstanding citizens. The first committee, composed of eminent educators in selected fields of physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology, have as their purpose the recommendation as to the selection and the amount of material to be used in training. The second committee, composed of expert training directors associated with many national industrial organizations, has as their purpose the recommendation as to the training techniques to be used in the use of the material recommended by the first committee. will you tell our listeners briefly what the duties and aims are of some of the specific units of the air warden's service that you have previously mentioned? Well, Chief, the light duty rescue squad, for instance, is composed of one or more ten-man teams. Each squad will have a truck with necessary equipment. There will be a squad assigned to each zone in the city, the zone being a geographically designated area encompassing an approximate population of 50,000 persons. Their primary function is to rescue persons trapped in debris and to control and repair damaged utilities. The emergency taxi corps includes practically all the taxis in the city, and their primary function is to provide supplementary transportation, particularly for transportation of civil defense personnel. The building defense corps is composed of building control directors throughout the city. Each building in the city, with the exception of one- and two-story dwellings, has a building control director who is charged with the responsibility of establishing a plan to control movement of people in his building. The messenger service is composed of young men, 16 years and over, who will be called upon to carry the burden of communication should the normal system break down. We said before, Commandant McVeigh, that the warden was the key man in civil defense. Will you give us a brief description of the activities of the warden? Well, Chief Travis, first of all, the administrative and functional unit for the operation of wardens is the police precinct. The police precinct is divided geographically into zones, sectors, and posts. A zone area includes a population of approximately 50,000 people and is commanded by a zone commander. A sector area has a population of approximately 5,000 and is commanded by a sector commander. That gives us a good picture of the local organization of wardens, Commandant McVeigh. Now can you tell our listeners some of the primary duties of the warden? One can appreciate, Chief Travis, that the duties of the warden will be many and varied. However, his primary duties can be grouped into three phases. Number one, duties before in the light. Number two, duties during a yellow and red light. And number three, duties after the all clear. The warden's main duties before in the light are to get to his post as well as he knows the palm of his hand. That is, to get to know his post as well as he knows the palm of his hand. And to be able to make a good map of it. To get to know each person on the post and reflect his knowledge into statistical data to be kept in a notebook. To complete his basic training and institute a program of self-education. His duties during the light will, first of all, be to prevent and control panic. Get people to shelter areas, stop traffic, and get occupants of vehicles to shelter. After an all clear, a warden's principal duty is to survey his post and make an efficient report. After this is accomplished, he concerns himself with first aid, control of fires, and rescue operations until the arrival of technical services. At which time, he gives them information and directs them to places where they are needed. What you have just told us, Covenant McVeigh, makes us realize that a warden is indeed a key man in civil defense. Can you tell us what the status of warden enrollment is at the present time? Unfortunately, the picture is not too bright, Chief Travis. At the present time, the enrollment is approximately 10% of requirements. We have approximately 25,000 wardens enrolled in the air warden service and need 10 times that many. However, there is a bright side to the picture. The percentage of increase in enrollment during the past week is 40%, so that I am confident that the people of this city are becoming more and more aware of the need for 100% cooperation on the part of the public so that we will be prepared should the need ever arise. Thank you very much, Commandant McVeigh, for your very informative remarks. I am sure that our listeners have a much clearer understanding now of the air warden's service. I would like, in closing, to urge all our listeners to enroll for civil defense. In the event of enemy attack, everyone should have some civil defense task. No person can afford to stand by in complete inaction. Each one of us must do his share towards maintaining the defense potential of our nation. We must realize that civil defense is essential to the survival of our city, state, and nation. Thank you. You have been listening to the latest in the important series of Reports on Civil Defense.
