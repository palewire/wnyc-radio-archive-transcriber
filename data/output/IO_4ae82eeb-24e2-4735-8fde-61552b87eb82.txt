This is Fire Prevention Week. Last year, four firemen and 124 civilians, many of them little children, were killed in fires or died from injuries in fires. These fires destroyed property worth more than $19 million. We in the fire department are always ready to protect your life and property, but we need your help to do it effectively. So double-check your home and your place of business and remove every possible fire hazard. Fire prevention is of major importance now when every fire interferes with our national defense. Ours is the greatest city in the world. Let's make it the safest.
