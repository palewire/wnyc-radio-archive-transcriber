You remember I told you veterans to be sure to use the VA's printed return envelope when you pay your regular premium. If you're smart, you'll pay with a check or money order. Sending cash through the mails is risky. Now here's another pointer. Always make your check or money order payable to the Treasurer of the United States. It's quicker and easier that way. Although, of course, if you make it out to the Veterans Administration, you won't lose out. And if you can swing it, here's a way to save money. Pay your premiums three or six or twelve months in advance. When you pay in advance, payments are lower. And you don't have to keep track of your payment each month. Remember, if you're puzzled about your GI insurance, your nearest VA office will be glad to help you. And if you love music, you will love this next number.

He found he'd overpaid his income tax, so he wrote the government all about it. He really had an airtight case. There was only one trouble. He was so eager to explain about the refund that was coming to him that he forgot a couple of other items. Item one, he didn't put down his name. Item two, he forgot to include his address. The government wasn't able to check his claim because they didn't know who he was or where he lived. For all we know, he may be still sitting on his front porch, waiting for the mailman to bring him a check. Far-fetched story?

You know, a while ago I told you about a veteran who failed to identify himself completely when he wrote an important letter. Now, when you write to the Veterans Administration, here's how you can always be sure the VA knows exactly who you are. Always give your full name and your correct address. If you have them, give your claim or insurance numbers. If you want to make doubly sure of getting prompt identification, here's something to include in your letters to the VA. Your service number, your date of birth, and your former branch of service in the Armed Forces. If you are careful to put down all the facts necessary to identify yourselves, every time you have to write to the VA, you'll be making certain that the VA will give you prompt service and a prompt reply. Now, here's a number, quite an arrangement, we think, taken from the Chikowsky Nutcracker Suite, featuring Tippi Morgan on clarinet, Johnny Andrews on tenor sax, and Al Antonucci on French horn. It's called the Arabian Dance. ... ... Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
