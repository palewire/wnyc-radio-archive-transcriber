The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay Halin amid their混癒 beneath and to help and support the woman's pain I hear the vocal calling and goodbye does it擠 away Goodbye, darling Goodbye, darling My darling, I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am near The air at the front to fight the foe Give the soldier boys a marching And I can no longer stay I hear the beautiful calling Goodbye, darling, pray Come on down south, way way down south Where the sun shines every day Soft skies of blue shine down anew And all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay Come on, come on along Come on, join in the song Jump on, follow this It won't be long We're on our way Hip hip hooray We're going down south Hooray Hooray Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder Hooray That is why I long for you Lonely through the night I ponder Wondering, darling Wondering, darling Is your true Distance only lands and shams then Though the ocean waves divide Absence makes the heart grow thunder Absence makes the heart grow thunder Longing to be near your side Be near your side She was happy till she met you And the fault is all your own If she wishes to forget you You will please leave her alone She has come to her old mother Just because there is no other She'll be happy in her own sweet home When the harvest days are over Yes, she is Christ, she is And the sun gets flowers He dies so free He dies

dreams Your fair face feels Your fair face feels You're the flower of my heart Sweet heaven, my heart Sweet heaven Sweet heaven Sweet heaven He's only a man In a fearless day A beautiful sight to hear You may think he's happy And free from care He's not those he seemed to be He's done when you think Of a wasted life For you cannot praise me And her beauty was sold For an old man's gold She's a bird In a gilded day A little brown car A shady green spot So happy home I find My heart's barely gone I love only one She's the girl I have to be mine In a gilded day I know that she's a boy For an old man's gold In a gilded day I know that she's a man And you're the girl I have to be mine I have to be mine You may think he's a man I have to be mine I have to be mine CHOIR SINGS CHOIR SINGS CHOIR
