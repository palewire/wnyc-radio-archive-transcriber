When the fundamental principle of the right of man to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, we have this program appropriately for you here today. We now have the privilege of presenting Gardner Osborne, past president of the New York chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution, who will preside and present the regular order of program. Gardner Osborne. As the Trinity chimes, call the hour. I will now introduce our soloist, William J. Farrell, United States Coast Guard retired, who has sung here many times for us. He will open the program with the national anthem. Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Those broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight. All the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there O'er say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free And the home of the brave We will all stay standing We will have Dr. Sunshine Who in public life, private life, as Henry Du Bois Delivered the famous Washington Prayer As our invocation today Dr. Sunshine It is June 8, 1783 A day long to be remembered In the annals of our national life It now becomes my solemn duty To disband the Continental Army We now return to the building of that republic For which under God We have become responsible Shall we pray? Almighty God, we make our earnest prayer That thou wilt keep the United States In thy holy protection That thou wilt incline the hearts of the citizens To cultivate a spirit of subordination And obedience to government And entertain a brotherly affection and love For one another And for the citizens of these United States at large And finally That thou wilt most graciously be pleased To dispose us all to do justice To love mercy And to demean ourselves with that charity Humility and the pacific temper of mind Which were the characteristics Of the divine author of our blessed religion Without an humble imitation Of whose example in these things We can never hope to be a happy nation Grant our supplications We beseech thee Through Jesus Christ, our Lord Amen George Washington is our country's finest example Of distinguished public service He could never say no When his country called him From the peace of his Mount Vernon home Therefore each year The New York chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution Will pay tribute to that rare trait By the public presentation Of a medal Especially designed to symbolize public service This medal To be presented today to Mr. George McEnany Bears the likeness of Chauncey M. Depew The founder of our society in the state of New York Depew A name to conjure with Depew The modern symbol of public service We have invited The Honorable James Farley To recall for us A bit of the greatness of Chauncey Depew Mr. Farley Among his many other duties Is a member of the board Of the directors Of the New York Central Railroad Which Mr. Chauncey Depew Served for many, many years As president And then as chairman of the board Until his death We are indeed privileged To welcome to this inaugural observance A great American Best known to us all As Jim Farley Mr. Farley Mr. Osborne Mr. McEnany Distinguished guests Ladies and gentlemen On this commemorative occasion When we seek to capture again The spirit of those noble days Of Washington And the other great colonial leaders We are perforce impressed With the great debt We owe to the past We are reminded too Of the continuing lessons Which we may learn By pausing now and then To glance backward While carrying on Our steady march To the fore In every field Of our activity With this thought in mind I would speak today Of an inspiring figure Of the recent past The founder Of the Empire State Society Of the sons Of the American Revolution Chauncey M. Depew The memory of Depew Is still fresh In the minds Of many of us Present here today And the unique message Of his distinguished Life and service Is one it behooves us Frequently To recall in mind It is no severe accusation Of our contemporaries To say That there exists today No counterpart Of Chauncey M. Depew To expect men Of such rare qualities And such a happy combination To appear frequently Among us Would be asking too much Of our already Overtaxed good fortune I suggest however That we can with profit Seek out and cultivate Those attributes Which won for this great man His deserved place In our social Political And commercial history Let us remember That Chauncey M. Depew Was first of all A man of faith By his own Repeated affirmation He was a man Who trusted in God Who knew how to place Trust in others And who knew how to be True the trust That was placed In him Throughout every aspect Of his long And full life He kept faith With the simple Basic creed Which for him Summed up The entire relationship Of God With his fellow men Let us also remember That Chauncey M. Depew Was a man of balance If there is any one Answer to the question Of how a man Could concentrate So much On such varied Activity Into a single Lifetime I submit That the answer Lay in his Remarkable ability To see things In their true Perspective And to weigh them According To the clearly Established Scale of values From a study Of his life It would appear That to him Nothing was Unimportant By the same token He allowed No consideration However pressing To loom beyond Its true proportions He had the Unfailing judgment Of a specialist In a variety Of fields But never did he Make the specialist Common error Of total submersion In one line Of thought To the exclusion Of all others If we may select One mark From the long list Of those Which distinguish This eminent American We may well Ponder his Uncommon gift Of human sympathy For a man Who moved Continually Among what we Might call The elect Of his time He commanded A remarkable Grasp Of the viewpoints In all walks Of life His surpassing Refinement Growing out Of a firm Conviction Of man's Worth and dignity One of a position In the public Esteem Untarnished By any trace Of bitterness Or malice In carrying out His avowed purpose Of making As many friends As possible He displayed A singular Incapacity Of earning The enmity Of anyone He stated His stated view That the essence Of friendship Is Reciprocal attachment And contribution Represents a philosophy Of human relations That the world Would do well To heed Paying tribute To the memory Of Chauncey M. Depew While I consider It a great honor Is not an easy Thing to do From a character So rich From a life So replete With accomplishment Seems almost Impertinent To select points Which at best Must appear Random observations And when one Considers The matchless Eloquence Which crowned His other gifts The futility Of speaking Mere words In his honor Is the more Overwhelming Therefore It is not In any Further honor That we can Confer upon him Here But rather In the enduring Regard With which His memory Is already Invested That we hail Him today As the founder Of the society Here gathered And as an Outstanding member Of the society That is America And this New York Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution Are honoring Themselves When they present This medal Named after Chauncey M. Depew To one of New York's Most distinguished Citizens Who for upwards Of 50 years Or more Of his life In this city Gave freely Of his time And of his Efforts To advance The best Interests Of the people Of the city Of New York And I know No man Of my acquaintance Who has earned And justly so The respect Of his fellow Citizens To any greater Degree Than has the Recipient Of the reward Here today May I congratulate You George And also the society And express the wish That you will Continue to enjoy Many many years Of health and happiness To enable you To continue to do For the city Of New York What you have been Doing for so many Many years I think you all Gathered here today And all listening in On this radio program Can realize how Fortunate we were In having Jim Farley Come down here And pay that Remarkable tribute To the memory Of Chauncey Depew And his congratulations To Mr. George McEnany Now rather reluctantly I give up the microphone To my very dear friend Who is the past president Of the New York chapter Mr. John Wilkie Finger Who will officially present To Mr. George McEnany The famous Chauncey Depew medal For the first time It's my privilege Reluctantly again To introduce John Finger The observed The servants of Washington's Inaugural anniversary Holds special interest For members of the Sons of the American Revolution For it was on April 30th 1889 That the National Society Of the Sons of the American Revolution Was organized here In New York Ten months later On February 11th 1890 The New York State Society Of the SAR Was organized And named The Empire State Society Its first president Was the Honorable Chauncey M. Depew Whom we honor today By the gold medal Bearing his likeness The reverse side Of the medal Carries the 13 stars Around the circumference With the cocked hat Of the revolutionary period At the top center The engraved citation Reads as follows To George McEnany For distinguished public service We have been privileged To hear the Honorable James A. Fawler's Inspired tribute To the tradition Of public service That surrounds the memory Of our founder We have come to look Upon compatriot Depew As a symbol Of public service And to look upon Public service As increasingly significant In this day and age Of professional lobbyists And so We commissioned A distinguished sculptor Mr. George Lober Secretary of the Art Commission Of the City of New York To create this striking Lightness of Chauncey M. Depew Each year Upon the particular Appropriate anniversary The New York chapter Will present This founder's medal To a man Not a member Of the SAR Whose life Has reflected The spirit Of Chauncey Depew Our guest of honor Today And the first recipient Of this new medal Is the Honorable George McEnany Who has served The best interest Of this city Since 1902 When on the first Of January He was

1885 to 1889 And served for five years As executive manager Of the New York Times During a part of that period He was vice president Of the American newspaper Publishers Association It is obvious That I am able To give you But a taste Of the medalist's Extensive and intensive Relations To the varied phases Of public affairs In this The greatest of all cities We of course Respect all of his Many achievements But there is one In which we can Personally share His satisfaction It was George McEnany Who organized the movement For holding The New York World's Fair To commemorate The 150th anniversary Of the founding Of the federal government Here in New York City At Old Federal Hall He served as active President of the corporation Up to the date Of the opening of the fair On April 30th 1939 And as chairman Of the board Active and honorary Thereafter Until it's closed It was on April 30th Just ten years ago That Mr. McEnany Broadcasts from coast To coast The great news That Congress Had designated The sub-treasury building As National Historic Site And renamed it Federal Hall Memorial In the following months There was incorporated A custodial body Named the Federal Hall Memorial Associates Many of its directors And supporting members Are seated on the platform today George McEnany Was elected its chairman And among all of his Distinguished titles I imagine this Is closest to his heart Mr. McEnany If you will join me At the microphone It will be my pleasure To place around your neck This founder's medal In reward for your Distinguished public service To the city of New York And to the nation Congratulations Applause Applause Applause Mr. Osborne Mr. Finger I appreciate profoundly The honor that you gentlemen Do me And wish that I might Thank you adequately I cannot do that But whatever your reasons I rejoice that you have In a sense Made me one of your Adopted sons An adopted son Of the American Revolution And I am of the opinion That this adoption Has something to do With our common interest In this historic place Here came the victors As soon as the revolution Had been fought To found the government So valiantly won To plant their flags Where their glory Could never be dimmed Shined Flags shining As gladly today As they did On that April morning A hundred and sixty years ago When Washington Standing here Took the oath of office As the first president Of the United States Yes to you Whose footsteps Now resound about us Let it be known That you are indeed Treading on holy ground Here the first government Under the constitution Was indeed set up Here in the old city hall Of the city of New York Built in 1696 And converted to its new use By grace of the city council As the first capital Of the country New York was proud Of her selection As the seat of government To the young republic And spared no effort Or expense To make the visiting statesman Comfortable and happy For Washington A house was provided At Franklin Square Where now For sixty-five years past The clamor Of the Brooklyn Bridge Has deafened all other sounds But it was peaceful then It was the first White House Hamilton lived in Wall Street And his law officers Were on the land Across the street Where the House of Morgan Now occupies Jefferson lived farther down On Maiden Lane Each of the other Cabinet ministers Were likewise neighbors Of the tall towers Of today Members of both houses Of Congress Justices of the Supreme Court And other dignitaries Made their homes nearby In the day-lit hours As they mixed familiarly With the people of the city On the streets And shared in their social actions It was indeed A charming little city here In 1789 and 90 And the old Federal Hall Was the center And main spring of it all Here too The first legislation flowed Beneath the arched entrances The men of the first Congress Passed daily Discussing above all else The Bill of Rights And here on September 25th 1789 The great bill was passed And sent on its way Among the states Until all had ratified it And made it the law of the land It is fitting indeed That we celebrate The 30th of April 1789 On this spot Ten years ago It was my privilege As chairman of the board Of the world's fair To read from these steps The proclamation Of Secretary Ickes Of the interior department Of the dedication of the site As the Federal Hall National Historic Monument A short time afterward The memorial associates Were organized To take over most of the building Under lease from the government To found To open the museum Which has since been visited By a million people To found a library Immensely helped By the addition A short time ago Of the unique Washington collection Of the late Congressman Sal Bloom Given by him To the associates For their own We are now preparing For the making over Hopefully Of the great dome room One of the most beautiful In the land All in marble Standing just back Of the Washington statue This is to be decorated With gilded legends On the panels Between the marble columns Stacks of colonial And revolutionary flags Mounted about the room And the great stone On which Washington stood As he took the oath An inset in the center The sons of the American Revolution Have proved The unwritten partners Of the memorial associates In their ever helpful part For years they have celebrated This day with such enthusiasm As you have witnessed They have their headquarters And library Within one of the rooms Of the building And there they are indeed Most welcome And the medal Of which I am The fortunate recipient Is cast in the name Of a great founder Of their patriotic order A great citizen Chauncey M. de Peu To me That enhances The value of the gift This incident itself And recalls The rare old days Of Chauncey de Peu's New York He was one of the great personages Of his time The head of a vast system Of railways A statesman High in the councils Of his party An orator of grace And distinction Sought for every momentous Public occasion And the brilliant star Of each For which he enlisted A man indeed to remember Who always will be remembered And now Gentlemen I hope that we shall meet here On the 30th Of each Recurring April 30th It's an institution In the city today An honoured institution And we'll come back Year after year I trust without limits To celebrate the day To greet you again To invite you to participate In our labours For the restoration Of the old hall And to do all those Other things That are fit And meeting That we should do As citizens Of the United States To those of you Who have honoured me And to the spirit Of taunts and defuse I renew my assurances Of grateful appreciation Mr. Newton Drury From Washington The director Of the National Park Service Has sent a special message Of congratulations To Mr. McEnany Which will be read At this time By Dr. Francis Ronalds Coordinating director Of the National Park Service Dr. Ronalds Mr. Osborne Mr. McEnany His guests Ten years ago On April 30th 1939 Coincident With the national Commemoration Of the 150th anniversary Of George Washington's Inauguration As president Of the United States Former secretary Harold L. Ickes Of the United States Department of the Interior Announced publicly That he had approved The designation Of the site Of Federal Hall And the building Now standing on it As a national Historic site The main spring Of the movement To save for posterity This important site Was Mr. George McEnany Others may have been Willing to sacrifice This landmark In the name of progress But Mr. McEnany Quickly recognized The loss That would result Long personal experience In civic affairs And historical conservation Had brought him To realize The public's Indifference to And in many cases Ignorance of Its rich heritage Of the past Almost as a voice Crying in the wilderness He aroused His many friends To the need Of saving The site Of Federal Hall And organized The Federal Hall Memorial Associates During the first Ten years Of the administration Of the Federal Hall Memorial As a national Historic site It has been the hope Of both the Federal Hall Memorial Associates And the National Park Service That the entire Present building Could one day Be devoted exclusively To national historic Site purposes Now Largely due to the keen Interest of the late Congressman Saul Bloom The space occupied By the downtown Passport office Of the Department Of State Is expected soon To be made thus Available While plans For the adaption Of the building To this larger And more fitting Purpose Have not been Finally approved It is the joint hope Of the National Park Service And of the Federal Hall Memorial Associates That they will be able To carry through A simple And dignified treatment Suggested by the Lincoln Memorial In Washington D.C. This would consist In placing Gilded inscriptions On the panels Between the columns Of a handsome Marble interior As well as Interspersing flags Of the colonial And revolutionary periods Between the columns The great section Of brown stone On which Washington Stood When he took The oath of office Would be set In a new marble floor With an eternal light Or other symbolic device Beside it Ultimately The remainder Of the main floor Would be developed As a document And museum room Illustrative Of the federal period Of our national history While the floors above Could be used For administrative offices And as a library More significant However Than the details Of this program Of development And construction Which are subject To change Is the prospect That with adequate space Made available The Federal Hall Memorial Associates Will be able To go forward In the next ten years With a constructive program Which will make The Federal Hall National Historic Site The vital force In American life That the National Park Service And the Associates Have so long desired Thank you Thank you Dr. Ronalds And now I want to introduce Charles H.
