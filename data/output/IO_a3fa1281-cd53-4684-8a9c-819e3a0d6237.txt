Hear them there, hear them there, ring it up the glory of the day. Hear them there, hear them there, all the boys and all the girls, they love and show. Oh, it's jolly, I've had it through, I know. Hear them there, I know, I know, I know. We married the other, but we have drifted upon. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I see. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born, sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Come, rat, come, rat, come, rat, come, rat, come on. Go, rat, come on. When danger threatened, my darling old comrade, what's there by my side? There's a name that's never spoken, and a moment that I've broken, there is just another missing from the old home that belongs. There is still a memory living, there's a father unforgiving, and a picture that is true, true, long gone. . . . She's my sweetheart, I'm her beau, she's my Annie, I'm her beau. Goodwill Mally, never to pass, the river I live in, is my sweetheart. . . . One evening in the month of May, . . . . I met old Satan on the way, . . . I looked old Satan in the eye, . . .
