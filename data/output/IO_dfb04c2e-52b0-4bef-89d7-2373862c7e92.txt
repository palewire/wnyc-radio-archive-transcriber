The first emblem of the United States government, which was drawn up by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, contained... A picture which showed the Jews crossing the Red Sea. Right. And the U.S. plan for international control of atomic weapons was formulated by... Bernard Baruch. Right. And the young American composer of a symphony entitled Jeremiah is... Leonard Bernstein. Right. These and 97 other questions appeared on the examination paper of the 6th Annual Citywide... ...contest in Hebrew culture and its contributions to American life... ...conducted among students in New York City's high schools and junior high schools. Close to 2,000 boys and girls from 103 schools participated. This afternoon in the large hall of the Board of Education at 110 Livingston Street, Brooklyn... ...the final scene of that contest is about to take place. Dr. William Jansen, Superintendent of Schools... ...Colonel Arthur J. Levitt, Member of the Board of Education... ...and a number of associate superintendents of schools... ...are here to act as hosts to the prize winners, their parents and their friends. Your city station, WNYC, brings you a part of this program... ...including messages from Dr. Jansen, Colonel Levitt... ...Mr. Judah Lapson, Director of the Hebrew Culture Council, which co-sponsored the contest... ...and a brief panel discussion by the prize winners. I now present Superintendent of Schools, William Jansen. Dr. Jansen. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. It is again a privilege for me to be here with you on this happy occasion... ...for our high school and junior high school students... ...who have gained awards in the most recent Hebrew Culture Contest. The prizes they have won have a greater significance for them, their parents and their friends... ...than the mere winning of the award. This annual event reaffirms for Christian and Jew alike... ...the fact that Hebrew thought, culture and history... ...are completely intertwined with... ...and form an important part of the background of modern civilization. The Judeo-Christian concept of the ethical life... ...particularly the obligation to understand and love our neighbors... ...presents an ideal toward which mankind must continue to progress... ...if it is to survive. This contest reminds all who enter it... ...whether they are the lucky ones or not... ...how vital has been and is the Hebrew contribution... ...in ethics, philosophy, government, art, music, drama... ...in fact, in all human endeavor. For this reason, the Hebrew Culture Council sponsoring the contest... ...has wisely ruled that all interested students... ...irrespective of faith... ...or whether they are learning modern Hebrew as a language or not... ...may enter it. It would not surprise me to learn that some of the prize winners... ...as on other occasions of a similar nature... ...are non-Jewish boys and girls. Knowledge as such has no barriers, I am happy to say. Let me cite a simple illustration... ...showing how a Jewish thread runs through American history. Christopher Columbus, as modern research will attest... ...was aided by Moranos... ...converto Jews who at the time were high in the esteem... ...and in the councils of the Spanish court. The distinguished American historian Herbert B. Adams... ...makes the following comment... ...when referring to the legend of Isabella's crown jewels. Not jewels, but Jews were the real financial basis... ...of the first expedition of Columbus. The subsequent settlement of the Dutch and the English... ...along the North Atlantic seaboard... ...made it possible for all newcomers of all faiths... ...arriving in our country... ...to grow and develop in an atmosphere of freedom. At this time it is also pertinent to recall... ...that the first Jewish community in the United States... ...was established in New Amsterdam... ...later renamed New York. Twenty-three men, women and children... ...fugitives from intolerance and persecution in South America... ...arrived at this port in September 1654. They overcame grave difficulties... ...even here... ...to establish themselves as citizens of the first class... ...rendering military service... ...and assuming all other obligations. Apparently their influence grew... ...in the direction of interfaith cooperation... ...for as early as 1711... ...when a public subscription... ...was raised for the steeple of Trinity Church... ...several Jews were among the contributors. Moses, Spinoza, Maimonides to Einstein... ...have emphasized each in his own way... ...the ethical light by which men must live... ...in order to make progress. These sages have in a spirit of true humility... ...passed on to mankind... ...the message of God as they understood it. Today, the State of Israel... ...a young country heroically endeavoring... ...to surmount incalculable obstacles... ...in order to survive... ...is developing in accordance... ...with the composite pattern of their teachings. It is today a vital center... ...not only for liberal and humanitarian endeavor... ...but for music, literature... ...the arts and the sciences. I voice an earnest hope... ...shared by all people of goodwill... ...that under the influence... ...of the State of Israel... ...there may be spread throughout the world... ...a great renaissance of Hebrew culture. Finally, in congratulating the prize winners... ...and their justly proud parents and friends... ...I want to express the hope... ...that we may all see the day... ...when the troubles of Israel will be over... ...and this young country... ...will be established... ...on a firm basis. Thank you very much. A year ago... ...at a ceremony... ...like this... ...Mr. Moss... ...was then president... ...of the Board of Education... ...and as you know... ...he has since been elected... ...to become a judge... ...of the Supreme Court... ...and in his place... ...the Board of Education... ...now has a man... ...who has us all worried... ...because of the terrific amount of time... ...he puts in on Board of Education... ...matters. I don't see where he gets the time. I know, for example, that today... ...Colonel Levitt... ...has been to three functions... ...this being the third... ...related to education... ...and I'm sure his private work... ...must suffer accordingly... ...but we're very happy... ...to have Colonel Levitt with us... ...and it's a great pleasure for me... ...to publicly pay tribute to... ...his service... ...for the school system. We have the pleasure now... ...of hearing... ...a few words from Colonel Levitt. ...and Bill Levitt. Dr. Janssen... ...Dr. Lapsen... ...Ladies and gentlemen... ...I have the privilege... ...first of all... ...to present... ...to you all... ...the warm felicitations... ...of the Honorable... ...and to their parents... ...similarly... ...I am happy... ...to present... ...the very best wishes... ...and to the... ...the most urgent business... ...prevents the attendance... ...of Mr. Clausen... ...here this afternoon... ...and he... ...especially... ...desires me to say... ...that he wishes... ...you all to know... ...that he... ...extends his... ...warm congratulations... ...to the winners... ...and to their parents... ...similarly... ...I am happy... ...to present... ...the very best wishes... ...of my predecessor... ...on the Board of Education... ...Supreme Court Justice... ...Maximilian Moss... ...who too... ...is prevented... ...only by the... ...official responsibilities... ...of his office... ...from being with us... ...this afternoon... ...and who also... ...desires you all... ...to know... ...that he... ...considers... ...this a most auspicious occasion... ...and that he wished... ...he were able to be here... ...for myself... ...let me say... ...that I am... ...particularly... ...pleased... ...by the invitation... ...of Dr. Judah Lapson... ...as the director... ...of... ...the Hebrew Culture Council... ...to participate... ...with you... ...in this... ...prize awarding... ...exercises... ...as a member... ...of the Board of Education... ...I am... ...afforded... ...deep satisfaction... ...by the sight of... ...this fine group... ...of young students... ...who are... ...assembled here... ...this afternoon... ...to receive... ...a richly deserved... ...recognition... ...for high scholarship... ...in a most important field... ...and I am... ...especially proud... ...that their scholarship... ...in the study... ...of Hebrew Culture... ...and its contribution... ...to American life... ...results in these awards... ...now your presence... ...here this afternoon... ...involves... ...much more... ...than merely... ...honoring a group... ...of worthy... ...and proficient students... ...because... ...an essential aspect... ...of the American way of life... ...is being illustrated... ...by what we do here... ...today... ...you... ...and all of us... ...are helping to demonstrate... ...that our American culture... ...is no abstract... ...no isolated concept... ...but that it is rather... ...a living... ...a vital... ...a growing... ...social force... ...a force which is not ashamed... ...to learn from... ...and to... ...feed upon... ...other established cultures... ...thereby... ...enriching itself... ...immeasurably... ...and there can be no doubt... ...that Hebrew Culture... ...has made a major contribution... ...to the... ...quality... ...and to the... ...diversity... ...and to the richness... ...of our modern civilization... ...our city... ...the city of New York... ...has pioneered... ...in a most courageous fashion... ...in assimilating... ...within its own... ...school system... ...an appreciation... ...of Hebrew Culture... ...which represents... ...some 4,000 years... ...of Hebrew civilization... ...and Hebrew language... ...and which now reflects... ...the... ...democratic rebirth... ...and the... ...spiritual... ...as well as the... ...everyday life... ...of the new... ...Israeli nation... ...so... ...you may all appreciate... ...how great... ...is the pleasure... ...which comes to me... ...in conveying my... ...congratulations... ...and my very best wishes... ...to the senior... ...and to the junior... ...high school students... ...who have excelled... ...in this annual contest... ...in Hebrew culture... ...and its contributions... ...to American life... ...and who are being... ...honored here today... ...and more especially... ...to their parents... ...I congratulate the parents... ...for having provided... ...the home environment... ...which inspires... ...such scholarship... ...and such fine... ...idealism... ...thank you... ...thank you very much... ...Carnal Levitt... ...at... ...this time... ...we're going to hear... ...a very pleasant... ...symposium... ...a discussion... ...which will be led... ...by Dr. Lapson... ...but in which... ...the twelve... ...prize winners... ...will... ...participate... ...to a group like this... ...I'm sure... ...that Dr. Lapson... ...hardly needs... ...any introduction... ...but I just... ...do want to say... ...that his enthusiasm... ...in the field... ...of... ...Hebrew culture... ...knows no bounds... ...and he is a real... ...go-getter... ...in that activity... ...Dr. Lapson... ...in that activity... ...Dr. Lapson... ...in which the twelve... ...price winners... ...will...

activity... ...Dr. Lapson... ...Dr. Jansen... ...Dr. Jansen... ...Dr. Jansen... ...Colonel Levitt... ...and honored guests... ...it gives me great pleasure... ...to present to you... ...the 85 winners... ...who excelled in our... ...sixth annual... ...Hebrew Culture Contest... ...the committee in charge... ...this year... ...was very much impressed... ...by the high quality... ...of the answers... ...I believe... ...that this... ...is a direct result... ...of the growing... ...popularity... ...of the study of... ...Hebrew in the high schools... ...it also proves... ...that Hebrew culture... ...has become... ...a part of the... ...American vernacular... ...the success of... ...Hebrew in the city... ...of New York... ...where 39 schools... ...are now teaching... ...the subject... ...has inspired... ...communities... ...from coast to coast... ...to introduce it... ...into their high schools... ...moreover... ...it has resulted... ...in the recognition... ...of Hebrew... ...by more than... ...1,000 colleges... ...and universities... ...throughout the country... ...for college entrance... ...Dr. Janssen... ...honored guests... ...in front of you... ...are the
