On this magnificent June day, a day that should be magnificent in any way, in every way, to honor the 4th Marine Division for being attended a reception by the Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, with every advantage of acclaim and honor and respect that the City of New York can pay to this great division. The Mounted Police are now entering the plaza at City Hall, and they are always, of course, the forerunner of any great pageant here in our city. The sound of those horses' hoofs on the pavement are indeed most nostalgic, and they remind us of the days when the horse was the only means of getting there if we only had the alternative of walking or riding. And yet that magnificent animal, the beautiful animal such as we see here as part of the police mounted the squads are certainly an addition to any pageant here in the city, and they give it a quality that possibly no mechanism could ever create, startling as though mechanisms may be. And now the bands are swinging in from Broadway into the plaza. The Mayor of the City of New York came to the platform quite early before the proceedings, because just preceding the parade, the cars that were handling and transporting the disabled veterans rolled into the plaza a little ahead of the parade so that the veterans might be placed in the reviewing stand here. And the Mayor of the City of New York stood in deep respect as these great heroes were placed in points of vantage here in the plaza in order to view the entire proceedings when the Mayor's Committee pays its respects to the opening convention of the 4th Marine Division here in our city. And now the Marines are passing, the color guard, and here's the famed Marine band coming up that has played at the White House since the year 1810. Maybe you'd like to hear a little of their music as they pass. They're just about at the west end of City Hall now, and here they are. They used the Seaidet maison like this.. And they are endlessly off inicial Esovic's Gaza and really высок кв coloctuals of combat. And they had Scott sedan's... This is what I wanted to see in Trent De Lan rootقost, who now is peeking down against these countries.

Yes, you should only see Council bococciallns in the U-G riding field attacks. That's a nice sense ofican football on successarks! The United States Marine Band gets a great hand from the crowd assembled here at City Hall Plaza. And now veterans in civilian attire are moving in in various squads into City Hall Plaza. It was interesting to see the ladies of the Red Cross who were driving those vehicles that brought the disabled veterans to City Hall. The parade itself started from the battery at 12.05 and will have in its entirety the complete military representation of the New York District. Now the veterans themselves are getting a hand as they pass in review. An immense turnout of representatives of the various military services here in New York are on the reviewing stand with Mayor O'Dwyer. And you certainly should feel proud that New York has in addition the privilege of honoring these splendid men who have done so much to establish the quality of our history and what it stands for, is also honored by one of the most delightful days we've had yet. We can almost agree with the poet now as to what is so rare as a day in June. Days such as today have been very rare indeed. The way June started off we were a bit worried it was going to be like the month of May. The United States Navy now is swinging in from Broadway. The members of the 4th Marine Division Association in civilian clothes under the direction of Colonel J.M. Chambers is now dressing the square here. It's taking a little time. I really believe they're posing for that either television or movie camera down there. I don't know whether it's newsreels or television. It's hard to tell nowadays unless you can read inscriptions and there is none visible. The few hours of beautiful sunlight have turned these trees here in City Hall Park into a most refreshing green. And it's quite surprising in the few hours how the vegetation of the trees is answered to the sunlight. Because they're quite fuzzy and ferny like. And they look perfectly beautiful as we gaze down the mall of City Hall Park into the porch of St. Paul's Chapel, where George Washington and the first Congress of the United States marched from the wall of Nassau Street to pray for the assistance and the guidance of God in all matters concerning to the beginnings of a government, thirteen timid, frightened colonies who had defied a world power at the time in order to establish the great privilege of man's right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Uniform divisions are now coming into the plaza. That's the Navy band coming up there with its own patriotic air anchors away.妳 on her時 are looking over the crazyin fore. Thank you Paul great. Let's look at the Navy! The Navy band again next TMNT is the military persistence of this area of sleepless cities in the workplace. The Navy있 Startingril 스트� проект isßen federally balanced by its other teams of the scientists of the city and scientists of the sampai trade which is the National Survey, and it's the national Council estable地. They are the CC Wear Camiros Es мі 누 마cizo наб There's one thing certain that they're never going to be able to all fit into City Hall Plaza here, and it looks as though the parade will have to deploy into Park Row and dismiss, and only certain groups stay in the plaza, because despite the fact that it is an expansive plaza, it will hardly match up to the capacity for this wonderful turnout for the 4th Division United States Marines. One of the Marines was bringing up his youngster in the right manner, because this little tot looked to be about four or five years old. He was marching along with his daddy, so proud. That's the Navy band here out there, lining right up behind the United States Marine Band. Now the Marines in full uniform are deploying into the plaza here, and starting to dress the square. Immediately behind the Marine groups are the United States Navy. The Honorable Grove Ray Whalen is present with us today for the first time in a long while as chairman of the Mayor's Reception Committee, and the Ever Alert Police Glee Club and the police band saluted Mr. Whalen just before we went on the air with the traditional happy birthday to you. And of course, it was carried over the loudspeakers of your city station. Everybody in the park heard it, and the mayor was a bit taken by surprise, I believe, too, because Mayor O'Dwyer stood up with a very, very big laugh and shook hands of Mr. Whalen, and then all the military groups congratulated him. So the little thoughtful act on the part of the police, Glee Club and band certainly brought the attention to Mr. Whalen and the happy occasion of the anniversary of his birth. Now in a few moments we'll hear Mr. Whalen's voice, because the square here in front of City Hall is pretty well dressed now. It's a beautiful sight. The United States Marine Band is directly in front of the speaker stand in their brilliant red coats, their silk cords, white trousers, white hats, and sparkling uniforms, and the gold braid and the brass of their instruments. Now in just a moment we'll hear the voice of Mr. Whalen. He's just gazing down now to see that the plaza is fully dressed, and that all divisions are in that are expected to remain in the plaza for the rest of the broadcast. There's a few divisions coming in from Broadway yet, and it's taking just a moment, so they'll be allowed the courtesy to get into position before the ceremony begins. What a magnificent sight to present on this beautiful June day with its color and beauty. But nothing that we could do would pay sufficient tribute to the marvelous record of service of the 4th Division of the United States Marines. You know their history. I wouldn't even take the trouble to repeat it, because it's engraved in the hearts of every American. But the Pacific has certainly written its history in the blood of the United States Marines, a fact which we must never forget. Mr. Whalen is just waiting a moment now, and I think we'll have his voice in a second. Mr. Whalen is just waiting for us to be a part of the American Army. I might say that the disabled veterans who were brought up to the scene in cars driven by the ladies of the Red Cross have a most advantageous spot here in front of City Hall, and they receive a tremendous ovation from the audience here in City Hall. It breaks our hearts to see these fine young men and the broken conditions of their valiant bodies, disabled in the defense of their country. Those are the things we should think of when we spend so much time thinking of less important things. Now Mr. Whalen is calling for the anthem, and we'll hear that strain in just a few moments. The military organizations are dressing the plaza for the anthem. We're just waiting now for Mr. Whalen to make the request. For those who turned in late, tuned in late rather, the mayor of the city of New York is paying the respects of the city to the 4th Marine Division of the United States Marines here at City Hall today. The Star-Spangled Banner will be paid by the United States Marine Band. The Star-Spangled Banner... The End And now, Mr. Whelan. Ladies and gentlemen, at the request of the fourth Marine Association, a picture will now be taken, and if the veterans will please face the camera to the left so that all of you may be a part of the picture. Somebody's waiting for military command. Mr. Whelan wasn't very military. Everybody's standing now to face those cameras down near Park Row, and what a picture this will make. It should have the cameramen yelling for the Marine Band to face, but they're waiting for a military order. That's one group that don't take their orders from a cameraman. Even though they tell everybody else here in front of City Hall what to do, when to smile, when to shake hands, and all that. What a beautiful pageant this is, as the mayor of the city of New York, and the mayor's committee, honoring the fourth division of the United States Marines, who are in convention in New York City, for the next few days opening today. Now, this giant camera's taking this panoram picture, and everybody's at attention just waiting for that little flash that tells us that the picture is taken. Well, there goes the plate in the camera. And, uh, he just said thank you, so the operation is over. Now back to Mr. Whelan. Mr. Mayor, the Fourth Marine Division Association has honored the city of New York by holding its convention here in our beloved city. And I give you, sir, the delegates to the convention, which has been in meeting, assembled since June 1st, and will remain here until June 3rd. Mayor William O'Dwyer. Mr. Whelan, General Cates, General Pollock, Colonel Fulowich, distinguished members of the Armed Services, guests, guests, men of the Fourth Marine Division, all of you are heartily welcome to our city. We, with good reason, remember you well. We remember the bloody fighting in which you and your comrades, living and dead, fought your way across the Pacific of the Black Smoking Island, of Iwo Jima. And the Black Smoking Island, of Iwo Jima. And the Black Smoking Island, and the Black Smoking Island, of Iwo Jima. Those of us who are not with you, from Pendleton to the Central Pacific, in the key battles against Japan, cannot truly share your pride in the force, since we did not share your battles. We cannot truly share your pride in the force, since we did not share your battles. We cannot know your memories, memories of names like Garapan, Marbury Point, Tinian Town, and Zurabaki. But we can and are proud of you. And proud and grateful that you have chosen our city, the home of hundreds of your members, as the place for this reunion. It is our great hope, that old friendships will be renewed here, that your association will be strengthened in future years, and that each of you will join the people of our city, in a quiet prayer, for the many, many Marines of the 4th Division, who suffered and died, so far away from the homes for which they fought. I cannot say to you too strongly, that every one of the 8 million of this city, welcomes you warmly, and hopes that here you will find the best in all things, that make for hospitality and friendship. We love the name of our Marines. It is a special privilege for me, to be chosen as the spokesman for 8 million people, to welcome you again. Also to welcome, General Cates, the distinguished aggregation of musicians, known all over the world, as the Marine Band of Washington, D.C. Gentlemen, our city belongs to you. Make it your home. God bless you, everyone. General Clifton B. Cates, Comedan of the United States Marine Corps. господeman of the United States Marine Corps. Their creeping secondary disappro submission, was born in the American Corps. Persemin levee, Mayor O'Dwyer, Commissioner Whaling, honored guests, and particularly the members of the 4th Marine Division and their friends, ladies and gentlemen. First, I want to thank the city of New York, all the officials, for this very warm welcome which they have given us here today. I assure you that I can speak not only on behalf of the Marine Corps, but of all the veterans of the 4th Marine Division and tell you that we appreciate the hospitality being shown us. As the Mayor said, you served, you and the 4th Marine, had your baptism of fire at Roy Namor, which was a comparatively light engagement. From there, Saipan, which was a hard nut to crack, and then the Tinian, which will go down in history as the model amphibious landing operation of World War II. From there, that gas replaced Iwo Jima. Gentlemen, a lot of you do not know that five years ago, there was being planned two more operations for the 4th Marine Division. One was, and it's never been published, was to retake the island of Waste. The other one was the 4th Marine Division was to be one of the divisions in the spearhead which landed on the mainland of Japan in the fall of 1945. Gentlemen, you have fought, and I know that if the time ever should come, that you will do so again to protect your free way of life. God grant that that day will never come, but we know that you have the loyalty and that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States. I want to thank all of you for your loyalty to the Marine Corps during the last few months, or two and a half years. In conclusion, I would like to say just a word about tradition in the Marine Corps. We brag about it. We attach a great deal of importance to it because we have found it to be a prime ingredient of a free decor. And a free decor, in turn, we have found to be an indispensable ingredient of success on the field of battle. Feeling thus, we have always taken every possible measure to keep alive the old traditions and to add to our store of them as we go along. This devotion to tradition has unfortunately given rise at times to charges that the Marine Corps lived in the past, that its days of military usefulness are over. I would like to tell you gentlemen, which may hear such charges from time to time, that the same charges were made before the Spanish-American War, before World War I, and after the Second World War. Each time, the Marines went ahead in the ensuing conflict and employed new weapons and new techniques to set new records of accomplishment. We shall do so again if we are called upon it. The Marine Corps may look to the past for its inspiration, but I can assure you it points to the future for its justification. Thank you again, Mayor O'Dwyer and Commissioner Whelan. Thank you. The Marine's Tongue will be rendered by the United States Marine Band. Thank you. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Mr. Mayor, although the Marines has taken over the city of New York, I have just received a message from my right, from the police band, and from my left, the police glee club, that they insist upon giving a final salute to the Marine Band and the great veterans that are here assembled. All right, Captain. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy. Please wake up. Voices sing. Let them ring. On the street, in the home, in the crowd or alone, come on and shout wherever you may be. I am an American. I am from the heart of me. With your poor young and old, let this message don't just give a shout wherever you may be. I am an American. I'm proud of my liberty. In the factory, in the mill, through each valley, from each hill, raise your voice and give America a thrill. On the farm, in the schools, as the one said of rules, come on and shout wherever you may be. I am an American. I am every part of me. From Alaska, snowy peace, to the south and muddy creek, listen in because America now speaks. America now speaks. On the street, in the home, in the crowd or alone, come on and shout wherever you may be. Let your voices keep ringing. I am an American. I am from the heart of me. With your poor young and old, let this message be told. Just give a shout wherever you may be. Oh, no, it's egos. I am an American. I'm proud of my liberty. Oh, say, can't you see how we love liberty? On the farms, in the schools, as the one said of rules, come on and shout wherever you may be. I am an American. I am an American. I am an American. I am an American. I am an American. Thank you, gentlemen. This concludes the ceremonies of the City Hall. I understand that most of you must go immediately to the Hotel New Yorker, and those of you that came in buses, you will find them on your right at Murray Street. Thank you very much. The Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable William O'Guire, has done everything possible to express to the 4th Division of the United States Marines New York's appreciation of their great participation in the battles of World War II and the history that their blood has written into the history of our nation, the United States of America, forever. The Mayor of the City of New York and the various committees bringing together this beautiful reception here today of tribute to the United States Marines. The reception committee, as usual, was in charge of the Honorable Grove Ray Whelan, chairman of the Mayor's reception committee. He had the cooperation of the police department in its glee club and band, and of course all the military bands showed up in the course of the parade. The Honorable Grove Ray Whelan introduced his honor the Mayor, the Honorable William O'Guire, and then General Clifton B. Cates, commandant of the United States Marine Corps, paid the tribute that we all heard in this broadcast to your city station's facilities. And that is all now from City Hall Plaza as this beautiful pageant breaks up in its tribute to the men of the 4th Marine Division of the United States Marines. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
