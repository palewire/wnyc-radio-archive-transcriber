And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Bore, accompanist, in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, got no mule, I've got no misery. The coast is plenty of plenty. Down a lock on the door, bring somebody to go and to rob them up without a naked boy. What for? What for? What for? I've got no car, got no car, got no love, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to speak. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my tongue, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my dog. I've got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, got my gal. I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got the sun, and the moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of plenty Got to pray all the day Keeps the plenty, don't have to worry I keep the devil away Away, away I am the friends of hell Give me time to ride Never want to be long as I'm well Never want to strive to be gone, to be bad What the hell are you glad I'm the Lord? Oh, I got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I got my gals Got my gals For heaven all day long Now you complain it Got my gals Got my gals Got my lord Got my lord You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing I've got plenty of nothing from Gershwin's Forgy and Bet The choristers are under the direction of Florence Martirosian With Isabelle Laboree as piano accompanist For the continent The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The End The End
