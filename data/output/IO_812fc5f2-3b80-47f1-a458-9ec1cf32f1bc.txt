This is Martin Bush of the WNYC newsroom speaking and telling you that fuel storage tanks in the Port Newark area exploded and burned today sending clouds of smoke into the air. The blast was reported to be on Doremus Avenue near Newark Airport. No further details were immediately available from the Associated Press or the United Press. However, WNYC was informed of this explosion by Ronnie Liss, a well-known radio actor, who was on the phone with us at the present time, and by telephone recording, Ronnie, we'd like to know what your impressions of this catastrophe are. Yes, Marty, I'm sitting at my window here, which is on Riverside Drive in Manhattan. I'm overlooking the Jersey area. I should judge that I'm about eight or ten miles away from the blast area, and sitting here in my window, I can see every two minutes or so another large orange blast of fire rising up into the air and a huge black smoke cloud hanging over the whole area. The blasts, I should judge, have been coming at very intermittent intervals. This is about the tenth one I just saw on a moment ago. I've seen at least ten or twelve in the past twenty minutes just watching here at the window. We get the echo of the blast every now and then. It's not very loud. It's like a deep rumble. Perhaps you can hear it. As I'm watching it now, I just see a single black smoke cloud about two miles up in the air. A moment ago, while you were talking, a very large blast came. A large, round, egg-shaped ball of fire rose up into the air. It rises up very quickly, and then it diminishes again with a little tail on it. There's another one now, a little one. I just see it over the hill. A little puff of red smoke coming up. A big red puff of flame coming up. It's rising now. It's coming up very round. It's turning. It's about a half a mile or a mile into the air, and now there's a little tail on it. Now there's a big black smoke cloud. The fire is dwindling now. Now it's just a great big puff of black smoke rising about a half mile into the air. It rises up very quickly into the air. I don't know. I imagine it's fuel oil or something. It shoots up with a great speed to whatever height it reaches, about a mile, I guess. And then it just diminishes again into smoke. Well, thank you very much, Ronnie. Ladies and gentlemen, you've been listening to Ronnie Liss, a well-known radio actor who was not on the exact spot of this fuel storage tank explosion in the Port Newark area, but is reporting from his window on Riverside Drive. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, the WNGIR mobile unit has come in just as close to fire as we can. Right now I'm taking cover behind a truck. Around me sparks, cinders are flying. The area around me seems to look like a battlefield. Nothing surrounding us but meadows that have been seared. Nothing but exploded tanks, hose lines, firemen, and burned out rubble. This looks like a battlefield. And it is in the battle of the firemen against the flames that are eating away at the 75 storage tanks on the Passaic River. Fireboats have been brought over to New York to wet down the Atlantic refinery, which is located right next door. I just found the deputy chief, Joseph Higgins, the deputy chief of the Newark Fire Department, who's in charge of directing the campaign against the flames here in Newark, New Jersey. Chief Higgins, have they determined as yet how the explosion started? No, we haven't caught up with that yet. How many tanks have exploded in this fire? Well, in the vicinity of 60 to 65, 500,000 cubic foot propane tanks have already exploded. We're now making a driver's effort to prevent 60 more from going up. And we're also trying to prevent the fire from spreading to the Atlantic refinery company, which is located on the West Bank of the Passaic River. I think you brought fireboats over from New York for this purpose too, haven't you? Yes, we brought two fireboats from New York to supplement two of our own. And we're now laying lines, foam lines, and carbon dioxide lines from the Atlantic refinery plant into the east side of the Warren Petroleum Company, which is now on fire. At the present time, however, the fire is confined to an area of about, I should say, four square acres. And we have every hope now of confining it here without any further spread. Chief, I've noticed that the area surrounding this has been burned pretty badly. I imagine that about an hour ago this would be the most dangerous spot in Newark, wouldn't it? Well, if anybody stood underneath one of these tanks there for it exploded, within say three or four hundred feet of it, I think they'd have been roasted to death. The heat was entirely extreme. It was unbearable at a distance of a hundred yards. And of course it has knocked down telegraph poles and sheds and everything within the area. Our initial lines all had to stay without the area and killed down all fire that was spreading throughout our Port, Newark, and Meadow area, which we have done very nicely. Yes, I think you have, and I think the whole Newark Fire Department has been complimented for their wonderful efforts here. I can assure the people of this vicinity, however, that there is no danger of the city of Newark being destroyed by any means. The fire is entirely confined at the present time to the grounds of the Warren Petroleum Company, with the exception of a few surrounding sheds. Thank you very much, Chief. I understand there's an evacuation going on in the area. In other words, you're bringing out everyone but fire and police personnel. That's correct. All of our reservemen are now reporting on duty. And I understand that some of our neighboring municipalities have sent apparatus in to assist us. We're very thankful to them and we're placing them in our down next or in our heavy industrial area, so that any further outbreak of fire might be successfully combated. Thank you very much, Chief. You're very welcome. Alright boys, that's all I can give you. Alright boys, that's all I can give you. Alright boys, that's all I can give you. Looking for you, that sounds more comfortable, that's it. How are we? Thev√§z is outside and it's time for two to ask you to look down. There's an extra company down here on Dreamus Avenue, way down the other side of the Sun Rail Company here, and do you want them to go back and stand past in the center of the city, or do you want to use them down here? Fire 154. Chief Summers talking. Chief Barnes speaking. I have an extra company here on Dreamus Avenue. If you want them to stay here, if you want them to go back and service to the center of the city. 142. Attention Chief Summers. Chief Barnes has an extra company down there. Lee, I think he said. Do you want them sent back to the center of the city, or keep them down at the scene of the bus? Send that company up to Dreamus Avenue or up to the pumping station. We may need them up there. 143. Did you receive that? Send them up to the pumping station, up at the Remus Avenue. Okay, I'll send them up there. I'm there, too. And then 142. Chief Summers has no time to go in and I see it at the present. Okay. There's too much excitement down there. I haven't got a chance to talk to you. Uh-huh. You're not in the present time. Would you want to talk to Captain Cone anymore? Uh, yes, we'd try to... There's a lot of excitement. There are more... There are more excitement. There are more excitement. There are more...
