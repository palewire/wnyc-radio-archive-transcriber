From the north end of Jeanette Park in downtown Manhattan, your city station brings you the opening ceremonies of World Trade Week. Freer trade, key to peace and prosperity. In tribute to World Trade, His Honor, Mayor Impeletary, has issued a proclamation designating this entire week in celebration of the achievement of friendship, understanding and service, gained through interchange of the commodities by which nations live. In this year of grace, which marks the 300th anniversary of the birth of this great city, World Trade has special significance. The world recognizes the important role which New York City has played, is playing, and will continue to play in the fields of import and export. Under the supervision of Mr. James S. Carson, chairman of the New York World Trade Committee, a gale a week has been organized. Thirty-eight cooperating organizations, including important city officials, have contributed to the ultimate launching of the project, among which are the directors of that edifice just across the way from where these festivities are about to take place, namely the Seaman's Church Institute, who, together with the city, engineered the acquisition of this park, which commands a view of New York's magnificent and busy harbor. It is most fitting that this pageant be enacted upon this site, where it can be seen arriving and leaving the great carriers of cargos, making possible the bloodstream of world trade. Many people are gathered to enjoy the proceedings. In this colorful atmosphere, on this glorious May Day at high noon, we hail Port of Friendship Day. Ladies and gentlemen, here is Miss Anita Eskenderian with our national anthem. Oh, say can you see, by the lovely light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous night, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming, And the rocket we drew, the monster stinging air, Ye flew through the night, that our neck was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, O'er the land of the free, And the home of the brave. Thank you, Miss Eskenderian. Now it is my pleasure to introduce the Reverend Dr. Raymond S. Hall, Director of the Siemens Institute, who will deliver the invocation. Almighty and everlasting God and Father of us all, We ask thy blessing upon New York World Trade Week, And this Port of Friendship Day. Bless the maritime activities of this port, And all those who take part in them. Grant that the nations of the world, May be brought into the ways of justice and truth, That peace may come to all nations. Help us to see the importance of world trade, In providing peace and better understanding, Among all peoples. May each of us, in his way, Do his share, In promoting and lifting up this port of New York, So vital to the welfare of our city and nation. We remember particularly before thee, Those who go down to the sea in ships, And occupy their business in great waters. Be with them at sea, And guide them safely back to port, And remember their loved ones, Whom they leave behind. We thank thee for our free country. Give us a greater sense of our responsibility, To see that other countries, May enjoy the same blessing. These are prayers, We offer in the name of the Master of Men, Thy Son, Jesus Christ, Our Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

It is my honored and pleasant duty to accept in the name of this island of Manhattan and this great city of ours, the felicitations of the rest of the world on this 300th anniversary of the birth of our city. I am happy, therefore, to represent that city as its symbol. But in reality, we all know this is a dual celebration. Since, with the program you are about to witness, we are launching the opening of our annual World Trade Week. I often wonder if all of our citizens fully realize the contribution of this old town of ours to the enhancement of worldwide trade. In case some of you need to have your remembrance refreshed and your memories reborn about our great port, I assure you that you will now enjoy the prospect of renewed vision regarding the greatness of this port in world trade. And my very good friend, Mr. District Attorney, who is known by that cognomen to millions of listeners. I am greatly honored to present to you Mr. J. Justin, Mr. District Attorney. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Civic Pride. That badge we wear heralding to all the world that we are part of the greatness and the wonders of that acreage that is the city of New York.

Seaman's Church Institute has been responsible for and epitomizes New York's global reputation as a part of friendship. Founded in 1834, this institute has grown to be the largest shore home in the world for active merchant seamen of all races and creeds. Conditions for seamen have materially improved during the past century, but the nature of their work still denies them normal social advantages and home life. The institute, through its diverse services, fills this void in their lives. For that reason, your New York World Trade Week Committee and the Department of Commerce are happy to welcome the Seaman's Church Institute of New York as a sponsor of this part of Friendship Day exercises. I want to thank you all for being present. Thank you. Praise Him above the heavenly host. Praise Mother, Son, and Holy Ghost. Ladies and gentlemen, I am now privileged to present the Reverend Dr. Raymond S. Hall of the Seaman's Church Institute, who will impart the benediction. Dr. Hall. Thank you. Will you be seated, please? I'm supposed to occupy a few minutes before the benediction. Father Knickerbocker, honored guests, and you people out there, and particularly you seamen, it's a pleasure to be here today. It was a search for new trade routes to the east that resulted in the discovery of the Western Hemisphere. Those who had sailed for silks and spices were denied the wealth of the Indies, but as one surveys this hemisphere today, he must conclude that the consolation prize was not half bad. The accidental discovery of America is but one example of the results that can flow from trading with our neighbors in other parts of the globe. In trading things, men trade ideas, and in trading ideas, men grow in their understanding of each other. So it is that the story of world trade is a story of the spread of civilization and culture. And so it was trade that sent men down to the sea in ships to perform the hard and lonely task of floating the world's freight from one shore to the other. As men have grown skilled in sailing, so have their nations flourished through the development of trade. As a young country, America rose rapidly to an important role in world trade, mainly because in an age of wooden ships, she was a land of splendid forests. These American forests encouraged the building of our own wooden vessels, which soon came to carry an important share of the world's international trade. This development by America of a large merchant fleet, in turn, fostered the growth of our other native industries by offering them access to the world's markets. Our great American clipper fleet once carried 25 percent of all international trade. We now carry a bare five percent. American ships once carried between 80 and 90 percent of the goods that went in and out of American ports. We now carry less than 25 percent, except in wartime, when we demand, and so far very luckily have always gotten, miracles from our merchant marine. When America thinks of its war heroes, it had better not forget the men who come and go at the Seaman's Church Institute across the street. Many of the men in this audience here today I know have been torpedoed more than once on the merman's grunt. During the last war, we saw many go who never checked in again. And unless we are absolutely convinced that peace is upon us, America had better build itself some first-class ships, or we risk having to send these men out in the rusted and obsolete fleet that won the last war. Peace or war, the American merchant marine must go forward with the rest of the nation. Freer trade among the nations of the world will inevitably result in increased cargo hauling. As countries develop special products, they must rely upon change in order to meet their economic needs. Shipping will have a greater delivery job in the future than it has in the past. And there is no reason why America should not play a strong hand in this maritime activity. But above all, our defense needs should stimulate us to prepare for the job. As he walks down the gangplank, the Seaman is a man away from home. And it is up to the people in the port city that he enters to help him find some other substitute. And that's exactly what the people in this greatest of all ports have done in the case of the building across the street. As private citizens, they have provided a great building and the means for recreating the atmosphere and benefits of home life. The city of New York is celebrating its 300th anniversary. The Seaman's Church Institute is not quite half as old, but it is old enough to remember the part of town when it was far different from what it is today. For the institute goes back to the first half of the last century, when the waterfront was a forest of yards and spars. And when the wagoners ducked their heads to clear the bowsprits of sailing ships nosed in along South Street. In those days, the institute itself was tied along the shore, for it was a small church built on a barge. When we gave up our mobility, we did it for a good reason. The boarding houses that catered to Seaman along South Street, like the waterfront boarding houses in most ports of the last century, were scenes of crimping and shanghaying. Seaman were like pawns and a vicious racket worked by these boarding house masters who, by various means, ranging from whiskey and women to opium and brute force, managed to gain custody of most of the crew of every ship that docked. When a ship wanted to sail, its master had to go to a boarding house to get a crew together, and they had to pay so much a man. In order to be able to collect these fees, the crimper would often shanghai some of his boarders. With a lacing of dope in their soup or whiskey, these seamen could be put aboard like so many sacks of meal. The seaman might not only wake up on his way to the Far East, but he might also find that his first two months' salary had been paid in advance to the crimper who had shanghaied him. These crimpers would not even play fair with the masters. More than one captain paid $100 for a man who never woke up at all. He had simply bought a corpse. These were the practices of the waterfront boarding houses that prompted the Seaman's Church Institute to establish lodging accommodations. The seaman's needs were more than spiritual. A vicious circle had to be broken, and it was broken. But it was not easy as long as a boarding house master had the job marked cornered. At the turn of the century, a brave clergyman, Dr. Archibald Mansfield, who was then director of the Seaman's Church Institute, opened an employment bureau at Number 3 State Street, thus openly challenging the crimpers. It was a tough battle, and it caused bloodshed as crimper gangs tried to prevent Dr. Mansfield's men from shipping. Dr. Mansfield's life was repeatedly threatened, and it may surprise you to learn that the New York crimper's ring was not broken until after the present institute building was opened in 1913. The ground on which we stand today was filled in. To secure our building to a bedrock foundation, great caissons of steel and concrete had to be sunk to a depth of 200 feet. The history of Seaman's Church Institute, like the foundation beneath the building itself, reaches well back into the history of our poor. We stand firmly on our record of service to the city, achieved through serving the men without whom this could not have been a great city, the men of the merchant marine. On this occasion of the 300th anniversary of the city of New York, the Seaman's Church Institute is glad for the opportunity to join the city and the New York World Trade Committee in a prayer that international tensions will cease and that a program of freer trade will indeed prove to be the key to peace and prosperity for this city and for every other port and hamlet the world around. Let us pray. Under God's gracious mercy and protection, we commit our port and nation, our ships and the men who sail them. Amen. The Lord bless us and keep us. The Lord make his face to shine upon us and keep us. The Lord lift up his countenance upon us and give us peace and prosperity as we seek one world where all nations may work together and where all men are free. Amen. The Lord bless us and keep us. The Lord bless us and keep us. The Lord bless us and keep us. For the Savior we get your face to shine upon us. You must Werman Paciode, STYM SAIt Remember that you could have done wonderful things.
