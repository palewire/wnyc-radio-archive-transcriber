The ancient land of Palestine, the cradle of religion as we know it in the modern world, the Old and the New Testament, forms a contact with the equally ancient city of New York, but not quite so ancient in the history of things, when the mayor of Tel Aviv, Mr. Israel Rocha, is received today by the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer. Mr. Whelan is now just discussing a few preliminaries, and in a few moments when our guests are seated, you'll hear the familiar voice of Mr. Groveray Whelan, who generally escorts our guests. And now Mr. Whelan. The police police club will render the star-spying Obama. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming. Both broad stripes and bright stars To the perilous fight Of the ramparts we watched Was so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the ramparts we watched Palestine National Anthem Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave CHOIR SINGS CHOIR SINGS CHOIR SINGS Mr. Mayor, may I ask the President of the Jewish National Fund of America, Judge Morris Rothenberg, to present the Mayor of Tel Aviv. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Impelitari, Mr. Joseph, Mr. Rocca, Mr. Hartsfeld, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. It's a pleasure to respond with a brief word of greeting to our honored guests. The tragic and aged problem of Jewish homelessness and in giving to the Jewish people a rightful place in the world where they may live in peace, in security and in dignity. The Jewish people will never forget the great part played by the United States under the guidance of President Truman and Secretary Marshall in the realization of those ideals through the decision of the United Nations. We shall also ever be mindful of the great helpfulness of Mayor O'Dwyer in the successful outcome of the deliberations in the United Nations. I am sure I am sure I voice not only the sentiments of the organizations I have the honor to represent here today, but also those of countless citizens of our fair city in saying that we rejoice that Mayor Rocca and Mrs. Rocca and Mr. Hartsfeld, the distinguished Palestinian labor leader, have come to our shores for a visit. Mr. Rocca is not only the mayor of Tel Aviv, he is a symbol of that great pioneering spirit in modern Palestine, which made it possible in less than 30 years to create on the site which formerly was nothing but sand dunes, the largest and most prosperous city in Palestine. A city teeming with commerce and industry and growing by leaps and bounds. It was that same spirit which enabled the pioneers in Palestine to transform a land which had lain waste and desolate throughout the ages, which was nothing more than a stony wilderness when the pioneers came into that land, into a country of modern civilization. I feel certain that Mayor Rocca and Mr. Hartsfeld will find that the American people fully understand the great Jewish achievement in Palestine and wish the Jewish state every measure of success. I'm sure, too, that during the early struggles of the American colonists for independence, they understood that a people who survived centuries of cruel persecution, we all understand, who witnessed six million of their own flesh and blood foully done to death in the Nazi gas chambers, and who, despite all their sufferings across the ages, retained their cultural and spiritual integrity. Such a people will not surrender its hard-earned freedom to intimidation or to terror, but will make whatever sacrifices may be necessary firmly to establish themselves on their soil. Mr. Chairman, we wish our honored guests a pleasant and useful visit in our country. I am sure they will find renewed courage and inspiration to go forward with their heavy tasks of state building, from their contacts with the American people and the evidences of sympathy for the Jewish cause among them, as well as from the example of the growth and the progress of this country, nurtured as it was on the principles of liberty and democracy. Thank you. Thank you, Judge Rothenberg. It's a great privilege to present to you at this time his honor, the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer. Thank you.
