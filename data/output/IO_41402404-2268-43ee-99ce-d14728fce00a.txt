Today the Salvation Army commemorates its 31st annual Prison Sunday. In 1,200 penal institutions throughout the United States, the Army of Peace, with its brilliant flags, its uniforms, and its sounding brasses, has brought its message of friendship and goodwill to thousands of men and women, many of whom have half forgotten, if they ever knew, the meaning of goodwill and friendship. Tonight, Station WNYC brings you the Salvation Army's Brooklyn Citadel Band and male chorus in a program of Salvation Army music, under the direction of Captain Edward Lowcock. They will start their broadcast with a Salvation Army march, victors acclaimed by Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell Coles. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ You just heard the Brooklyn Citadel Band of the Salvation Army playing the march victors acclaimed.

The End The End The End The End The End The End The End First of all, I think Prison Sunday brings proof to delinquents of all ages that they are remembered. For many of them, the closing of the prison doors means that the normal outside world grows misty and vanishes. Be blessed by it. For some, it may be the renewal of earlier contacts. For others, their first meeting with our people. To our officers, Prison Sunday brings one of the greatest opportunities for service during the year. Though we cannot free the bodies of the men and women to whom we speak, we can, if they wish it, help free their minds. And thank you once again, Major Berry. And now the Brooklyn Citadel Male Chorus, directed by Mr. Walter, or we'll sing the module of the hymn, Rock of Ages. Rock of Ages Rock of Ages Let me hide myself in thee Let the water and the blood From thy wounded side with blood Be of sin The cup of pure Save from wrath And make me pure While I draw this bleeding breath When my eyes shall close in death When I rise To worlds unknown See thee on Thy judgment throne Rock of Ages Rock of Ages Rock of Ages Cleve for me I will hide Myself in thee That of course was the beautiful Rock of Ages Sung by the Brooklyn Citadel Male Chorus Sung by the Brooklyn Citadel Male Chorus Directed by Mr. Walter Orr Now the Brooklyn Citadel Band Of the Salvation Army Will play the Crusaders hymn Beautiful Savior His passage May theamous Fire THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END And now we're going to hear more of the Salvation Army stirring battle music, the Staple Hill March, written by Captain Hector Main.
