It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scurney of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. Mayor Vittorio is rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Vittorio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable sindaco di New York, And with profundin 저声 of myương cresazi feel the truth of it, and it's half a piece of an anthem to be recognized with us. Every boy on this chair can make big Martinez and when it comes to evil people. But there are some things that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Europe and is coming to my city, she did not have only completed a good visit to all of us. She also has been in the city of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent by the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Genova ambasciadora of democracy. She is so dear to the people of the United States, but so dear to the Italians, especially the Genovese. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she was a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States and so every citizen of America, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come she has been able to to the city of high degrees representative. So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and to his mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is the statement of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic and has contributed to the rest of this man who belongs to the country and wants to welcome the support of this man and the population of the United States to the great people of the United States, to the great people of the United States, to which we are deeply grateful for, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made up to rid ourselves of democratic democratic liberties when we have intervened so presently in the war and to protect them today with many material sacrifices and men so that today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in all the world. And, onorevole Impeliteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work in this faith because the democratic democratic freedoms are really estes to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For some time we are not understanding, as if we remember when we had crossed been in the peaceful conflict We work for our country to build our country. It is with these sentiments, on the other side, that I salute you and the city of New York. And I say that we are tenacious in the work of the democracy in our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in search of your land is an example of all the Genoveses. Derisive, not credulous, contrasted by every man and the events of all of us, this man knew that this great land existed and looked at it desperately. He went to the mountains and the mountains and the mountains and the mountains, everywhere, everywhere, looking for the passage he wanted to find for the world to join the Christian cross. And it is not important if he then found the passage, if any one of us found the passage, if we have to persist, others will find the way, the way to find the way to find the way to be free, in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genovese, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which mean so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps it didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
