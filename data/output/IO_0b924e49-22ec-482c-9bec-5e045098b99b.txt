WNBC AM and FM New York start the day with Bob and Ray you can hear the boys between 6 and 8 30 every morning with records time temperature and a few characters like Mary Magoon Tex and anybody else who happens to wander into the studio the right way to start the day every day is with Bob and Ray and a laugh over WNBC this is Bill Leonard introducing the 36th program in a weekly series called plan for survival broadcast over the civil defense radio network this week's program was prepared for us by station WGR in Buffalo here's something to think about before you go to sleep tonight something for all of us to think about tonight tomorrow and the day after tomorrow maybe if we all think about it often enough we'll all do something about it of course some of us are doing something about it right now some of us that is but not enough not nearly enough and believe me gentle people the time is now now is the time because one atom bomb explosion in the center of a city the size of Buffalo New York would result in casualties ranging upwards from 40 to 60,000 that's right think it over you and you and you one atomic blast 40 to 60,000 dead and dying I repeat one atomic blast 40 to 60,000 dead and dying men women and children some of the people you know some of the people I know maybe you maybe me death and destruction and unless we're really ready panic in the streets okay so what are we going to do about it what happens if and when and where the bomb drops remember not too many years ago the Battle of Britain those darkest days when England seemed could not survive the dreadful death-filled weeks and months to come this is Broderick Crawford I think all of us know the story of the Battle of Britain I know I do because I saw some of it back in the days when I was a sergeant in the US Army you know in a lot of ways the men and women on Britain's home front undertook World War two's most difficult job unlike members of the armed forces they were forced to suffer the full fury of attack with no opportunity to fight back the civilians moved into action at the whale of a siren and with complete havoc on all sides brought order from confusion saved life and property and somehow managed to turn out the necessary weapons to fight a full-scale war sure England was saved by a large civilian army of two million men and women men and women baptized in fire and dedicated to a promise of blood sweat toil and tears but it took a long time for civil defense to catch on in England a long time in 1937 the air raid precautions act was passed calling for all local authorities of the British Isles to cooperate in forming an organization to build strong civilian defense units in every district the ARP emerged slowly until the Munich crisis in 1938 after which it developed into a little more closely knit organization some new volunteers came forward to help the few paid men ambulance first aid rescue and shelter units mobilized for action evacuation plans for women and children were quietly composed sirens wailed and the practice blackout was a common experience later in July of 1939 the Civil Defense Act was passed placing the entire organization on a statuatory basis the outbreak of total war on September 3rd 1939 found the ARP ready for complete mobilization but even at this late date public apathy still persisted several boroughs openly mocked routine air raid precautions and for a lot of people the idea of attack or invasion was something you read about that never happens it wasn't until the fall of France in the summer of 1940 that England's man in the street fully realized just where he stood in the world's greatest conflict and that's when he hurried to join the new army the civil defense army strongest bulwark in England's fight for survival that was the Battle of Britain and the part civilian defense played in the Battle of Britain someday we might have the same job to do right here right in the USA and we'd better be ready the Battle of Britain the big battle that was one at home had to be one at home the turning point in the history of the Second World War the problem is yesterday's Battle of Britain may be tomorrow's Battle of the USA a battle involving you and me and the people next door people in Buffalo people in Rochester and Syracuse and Albany a bloody battle a final battle and we must be ready I was a temporary warden in the ARP in the time was September 1941 I used to play bridge on my nights often it was this is Ivan and it was one of those nights with the happenings which I'm going to relate now took place we knocked off playing about two o'clock in the morning and a friend of mine and myself made our way homewards when after having walked about 10 minutes we suddenly saw a blinding flash in front of us and approaching the scene we saw that a gas of the fire in the house men had been hit and flames were spreading into the sky we circled the scene of destruction and after a further half an hour's walk we reached our home district when we suddenly began to notice a glow in the not so distant distance by the time we reached the house where we're staying at the time we saw that the church on the corner had been hit by high explosive bomb and there was a very great congregation raging people in the next door houses were loading furniture out in the street for fear that the fire might spread that actually did not happen but by the time morning arrived the church is completely burnt out the vicar and his warden had been killed and several people injured well Ivan just what was the reaction of the English people during the blitz did panic sort of strike them or did they take it calmly well generally speaking there was very little panic noticeable amongst the population mainly due to the fact that they had they had been extremely well informed by their newspapers as to the happenings but the most serious incidents that I recollect happened in late September 1944 when the bus bombs were over London the people in the east end as usual were wont to go to the underground stations for shelter and it was one evening when the people were making their way towards Bethner Green tube shelter when this particular thing occurred a bus bomb which had been circling above the area suddenly stopped drooling and that was invariably the signal that the explosion would take place within a number of seconds people started to rush the entrance to the underground and under the sudden impact the crash barrier broke and a woman with a baby in arms fell and people started trampling over her by the time the whole incident which didn't take more than 10 minutes was over over 180 people had been killed and several hundred injured it's pretty hard to imagine a full-scale air raid no matter what you've seen or heard or read it's pretty hard to imagine you and me and what we'll do and how we'll act if the day ever comes my first experience with civil defense was in 1943 when I was nursing we were receiving quite rigid training in firefighting and first aid and I often wondered this is Sheila Cox Winchmore Hill London well at least use it the information that we were receiving the rage at around that time was starting at Daskan went through until dawn and it was a summer night when the siren had already gone and I had already gone to bed that I heard a plane overhead and heard the dreaded sound of a bomb the whistle of a bomb it was a stick of bombs that fell and a stick of bombs being a group of several bombs yes it was usually five we had one about 50 feet from the nurse's home where I stayed and the other four were direct hits on the wall and the the wards of the hospital the the there was complete blackout and glass shattering all over the place and fires starting I think it was then that I realized how important my training had come in for the first thing I thought of was to start going around the about the duties that I had been told to perform so I went out found my way downstairs I was on the third floor and went out into the hospital grounds where I found indeed plenty of work to do and already the firefighters had started the firemen had arrived and the various units of the first aid had already got their canteens up and were starting to help those firemen who needed coffee etc and relief and it was then I realized how very important it was to know just what your job was where you were supposed to be and what you were supposed to do and and I went around my duties ministering first aid where it was needed and any other little things that I could do and I must say that those who of the patients who naturally were a little frightened of what was going on you could see the difference because they were quite panicky and didn't exactly know what to do or where to go and it was then that those people who had been trained in civil defense were able to help them thank you so much. Thank you Metal Chita. Thank you. Just razd Thank you Teresa for telling us of your experience during Blitz. Fran. Fran you were in London practically through the war weren't you? During the entire war. Yes, I was. What would you say was the biggest single thing you learned from your experiences during the raids? My own experience is that practice and training in fire prevention for a fire fighting outfit is the most important thing in order to avoid panic. You had a great deal of training. This is Francis Smith, Arry Road, Hempstead, London. ...tactical, which is only on paper or mobility when all the appliances move. I see. And on the end of August, the first daylight raid on London, Croydon was hit by a heavy explosive. Was it 1940? Yes. I was in the control room and we got the message through. And the only difference between the message and one of our exercises was that the one word exercise was omitted from the beginning and all the girls carried out their duties as though it were an exercise. We all wondered if that one word had been omitted by accident or if it was the real thing. Well, how is it that they hadn't heard the bombs fall or the wail of the siren? Oh, they were seven or eight miles away and we were underground, some 30 feet underground the Thames. I see. This was the... Underwater, not underground. Yes, but what... just how was the headquarters underwater? I don't understand. Well, the headquarters building is on the edge of the Thames. Mm-hmm. And to make a bomb-proof shelter for the key, the nerve center of the fire brigade, they put it right under the Thames. I see. About 30 feet under the water. 30 feet underwater. So you couldn't actually hear the bombs fall on the explosion? We could hear nothing at all. Mm-hmm. It's absolute soundproof. And you say in the bombing of Croydon, that was the first daylight raid. Yes. And how did you first learn that there had been a bombing? Well, we kept getting messages and every time this one word, exercise, was left out of the beginning of the message. And then we realized it was the real thing. And that way there was no panic at all because nobody knew just what had happened. You weren't about actually just... Yes. ...it had been just an exercise. Just another boring exercise. Uh-huh. And you experienced a great number of very terrible fires, didn't you, during the Blitz? Oh, yes, we did. I got out of the control room in November and started driving. I drove canteen vans. Oh. I drove petrol to fires. Uh-huh. For the... for the pumpers and so on? Yes, to keep the pumps moving. I see. What was the biggest fire that you experienced, Fran? That was St. Paul's Cathedral, when they had every appliance in London at the one fire. Uh-huh. And then they had fire appliances from all the surrounding towns covering the other fires in London. Oh, I see. They moved in from the communities around London. Yes. That was the mobilizing scheme. How long did the, uh, St. Paul's fire burn? Well, it was reported actually under control around 3 in the morning, I believe. And it had started about 7 in the evening. I see. But, of course, it burnt for days and days. Yes. And the firemen were cooling it down to get the last blaze or the last ember out. But you, uh, you're convinced that training is the important thing? It's the one important thing. It avoids panic. I wouldn't have liked to be a civilian and sat home every night listening to things. You felt much better. Oh, yes. And if you're a good job and you're part of a working outfit, it's much, much easier. Uh-huh. You know, all this talk is very unpleasant. Something nobody likes to think about. What's more, the next war, well, that's something different. Atomic war. Fortunately for your welfare and my welfare, plenty of people are thinking about the next war, the atomic war. More volunteer workers are needed now for training in every vital section of local civil defense. Workers for the medical section, transportation, rescue, shelter, evacuation, aircraft warning, administration, communications, supply, welfare and first aid, recruiting and training. Okay, what are we going to do next? Are we going to sit back and let an urgent call continue to go unheeded? Keep putting off our part in civil defense until tomorrow or the next day, next week or next month? Right now, some of us realize what civil defense means really means to our future security. But unfortunately, it seems most of us don't. Most of us aren't ready for volunteer civil defense work. Won't ever be ready until someday, one day when it might be too late. Yes, civil defense is something to think about before you go to sleep tonight. Something for all of us to think about. Tonight, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Maybe if we think about it often enough, we'll do something about it. Some of us are doing something about it right now. Some of us, that is. But not enough. Not nearly enough. And believe me, gentle people. The time is now. This is Bill Leonard to remind you again that civil defense is common sense. This is the Civil Defense Radio Network. This is the Civil Defense Radio Network. This is the Civil Defense Radio Network. This is the Civil Defense Radio Network. This is the Civil Defense Radio Network. For this you want to stop right now. What any of us are looking around at the very different places. Let's talk about it. We're going to make the government. It's all beautiful. It's a social mycket and healthy environment. Beautiful approach. We're going to create a special collaborative night together. But we have set to save such aiyetジョck ofativos this world as we do. We hooked make it into that whenever we keep the administration there. We left out Millen��. We end up! You hit anrift with told Sw بنzen .
