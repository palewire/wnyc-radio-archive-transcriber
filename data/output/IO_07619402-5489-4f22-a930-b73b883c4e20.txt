The honored dead. The sun has been shining hot and bright on the rolling plains of Texas and the great desert reaches of Arizona and New Mexico. The sun is gold on the creaming surf of California's coast. And Oregon and Washington and the Rocky Mountain states are lying cool and green with spring. The crops are growing greener through the Middle West. And Middle Western fields are red with clover. In Oklahoma's forests of gaunt derricks, the wells are pumping oil. The soft warm air of southern states are sweet with honeysuckle. The lush spring gardens of Atlantic seaboard states are crisp and wet with rain. New England is a haze of lilac blossoms now. And spring at last has come to Maine. This is the land they loved. The land their eyes had seen and saw again in the lull of battle. This is the land they dreamed of, longed for with all the hunger in their souls. This was the land for which they died. Long day on land be bright, with freedom's holy light, protect us by thy mind, with the country. This is their land, and May 30th is their day. The one day that most of these United States have dedicated to their memory. May 30th is the day the flags fly low for them, and the drums beat soft. And is the day the editorials with the deep black borders read, In Memoriam. Low intention with rubbles over a national lightning new dance. The scratching is close to the glory of the hesitations as Joel began to produce in the form of Stadt's Clue Larry L. They fought at Valley Forge, and their blood ran dark on the floor of the Alamo, and they fell on the slopes of San Juan Hill. Generation to generation, they have fought for what they loved and died for, what they believed in, fathers and sons. Bellow Wood is a family name now, and Shadow Theory belongs to the family too. Fathers and sons have crossed the Marne, and fathers and sons have spent their lives on the soil of France, rich with a lie dead. These are the men to whom this Memorial Day is dedicated. These men, and the men on the honor roll of the latest war, the men with the proud names. Colin P. Kelly, Alexander Neninger, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Leslie B. McNair, John Bassalone, Edward Butch O'Hare, Dead. All of them dead. And dead too are the men with the Polish names, the men with the Irish and English and German and Italian and Greek names, the men with the blood of a dozen different nations in their veins, who lost that blood for America. And the men with no names, the vast army of the unknown, the men who died without their dog tags, who were missing in action, who died unseen. Nobody knows how they died, what last heroic thing they may have done, or who they were. No one knows their names. We only know that they died fighting. Salerno Beach was bathed in Texas blood. Anzio Beach ran red with blood from Oklahoma. Blood from Michigan and Arkansas and Georgia seeped into a hill in Africa, known only by a number. The decks of battleships were wet with blood from Illinois and Kansas. And the dark earth of the Black Forest turned darker with the blood from California. Right. There's not a town in these United States that doesn't have a claim in some Pacific island or European battlefield. Not a town that hasn't lost its fighting dead. Not a state that hasn't so instilled its men with faith and vision that they'll die fighting for it. Some died without a chance to fight. They died eating. Or they died asleep. Some died in the slit trenches of islands whose names they didn't know how to pronounce. Some died not even knowing where they were. Names? Here are some names to think about. The— Kwajalein, Iwo Jima, the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, the Marianas, Belaloo, Okinawa, New Georgia, Guadalcanal, Kasserine Pass, Sicily, Messina, Casino, Rome, Cherbourg, Paris, the Siegfried Line, Bastogna, Berlin and Tokyo. Names and phrases, the last message from Corregidor. From here it looks like firing ceased on both sides. Men here all feeling bad because of terrific nervous strain of the siege. Corregidor used to be a nice place. It's haunted now. Withstood a terrific pounding. Just made broadcast to Manila to arrange meeting for surrender. Talk made by General Beebe. I can't say much. Can't think at all. I can hardly think. Say, I have 60 pesos you can have for this weekend. The white flag is up. Everyone is bawling like a baby. The G.I. who had trained in England for months for D-Day. The G.I. who was back in England D-Day, bloody with his future shattered. The bitter G.I. who was asked by a correspondent where he'd been. The simple, heartbroken answer. In France, for 10 minutes. The forward observer who gave his gun battery target ranged with quick precision. When the voice on the other end of the line protested, Hey, that's your position. The unimpassioned answer. Yeah? It's the German position, too. At best time, the sharp pistol-shot reply to the German demand for surrender. Nuts! Nuts! Nuts! Nuts! Nuts! Nuts! Nuts! You can't say that they didn't care if they died. They cared tremendously. They wanted desperately to live. They were afraid of the pain of death. And they were even more afraid of not dying. Of living a mutilated half-life. They hoped that if something had to happen, it would happen quick and clean. But they didn't know. They only knew they'd have to take their chances. So they sweated it out and watched their comrades fall around them. And when they saw a friend go down, they'd think of the little things he'd said. Man, when I get home, I'm gonna get a car and drive all over the doggone country. There's no place on earth like America. No place at all. You can have the rest of it. I'll take America. America and a nice gal for a wife. And a little house of our own. Make it with roses. Yeah, definitely with roses. His is an unmarked grave. And the chances are there are no roses. When you're fighting a war, you think a lot about the things you've heard the other guys say. You know, lying here sweating it out, there's one thing I hope. If we get it, I sure hope someone will tell them back home for us what we fought this thing for. I sure hope someone tells them for us what kind of a country we want it to be. Oh. He didn't have to sweat it out for long. he had it, really had it. Well, that's what we hoped at the end. But maybe he really doesn't need someone to tell him back home what kind of an America he wanted, what kind of an America he fought for. He was American. It was American blood that pounded through his veins, and this was an American heart. But for his dead heart and all the rest on foreign fields, there are thousands more back home, and deep within each one there is the same burning desire for the same kind of America. That's our memorial to them. And what we'd do about it would be our memorial in the years to come. To the Johnnies and Jacks and Joes who never came back, they gave all that they had to give, and ours is the sacred heritage. The only death it asks is our monumental best. When you guide them, there are feet rally round our liberty and the bands of promise joy, teeth and safety we shall find. Miss a child championship.
