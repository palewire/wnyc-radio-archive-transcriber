Turning Chief Joint United States Military Aid in Greece. There was to have been a very elaborate parade up Broadway, but naturally those of you who have a view of the weather know quite well by this time that the parade and all had to be postponed. Traffic, of course, is greatly congested because of the situation that prevails, and General Van Vliet has been delayed getting to City Hall as well, even coming directly from his hotel to the City Hall. The Honorable Grover Ray Whelan is Chairman of the Mayor's Committee today, and a very interesting program has been arranged to honor General Van Vliet here in City Hall. They're taking a few moments now to take pictures as the entourage comes up to the stairway of City Hall, and in a few moments Mr. Whelan will conduct his guest into the Council Chamber here in City Hall. Those participating will be His Excellency Athanese Politis, Greek Ambassador to the United States, and, of course, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York, will greet the distinguished guest, and then Lieutenant General James Van Vliet, United States Military Aid in Greece, will reply. The Police Glee Club will entertain as they usually do on these state occasions in City Hall, and the Honorable William O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York, will present a scroll of honor to the guest today. The Department of Sanitation Band, Maestro Celebrate Conducting, is the band organization that will observe the anthem and the instrumental features. And now the Cortesians coming into City Hall.

Oh, say does that the flag of the flag of the flag, for the land of the free, and the home of the brave. And now, Mr. Whelan. Mr. Mayor, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a great privilege for those of us who know the guest of honor today to see him looking so well after his strenuous service as the head of the United States military mission in Greece. Mayor O'Dwyer, you know him as an old friend who spent several years at Governor's Island, and whom we all found to be one of the most cooperative of the military authorities that served in this area. It's a great pleasure for me, Mr. Mayor, to present to you at this time, General James Van Fleet. Good evening, Your Honor. William O'Dwyer. Mr. Whelan, on the return of General Van Fleet to his homeland after such distinguished service, I agree with you that we are delighted to find that he has survived the rigors of his most recent assignment so well. And to him and to Mrs. Van Fleet, New York City pours out its heart in gratitude and welcome for what they mean to us and to the world. Any democratic nation would be proud to have a leader whose character, training, and experience have produced the very best combination of the humanitarian, the statesman, and the fighting general. Such a man is our honored guest here today. And on behalf of the people of the city of New York, I welcome home General and Mrs. James A. Van Fleet. We are not only happy to have him back in our city, where as the commanding general, headquarters at Governor's Island, we had such pleasant relations. But we are proud to accord him a well-deserved hero's welcome. As chief of the American military mission to Greece, appointed by President Truman, General Van Fleet has rendered extraordinary service to the United States and to the United Nations. His guidance of Greek army leaders in a Cold War that turned out very hot was directly responsible for the Greek people's successful struggle against communist aggression. General Van Fleet was chosen for this important post because of his brilliant record as one of the outstanding generals of World War Number Two. He was responsible for bringing in war material and civilian supplies allocated to Greece under the Truman Doctrine. We all know how well he accomplished this mission. And history will record the humanitarian contribution made by General Van Fleet and the struggle by the Greek people to remain free. His brilliant statesmanship is best reflected by the manner in which he aided the Greek army in throwing off its political shackles and thereby paving the way for the restoration of General Papagos as chief of staff. As a consequence, the Greeks were unified and they fought in the glorious tradition of their 2,500-year struggle against oppression. There followed the rout of the communists from Greece and the abandonment of their attempts, temporarily at least, to penetrate into Western Europe. But for the indomitable spirit of the Greek people and the leadership of General Van Fleet, other nations in Europe today might well be under communist domination. From General Van Fleet's enviable record in World War Number Two, his latest achievement might well have been expected. He served in practically all of the critical places in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, under such distinguished Army commanders as Bradley and Hodges, Simpson, Girard, and Pat. It was not by accident that the 8th Infantry Regiment, trained by and under command of General Van Fleet, was selected as the spearhead in a history-making landing at Utah Beach on D-Day. Campaigns that sang low, the capture of Brest, the Third Army's final counteroffensive in the Battle of the Bulge, the Remargan Bridgehead, that operation, all bear the stamp of General Van Fleet's superb leadership. Campaigns that are the most important and important in the battle of the British Army, Wounded three times in the service of his country, General Van Fleet has earned the reputation of being a soldier's soldier. His numerous decorations include the distinguished service cross, the distinguished service medal, the Legion of Merit, the Silver Star, the Bronze Star for Valor, the Purple Heart, the French Legion of Honor, and the Croix de Guerre. Ladies and gentlemen who are in this historic old room presenting this warm, heartfelt reception to General Van Fleet, and to those of you who are not here but who are listening to me attempt to express the greeting of our city to our distinguished visitors, I know of no medal yet struck that can adequately express the nation's appreciation of the valiant contribution in the not-so-cold war against Communist aggression. But I know full well that when this declaration is made, the name of General Van Fleet will be remembered. I speak today with the full knowledge that I am expressing the thoughts of every freedom-loving man and woman within our city in giving this welcome to the General and to Mrs. Van Fleet, to thank them for their contributions, and to wish them years of mutual love and affection and happiness to enjoy the fruits of the great labors that have been accomplished. I have now the honor to present to General Van Fleet on behalf of the City of New York this citation. General Van Fleet. The Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, is now taking his orders from the photographers while General Van Fleet is being bestowed with the citation. The Office of the Mayor, City of New York, know all men by these presents that I, William O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York, to hereby cite for distinguished and exceptional public service, General James A. Van Fleet, whose public benefactions in defense of human liberty as chief of the American military mission for Greece, were in a large measure, were in a large measure directly responsible for the successful struggle of free people against communist aggression, and that they have enlisted the heartfelt gratitude and deep appreciation of the people of the City of New York. The Mayor is now handing the scroll to General Van Fleet, and the photographers are asking for a few special pictures, and the Mayor very obligingly turns the scroll around so it will be visible when the picture is taken, with the seal of the City of New York and the colors of the city attached to the seal. The General himself is a tall, handsome man, and he makes a very splendid appearance here in this beautiful room, the Council Chamber in City Hall. How many people realize the true beauty of the interior of this building, which is such a perfect setting for a formal reception such as today? And looking down on the scene is the $350,000 valued portrait of Lafayette by a great creator in communications, Mr. C. W. Morse, the man who invented the telegraph and yet was also a fine artist, because the Marquis de Lafayette himself, who did so much to help Washington at that time in the early beginnings of our country, said the Marquis made the statement that this was the finest portrait that he had had painted anywhere in the world. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the privilege to present our guest of honor, General Van Fleet. Thank you very much. Mr. Mayor, your grace, and my dear friends of the City of New York and of Greece, the warmth and bigness and sincerity of your welcome overwhelms me and Mrs. Van Fleet. And I am really so deeply moved, I do not know just how I can adequately respond to the mayor's remarks. It is wonderful to be here in New York City and breathe again the bigness of the people of this country and be among you. I want you to know that it was little that I did to deserve this praise from the city. It is rather the people of this country who supported the president in his Truman Doctrine, which made it possible for Greece to wage war against communist aggression. And then finally, and foremost, it was the spirit of the Greeks themselves who had to give of their blood and property to win against red aggression. It was a great thing for me to be in New York shortly after the war, stationed at Governor's Island, and know something of the bigness of this country and especially of this world capital. A great town, a great service town, but a town that is so generous in its heart, so great in its spirit, so free with its freedoms that it makes us so happy, so proud to be in New York City. My father was a New Yorker 60 years ago, and so I deeply appreciated being here three years ago to breathe a little bit of the town which he loved so much. Yes, the Greeks are great people. They are noble people. They are spirited people. They are free people. And they love all the decent things that human beings should be. Greece, which gave democracy to the world. Greece, which in recent years has showed the world how to die if necessary to defend that democracy. And Greece, during the time that I was over there, showing the world again how to give of their lives and property to say no, to defend that no against red aggression. It is that independent spirit of the Greeks who will back up their conviction with their lives, the world again how to defend that no against red aggression. The world again is a great people, and the world again is a great people, which should make us proud that we are allied with them. For many years, Greece was the only nation that was engaged in a shooting war against red aggression. Now, I've often been asked what would have happened had they not gotten American aid through the Truman Doctrine. And my reply has been, it would have been a catastrophe for Greece and for all the West of decent living nations. But Greece would not have been conquered, overrun, yes, occupied, yes, but never conquered. Greece has never been conquered, although she has been occupied for centuries by hostile countries. Greece poured out lots of blood to win their freedom again. The casualties in this war have been just over 100,000. So it has been, after all, a rather large war, a great contribution for a little country to make to maintain her freedoms. Now, Greece believes in those freedoms like she did 2,500 years ago. It's the same Greek. It's the same people. The Greek is a sturdy, independent, intelligent, alert race. They are a Christian race. They believe in all the righteous and just things that humans should do. They despise evil like anyone should despise the devil. So with that power can be said. They are liberal, as we started out there. Here are somethin' little things that weren't attended to the locked air, where they are farts.

The training was through the supervision, by the supervision of the American mission. So we in America can properly take credit for the aid, the physical aid, and some of the advice that was furnished. For much of the morale, let it come from the king, let it come from the church, let it come from the good people of Greece who would die, who will ever die for a cause. And let the fighting go to the Greek, who is a good soldier, give him tools and the training. Let the leadership go again to the king and to his appointments in command of the armed forces. And to that great military genius of today, Field Marshal Alexander Papagas. A man who I consider one of the great military men of our age. And after all, while not a politician, a great statesman for the good of his country. Now, gentlemen, please do not give me the credit. I appreciate the great welcome. I appreciate the splendid praise which his honor the mayor has made in his address. But this is a Greek day and that credit should go to our American taxpayer and to the Greek spirit, who after all, he's the man who did the work. It's a Greek victory, not an American one. And may I say that Greek will be on our side forever on the side of decency to defend those freedoms which he and we believe so dearly in. I want to say in conclusion, we should be proud of Greece. We should be glad that we helped him. The Greek nation and people appreciated the American help and the Greek people and nation made effective use of it.
