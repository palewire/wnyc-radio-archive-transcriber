Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. Two vote spouses. The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The National Anthem of Italy and the National Anthem of our own country, very brightly played by the New York City Police Department Band. Now here is Mr. Coleman. Yes. Mayor Impoletari, it is my distinct honor and privilege today to present to you and through you, the people of the City of New York, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of Genoa, Italy. Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The Mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. when he was elected mayor of Genoa last year. He defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success and when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scarnie of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And, Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor the City's Gold Medal of Honor on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome looking man accepting the congratulations of the Mayor and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Pertuzio is about six feet two I would say weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. Honorable Honorable Sindaco of New York of New York is with profound commotion that I heard with my thoughts There are facts and acts that men have a unique meaning, but there are some acts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, came to Europe and came to my city, she did not have only made a cordial visit to all of us. She also gave her homage to the mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is also venu to Genova ambasciatore di democrazia, di quella democrazia che è così cara agli uomini degli Stati Uniti, ma che è così cara, disperatamente cara agli italiani, ai genovesi soprattutto. Per questo, Hon. Impiniteri, noi le siamo stati grati, perché lei è stata testimonianza e documento della democrazia che vige negli Stati Uniti, per cui ogni cittadino americano, indipendentemente dalle sue origini e delle sue classi sociali, può pervenire, come lei è pervenuto, ad alti gradi rappresentativi della città. Così, questa mia visita non è soltanto una risposta, non è soltanto una visita di cortesia, Hon. Impiniteri. Questa mia visita vuole essere il saluto della città di Cristoforo Colombo alla più grande città degli Stati Uniti e al suo sindaco, che ha avuto così grande successo a Genova e in Italia. Vuole essere soprattutto la affermazione di un uomo che appartiene alla nuova vita democratica italiana e che ha contribuito modestamente a ricostituirla. Vuole essere il saluto di quest'uomo e della popolazione italiana al grande popolo degli Stati Uniti, alla democrazia degli Stati Uniti, alla quale noi siamo profondamente grati, perché conosciamo tutti i sacrifici che questo popolo ha compiuto per ridarci delle libertà democratiche quando è intervenuto così possentemente nella guerra e per tutelarle oggi con tanti sacrifici materiali e di uomini anche, per cui oggi si può dire che gli Stati Uniti hanno assunto nel mondo il patrocinio della democrazia ed hanno operato intelligentemente perché difendere la democrazia in Europa è difenderla realmente in tutto il mondo. Ebbene, onorevole Impeliteri, onorevole sindaco di New York, è con questa fede che noi lavoriamo, perché le libertà democratiche siano veramente estese a tutto il mondo e vi sia pace e lavoro per tutti. Non è facile il nostro compito. Forse talvolta noi italiani non siamo compresi. Bisogna ricordare che la ricostruzione della democrazia in Italia è avvenuta proprio nel momento in cui noi eravamo gravati dal peso della sconfitta. Città care avevamo perduto, territori nei quali il nostro lavoro poteva espletarsi, miserie e rovine, ma l'attaccamento a questa forza, l'attaccamento a questa fede democratica era così vivo che noi abbiamo ripreso il nostro lavoro. Abbiamo lavorato, lavoriamo, disperatamente lavoriamo per ricostruire moralmente e materialmente il nostro Paese. È con questi sentimenti, onorevole Impeliteri, che io saluto lei e la città di New York e le dico che siamo tenaci nell'opera di ricostruzione della democrazia nel nostro Paese. Siamo tenaci. E abbiamo degli esempi. Abbiamo degli esempi soprattutto a Genova. La tenacia di Colombo nel ricercare la vostra terra è un esempio a tutti i genovesi. Deriso, non creduto, contrastato da ogni avversità, dagli uomini e dagli avvenimenti, quest'uomo sapeva che questa grande terra esisteva e l'ha cercata disperatamente. È andato assondando alle foci dei fiumi, è andato cercando negli estuari, ovunque cercando quel passaggio che lui voleva trovare per congiungere tutto il mondo sotto la croce cristiana. Ebbene, non importa se lui poi non ha trovato il passaggio, non importa se ognuno di noi non trova il passaggio, bisogna persistere altri, troverà la strada, la strada perché tutto il mondo sia libero in pace e nel lavoro. Grazie. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Jenner, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which mean so much to us and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities which is with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties but we have been working hard to this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe we all believe that in spite of all difficulties we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first but in the end we shall succeed we shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome.
