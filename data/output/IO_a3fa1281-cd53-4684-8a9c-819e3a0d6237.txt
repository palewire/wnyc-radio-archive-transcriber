The day he would come with a strong-headed dog, as the band stayed on. He's like from the floor, with a girl he adored as the band stayed on. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded, the poor girl would shake me along. He carries a girl with a tall-headed dog, as the band stayed on.

And the moon's not my window, and the sea's not been here. For the land's not our heart is balanced, but the sea's not the true. And the moon's not the true, the lovely girl I endued. Sweet Rosie O'Grady, my dear little rose. She's my steady lady, most everyone knows. And when we are married, how happy we'll be. For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady, and Rosie O'Grady loves me. It's the ghost of a time, it's the ghost of a time. Going through the shady lake, with a lady's light. To hold her hand and feel good, and that's a very good sign. The sea's not good, they won't sing the ghost of a time. As I walk along the Wapu Long, with an independent air. You can hear the girls declare, he must be a millionaire. You can hear them sigh and wish to die. You can see them wish the other eye. At the man that broke the bank at Mantecarlo. As I walk along the Wapu Long, with an independent air. You can hear the girls declare, the ghost of a millionaire. You can hear the sky and wish to die. The sea's not good, they won't sing the other eye. The land that broke the bank at Mantecarlo. The sea's not bad, they won't sing the other side. The sea's not good, they won't sing the other side. You can hear themiction, you can hear them cry. I be afraid of that my eyes are apology. The glory of the day. Give them bells. Give them bells. Bring it up the glory of the day. The glory of the day. The glory of the day. The glory of the day. The glory of the day. The glory of the day.

They were sisters. We were brothers. And learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad. Who won your father's home. Became your mother. I married the other. But we have ripped her apart. She was bred in old Kentucky. Where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country. In her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I too. Comrade, comrade. Never since we were boys. Sharing each other's sorrows. Sharing each other's joy. Comrade, when manhood was running. They blew all their eyes behind. When they just read us, my darling. Oh, comrade, what's there by my side? There's a name that's never spoken. And a mother's heart have broken. There is just another missing From the old home that we belong. There is still a memory living. There's a father unforgiving. And a figure that he moons, And a love, que resentment tornado. I'm home. She's my sweetheart, I'm her beau. She's my Annie, I'm her beau. Good real valley, never before. The river I need is my sweetheart. One evening in the month of May, I met old Satan on the way. I looked old Satan in the eye. If you want to get to heaven when you die. If you want to get to heaven in the good old way. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home. I'm home.
