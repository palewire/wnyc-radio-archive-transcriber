I am down here at the dispatch office of the Whitehall Street Terminal working out the final schedules and I can say officially that normal six boat ferry service will be resumed at 3.30 p.m. today, August the 13th. I would like to take this opportunity to express particular appreciation to the people of Staten Island for their forbearance, understanding and cooperation during the rush hours this morning when unauthorized absenteeism reduced the ferry schedule to two boats during the rush hours. Through teamwork and direct supervision, we were able to get all commuters New York bound by 9.45 a.m., which in view of the situation that confronted us was a fine tribute to Captain William M. McGuire, the director of our ferry service and his experienced operational staff. I had been down at St. George with Deputy Commissioner Alexander Pete Chopin since 5 o'clock this morning. We got things and ordered down there to the extent we were able and then conferred with the union leadership at my office at 11 a.m. I personally and directly and urgently requested that the union leadership direct all men to return to work immediately.

And an appreciation of the conscientious aid and assistance which we in the department have given the union and their negotiations for a new labor contract. They responded and directed all those who remained from their post during the rush hours this morning to return to work immediately. Ive told me that. I was really proud of that. When I 앞 approached him my sister at Dennis Leonard Duncan he said he took care of me and he was completely kвон�ton next to me. And as he reached the end theiad in hisesy, never really? This body in theắm had been determined, but his friend still had a very much loved one where I was the mission to the stage.
