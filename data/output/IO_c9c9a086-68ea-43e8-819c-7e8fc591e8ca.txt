Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air It proved through the night That a flag was still there Oh, say the dawn's that star-spangled That are yet wave O'er the land of the free And the home of the brave Chief Clerk Vincent Finn Will now step forward And administer the oath To the candidates Can you 9 policewomen step up? Raise your right hand Raise your right hand Do you and each of you solemnly swear That you will support the Constitution of the United States The Constitution of the State of New York And that you will faithfully discharge the duties of the Office of Policewoman On probation In the Police Department of the City of New York According to the best of your ability Do each of you so swear?

Drop your hand Ladies and gentlemen Ladies and gentlemen This is a happy time for me as police commissioner To attend these ceremonies To attend these ceremonies When this morning 816 men and women are added to the department I am very grateful to his honor, Mayor Impeletere And the Board of Estimate For making this possible Because We all know that we've been sorely in need Of more policemen The mayor has known it for a long time And despite Despite The serious financial obstacles of the city He and the Board of Estimate Have bent their every energy To keep the police department up to its full quota I am also thankful to the mayor and the Board of Estimate For making the part of policemen Considerably easier during the past year They have been given an additional 6 days of vacation They've had several salary increases It's much better today when you men and women are coming into the department Than it was several years ago You're coming into a great department One of the finest of its kind in the whole world You're going to be assigned to the police academy For some very stiff courses The police academy is manned by the finest talent we can possibly get I can't tell you to earnestly To pay attention during your course of training Take it seriously Because It's laying a solid foundation for you the rest of your years in the department And I presume that the reason you're here this morning is because you want to make a career as a policeman It's an honorable career You get security And you get the respect of the people So Mark my words well men and women Let these next few months be serious and intensive months In years to come when you try exams for promotions The sergeant, lieutenant, captain If you get a solid foundation now It will last you all the years in the department I now have the honor and the pleasure Of presenting to you One of the greatest friends the department has ever had The honor of Mayor Vincent Aron Pelletieri Commissioner Monaghan, Chief Rathangas, Chief Lurie My colleagues on the Board of Estimates Burr President Lundy of Queens Burr President Lyons of Bronx County Deputy Commissioners And you young ladies and gentlemen Who have just been sworn in As members of the New York City Police Department I am very happy to join Commissioner Monaghan In welcoming you men and women Into the ranks of the New York City Police Department You will now start to serve your city As members of one of the greatest organizations of its kind in the entire world I congratulate each one of you on your appointment As Mayor, I have pledged myself to a program of providing the fullest protection to our people at all times I have pledged that this program shall be carried through In so doing, we must also keep in mind That policemen and policewomen Are entitled to the same benefits And the same good working conditions That are offered to other employees of the government of the City of New York I am highly pleased therefore To announce That with your appointment today The Police Department Will be able to put into effect A shorter work week for policemen Beginning shortly after midnight January 4th I have worked closely with policemen for many years And know full well Of the many sacrifices and long hours of service That they have given in the faithful performance of their beauty And I feel that because of their unspenting service The members of the Police Department Are fully entitled to improve working conditions The appointment of you men and women today Brings the actual strength of the police force To 19,611 Within the very near future I hope that we will be able to raise the quota To 20,372 Established by the Board of Estimates And the Budget Direction I might add That these new working conditions A great number of promotions A great number of new appointments Made to the police department Within the last two years And particularly during the last year Could not have been achieved Were it not For the enthusiastic cooperation Of your very able police commissioner George Monaghan And I might add That unless Your mayor and the police commissioner Had the cooperation And the vote Of the unanimous membership Of the Board of Estimates None of these things Would have come to pass The entire Board of Estimates Joins with me In these sentiments I have expressed About the police department And we intend to see to it That the funds will be provided So that the police department Will be brought up To full quota To the end That the people of the city of New York Will receive full and adequate And adequate police protection My only word of advice to you Is to follow the instructions Of your police commissioner And of experienced police officers Who will be in charge of your training At the police academy If you follow those instructions I am certain You will survive the course And be present with us On graduation day In the very near future You're starting off at a good time You're starting off With a good omen Because frankly When commissioner Monaghan suggested to me That we have these exercises Outdoors today On December 30th of 1952 I was a little hesitant Because I said commissioner I don't know what the weather will be I don't know whether or not We'll be able to have the exercises At city hall plaza And if not I don't know where we can get a hall Big enough Around city hall To accommodate Something like Eight or nine hundred new appointees To the police department And Within the next few days Or the next few weeks There'll be another Approximately One hundred or one hundred and fifty new appointments That would be here today Except for the fact that there are applications And qualifications And qualifications Have not been processed as yet But I had A little bit of hesitancy about it So evidently the commissioner was right The good lord was with you New members of the police department And we have Almost A summer's day's weather To welcome You into the police department The city of New York So you're starting off Clean off With a good omen Good luck And god bless That was the mayor of the city of New York The honorable Vincent Arm Pelletere Now
