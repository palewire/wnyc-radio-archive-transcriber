Radio's microphones are over here at Kingston Atlantic Avenue and St. Andrew's Place for the dedication of really and truly a magnificent playground, the St. Andrew's Playground. The Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable Vincent R. Impelletary, escorted by Commissioner Robert Moses, the Borough President of Brooklyn, the Honorable John Cashmore, and a distinguished company has just come in now, and the neighborhood is having a wonderful time making the acquaintance of its civic family, and it's taking a few moments before the introduction. In a few moments, Mr. Sherry, Executive Officer of the Park Department, will introduce Commissioner Moses, but there is still a little handshaking and greeting here under the beautiful sunshine and blue skies of this section of the Borough of Brooklyn, the greatest borough in the city of New York. Well, I don't mean to cause any rivalry, but it is a wonderful borough, isn't it? And when you get a sunshiny, clear day, blue skies in a playground like we have out here at St. Andrew's Avenue, why we're bound to be enthusiastic. The Park Department has made the most beautiful display here of palms and potted plants around the speaker's platform, and now Mr. Sherry is ready to make the introduction. Mr. Sherry. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We will open the ceremonies by singing our national anthem, accompanied by the Department of Sanitation Band. Good morning, 세계. Food and game. Good afternoon, guy. Good afternoon, everybody. 차� OMG. ¶¶ It is an honor and a pleasure to introduce the Park Commissioner, the Honorable Robert Moses. The invocation will be offered by the Rabbi Max Schenk of the Temple, Shari Zedek. Please rise. Our Father in Heaven, we, Thy children of all races and creeds, stand here today united in brotherhood and prayer. We thank Thee for all the goodness and bounty Thou dost shower upon us day by day, for the sheer joy of being alive, of basking in the glorious sunshine and the pleasantness of this day vouchsafed unto us. Above all, as we are about to dedicate this playground to the children of our community, provided for them and for us by our great city, we pledge ourselves and consecrate ourselves anew to the underlying idea and essence of our American democracy, one nation, one community, indivisible, in liberty, and with justice for all. Mayest Thou, O God, bless America, all those who guide and who lead us through this period of national crisis and international emergency. Bless our beloved Mayor, our beloved Borough President, and Commissioner, and all those who have labored to bring this community center to us. Protect our sons and daughters now serving in the armed forces of the United Nations, that they may be restored in safety and good health into the midst of their families and their dear ones. And above all, may peace come to all the nations and peoples of the earth, that we may live together and work together in amity and friendship for the establishment of Thy kingdom on earth. For all this, from the bottom of our hearts, we thank Thee. And let us humbly and hopefully say, Amen. Thank you for running, papa. The Department of Parks is now taking its place before the stand. And in just a moment you'll hear the voice of Commissioner Moses taking over as chairman and introducing the regular order of program. In the meantime, the flags are being placed and the wonderful turnout from the neighborhood is located here at the St. Andrews Playground at Kingston, Atlantic and St. Andrews Place in the Borough of Brooklyn. The Borough President of the Great Borough of Brooklyn, Borough President Cashmore, the Mayor and its distinguished citizens of the Royal Presidents. Now Mr. Moses. The first speaker, the Honorable Bertram L. Baker, a member of the State Assembly. His Honor the Mayor, our beloved Borough President, Commissioner Moses, the representatives of our district, the Honorable Stephen J. Carney and Mrs. Catherine Smith, other distinguished guests, my friends and neighbors, but most important of all, the children of our community. We are gathered together this afternoon to celebrate with you the dedication of this playground as just another contribution of democracy to the youth of our community and our great city. A contribution which will help to build in them robust bodies and sound minds so that our children of today may become men and women of tomorrow with sterling characters. We, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area, and particularly in this portion of it known as the 17th Assembly District, today are realizing the fulfillment of a dream of many years, which has only been made possible because groups of people with a common community interests work together. And secondly, because the head of our great borough, the Honorable John Cashmore, always lent an attentive air to the pleas and desires of these people who represented the community. And third, because our city council, the Board of Estimate, our Park Commissioner, and our Mayor finally approve the plans for this beautiful project. And so as we pass it on to you, our children, our young people, we place upon your shoulders a great responsibility. The responsibility of protecting it at all times, protecting it from vandalism. It is yours to use, not to abuse. And to the parents, we also place upon your shoulders a responsibility. The responsibility of supervision. The responsibility of guidance. The responsibility of cooperation with our law enforcement agencies. The responsibility ofbia. The responsibility of protecting the Enemy of the dzie color of art as an el scripture.

I am into these lästumbединst��� and miss their wonderful knowledge." Baker. This is a pretty big town. And in order to get the point of view of the several boroughs with their various and differing interests, the makers of the new charter as well as the makers of the old one decided very wisely that there had to be a top man in the borough. So they provided for the election of a borough president. Now in our work in the park department under the direction of the mayor, we've made it a practice to consult the borough presidents on these improvements because they know their boroughs better than we do. In this case, in Brooklyn, we have had the continuous and undeviating cooperation of John Cashmore. He knows his Brooklyn, he knows the people in it, he knows the changes that are going on and the needs as they arise from time to time. In this case, again, he's been a very prominent factor in bringing about this improvement and others in this neighborhood. I don't need to tell you how difficult it is in old, congested, settled parts of town to acquire land for any public purpose. That's become our big problem in construction of all public works, schools, playgrounds, hospitals, highways, moving people, and doing it in a decent, orderly, humane way, finding places for them that are at least as good and preferably better than those they've had. So when we find, as we do occasionally, an orphan asylum such as the one that stood here and wanted to move out the country, St. John's not far away, where we can negotiate with the heads of the institutions and get land by voluntary agreement and purchase, not by condemnation, and not have a problem of moving people because that's a problem they take on themselves. We feel that we're very lucky and we were in this instance. I take great pleasure now in presenting the president of your borough, John Cashmore. Thank you, Commissioner Moses, Reverend Clergy, Mayor Impelletary, Mr. Steve Carney, Mrs. Catherine Smith, and neighbors and friends. Well, for many years, the people of this neighborhood, known as the Bedford-Stuyveson area, wanted another park. And on November the 29th last year, we broke ground for this park. Now this is three and a half acres, and let's take a look at what we got. As Bob Moses said, we did a good job on acquiring the old Brooklyn North and the North and the Asylum. The assessed valuation of that property was $167,000. But Bob Moses, being a shrewd trader and a great adjuster, got it for $92,500. The cost of the construction of this great playground is $275,000. Now what are you going to have in here? We're going to have some swings. We're going to have some seesaws. We're going to have a wading pool for the youngsters. We're going to have a roller skating rink. In the wintertime, we're going to have an ice skating rink. We're going to have two softball courts. And at the same time, we're going to have two handball courts. Now if you want any more than that, move out of Brooklyn. Now this is the fourth park and playground that we've opened in the borough of Brooklyn this year. This makes 161 parks and playgrounds in your borough. And it just means that there's no other community in the United States that can half match the parks and the playgrounds that we have here in our borough, in the borough. Thanks to Bob Moses and his great staff. Now what is this for? And let me put the cards on the table for you. There's a great deal of talk about juvenile delinquency. Well, there's no cure for juvenile delinquency unless we all cooperate and work together. The city surely today is doing its share for juvenile delinquency. We're doing everything we can to prevent it. But there's also three other conditions. One is the training in the home and the responsibility of the parents. The other is our great school system. And the third, which is very important, is our churches. Now there isn't anyone here on this platform that bothers whether you're a Catholic, a Protestant, or a Jew. But you must have religion. And religion starts in the home. And for you youngsters out there, I want to say this to you. Select your companions wisely and carefully. And if you want to give your mother or your father a great present on Mother of Father's Day, if you don't have the price of a little handkerchief or a necktie, get up early on a Sunday morning and say, Mom, I'm going to go to church this morning. I'll be the greatest present you can give her. Now this wouldn't be possible, this park or this playground, without two men. We got enough credit in Brooklyn so that we can distribute it all around. And he's got control of the Board of Estimate. And how these things start is, first, it's got to go on a calendar for us to acquire the property. And if the mayor says no, confidentially it's no. But he said yes to this. And the next king comes along as one of the greatest trial lawyers in America, although he's not a lawyer. And that's Bob Moses. And Bob Moses stands before the Board of Estimate in executive session. And if you could hear him plead for parks and playgrounds, for the future of America, and that's you children out there, you've got a great champion. Everyone in the United States, not only in Brooklyn, concedes that Bob Moses has the ability and the qualifications that's only once in a lifetime for one man for one entire generation. And we're living in his time. Let's give a hand to Bob Moses. In conclusion, I want to say this. We all run for public office. This is not our money. This is your money. Remember it. And remember when you use this playground, use it just the same as though your mother and father bought it for you. Don't destroy anything, but bring your friends over here and grow up to be borough presidents of Brooklyn. Thank you. Thank you very much, John. I now give you the mayor. Ladies and gentlemen, the dedication of this new playground and recreation area is a very important event for the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and the adjoining communities where the need for additional recreation facilities has been so very acute for a long time. Therefore, I am of course happy indeed to join our distinguished Park Commissioner, Bob Moses, our Borough President of Brooklyn, John Cashmore, the Reverend clergy who are present, Mr. Connie and Mrs. Smith, and the other distinguished participants at these exercises. I am happy to report that this is the 25th playground actually completed and opened to the public during my administration as mayor. And with its addition, there are now in the city of New York New York 552 playgrounds in our expanded park system. and as Borough President Cashmore pointed out, there's no city in the entire United States that can boast of that kind of a park system. In addition to that, the city has provided in the current budget for the development of 33 additional playgrounds, of which 13 are now under construction, and beyond that are 61 city-owned playground sites for which plans have been prepared and which await construction funds. This new playground will provide recreational facilities for all age groups and will serve both the residents and the school children of the surrounding congested community, which is intensely developed with two- and three-story homes. The nearest playground is over a quarter of a mile distant. It might be interesting to point out that the major portion of this property was formerly occupied by the Brooklyn Orphan Asylum, which was operated for over 75 years by the Orphan Society of Brooklyn as a non-sectarian orphanage where many, many thousands of children were befriended and given educational opportunities to become responsible citizens. In 1942, the Society moved to new quarters in East Islip, Long Island, and the Brooklyn buildings were leased for a period of one year to the Army for housing of soldiers. At the conclusion of the Army occupancy, the Society felt that the property should continue to be used for some purpose that would benefit the people of Brooklyn. They then decided to offer the property to the city for a park for $92,400, which was approximately 60% of the assessed valuation of the land only. This, of course, was a very generous gesture on their part, and the offer was submitted to and accepted by the Board of Estimate. The area occupied by the orphanage consisted of over 90% of the block in which it was located, and the Park Department, through Commissioner Moses, recommended that the remainder of the block be added to the park. The cost of acquisition of the remainder was some $26,000, making the total cost of acquisition only $118,700. As the total area of the park is 3.38 acres, the cost of acquisition was only $0.80 per square foot, and as Borough President Cashmore so adequately pointed out, that kind of a price could only be secured by intelligent negotiation. And the city had probably the best negotiator in the history of the city when Bob Moses took on this negotiation and got that kind of a price. I take this opportunity to express the city's appreciation to Commissioner Moses for the long years of leadership and direction that he has given to the expansion of our program of park, playground, and beach development. I also take this opportunity to thank Borough President Cashmore for the interest, for the initiative, and for his sponsorship of this particular area to the entire Board of Estimate. During the five and one half years that I've sat as a member of the Board of Estimate with Borough President Cashmore, I'm pleased to tell the people of Brooklyn that their most ardent pleader for things that benefit the borough of Brooklyn, the gentleman that you just heard, Borough President John Cashmore. May the people of this area use of and enjoy these new recreational facilities that are being provided for them. It is only through constructive community projects of this type that we can effectively educate our young children and combat juvenile delinquency and the other social ills which are the concern of each and every one of us. Before closing, I would like to make an announcement that doesn't particularly relate to the borough of Brooklyn, but it is of interest to all the people throughout the entire city of New York, and particularly to the people of Borough of the borough of Queens. Less than two short weeks ago, there was a very able and a distinguished public servant holding the same job that John Cashmore holds here in Brooklyn, in the largest growing community in the entire city of New York, the borough of Queens, a gentleman by the name of Maurice Fitzgerald, who was the borough president of Queens County. Less than two short weeks ago, borough president Fitzgerald appeared to be in excellent health, wonderful spirits. Today, he's gone to his eternal reward. So I wish to take this opportunity to announce that a playground now under construction at Atlantic Avenue and 106th Street in the borough of Queens, for which the late Maurice Fitzgerald, president of the borough of Queens, was almost solely instrumental in obtaining for his immediate neighborhood in Queens, will be officially named the Maurice Fitzgerald playground just as soon as local legislation can be enacted, and the park department will make arrangements for a memorial bronze plaque to be erected at a suitable location in the playground. May the children in this neighborhood enjoy this playground, use it to its fullest extent, and I know if they do that, that there's no question in my mind at all, that right in this audience today, you have a young boy or a young girl that someday might wear the shoes of Bob Moses, might wear the shoes of John Cashmore, or someday might wear the shoes of the present mayor of the city of New York. Thank you. The benediction will be pronounced by Father William McCarran, the Church of Our Lady of Victory. Your Lord, rise, please. May I say before we give the blessing, there is one that God always answers their prayers. That is the children. And so we'd ask the children today to especially pray that this playground will be what those who built it wanted it to be, and that God will also bless them and express as only he can what they have done for our community and for you. So we ask the children especially to join us in prayer. Let us pray. O blessed Lord and Redeemer, bless these grounds that thou hast made with thy hands, that they may become a beneficial and healthful thing for our community. And grant that through the invocation of thy holy name, that all those who use its facilities, are any way connected with its building or its use, may be strengthened in mind and body, that in the years to come, may serve God and their country with all their hearts and with all their mind. Amen. God bless us all. This concludes the ceremonies. The Honorable Robert E. Moses, who is Park Commissioner and Coordinator for the City of All Construction Work, and who has made one of the greatest records in history for this type of contribution to the civic scene, presided as chairman here today at Atlantic Avenue, Kingston Avenue and St. Andrew's Place, and the inauguration ceremonies in connection with the playground itself, St. Andrew's Playground, was personally presided over by the Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable Vincent R. Impelletere, in the presence of our President John Cashmore of Brooklyn, and the distinguished citizens who cooperated in full in all the various aspects of this city in bringing about this wonderful improvement on the scene of the old Brooklyn Orphan Asylum. The Mayor is having a wonderful time here with the neighbors. They're all rushing up to shake hands. The Honorable Vincent Carney, former Commissioner of the Department of Water, Supply, Gas and Electricity, and Mrs. Catherine Smith were the honored guests here today, this being an old neighborhood and a beloved district of theirs. And it's been a great gathering of the neighbors here for the investigation and inspection of this great and wonderful playground. Other perspective, that plays in the private district.
