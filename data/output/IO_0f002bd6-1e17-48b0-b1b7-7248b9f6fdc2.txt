And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Bore, accompanist, in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their kids and their kids, down a lock on the door, pray somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? I've got no luck on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the drugs from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that are tied, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my song, my head is a-whole-day-long. Do you complain it? Not my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no sun, got no moon, and the people see. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty. I've got no prayer all the day. Keep the plenty, you don't have to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am the bread of hell, in a time to rise. Never want me long as I'm well, never want me strive to be gone, to be dead, what the hell, why are you glad I'm alive? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, for heaven's all day long. Now you complain it. I've got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing I've Got Plenty of Nothing from Gershwin's Forgy and Beth. The choristers are under the direction of Florence Martirosian, with Isabelle L'Bori as piano accompanist. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
