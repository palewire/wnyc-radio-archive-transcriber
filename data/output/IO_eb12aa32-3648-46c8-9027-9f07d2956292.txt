Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. New Yorkers have come to City Hall Park this evening to watch one of the town's Christmas time traditions, the lighting of the city Christmas trees. During this program, taking place on the steps of City Hall, you'll hear Mayor F.H. Lagardia's annual Christmas message to his fellow citizens. And after the mayor's address, his son Eric is scheduled to press the switch that will light the 22 Christmas trees in the parks in all the five boroughs, including the 40-foot tree in front of City Hall. And now we take you to the front of the City Hall steps where we hear a musical program by the New York City Police Department, Glee Club. Theanyor of the City Hall The bald head as I understand Is the bravest king in all the land When the street deck with the gate of land And also be responsible The bald head as I understand The bald head as I understand The bald head as I understand As the Lord hath provided this In honor of the King of least That on this day it will be silent CHOIR SINGS Now, ladies and gentlemen, we hear from Mr. William R. H. Latham, park engineer of the Department of Parks, who is representing Commissioner Moses. Annually, the park department takes pleasure in giving the city 22 Christmas trees in different parks throughout the city. In each of the five boroughs, there is a ceremony such as this, going on right now. In each of the other four boroughs, the borough president is the principal speaker of the ceremony. Here in Manhattan, we have two principal speakers. The first, I take pleasure in introducing Borough President Stanley Isaacs. Mr. Latham, fellow citizens, I am proud of the chance to participate in this dignified ceremony dedicating the Christmas tree in City Hall Park, which will stand here as an emblem of beauty and of peace and goodwill. There are some who seem to think that we should not cut down our trees for these purposes, and they are so wrong. Our trees grow in the forests, and they're used for many purposes. Some were cut down to form the lofty masts of ships in the older days. Some are cut down to furnish timber for our houses. Some have the most humble purpose of being turned into pulp that makes paper to carry the spoken and the written word. But what loftier purpose can be served by this beautiful tree that stands here than to stand forth in City Hall Park as the emblem of our real civilization, as that emblem of peace and goodwill that we need to show to the peoples of this city that we are a peaceful nation, that our citizens from all lands are here living peacefully together, and that we breathe to the people of all the world peace and goodwill. Thank you, Mr. Isaacs. I now take pleasure in presenting the mayor, who will give his Christmas message to the people. In keeping the beautiful custom established by the Department of Parks, the mayor joins in extending to the people of the City of New York his personal wishes for a merry Christmas. It is quite proper that approaching the day of Christmas, we pause from our labors for just a few moments and give thought to the significance of Christmas, the day we will be observing on the few days. Christmas has a real significance to people of all creeds. It signifies the mission of the Son of God on Earth, a mission of brotherly love, a mission of justice, of happiness, and of peace among all people. We are fortunate in this country that we have been better able during the last few years to give meaning to this lesson. We have been fortunate in being able to enjoy the blessing of peace. but we cannot be fully and completely happy if there are others in the world who are suffering because of war. We want to share the happiness of peace with all the people of the world. and let our Christmas prayers be dedicated to him in the highest for world's peace. To the people of the city of New York, may you enjoy your Christmas holidays. May that enjoyment be in the midst of your own families. and let us announce to the entire world that we shall glorify him in the highest and pray for peace toward men of goodwill. A merry Christmas to you all. I think we can all add amen to that. The tree will now be lighted by Gene Lugardia who will throw the large switch. ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to the ceremony of the lighting of the Christmas trees being held on City Hall steps. They're just throwing the switch which is in the center of a huge Christmas wreath in front of the steps. The mayor just finished speaking and just then the lights in this 40-foot tree with a beautiful star on top of it overlooking the City Hall Park were just lighted. At the same time, there are 22 trees in all covering the five boroughs of the city all lit up at once as that switch was pressed. In Borough Hall in Brooklyn, Joyce Kilmer Park Bronx, Kings, and the Borough Hall in Richmond Park. The mayor just posed in front of the wreath and in front of the switch with his little daughter after the pressing of the switch. And now I believe we're to listen to the Sacred Heart Boys Choir. The Lord Amid the snows Upon the winter night We'll form the child The Christmas rose The king of love and light And righteous and the shabbat And the grace of every child And the grace of all His blessed world Has passed The exultation O come, let us adore him O come, let us adore him O come, let us adore him Cross the Lord Again the heart with rapture gloves To greet the holy night That gave the world its Christmas rose Its king of love and life Every voice of playing his name The bright, the madres' love From paradise who I became That we with him adore Oh, come let us adore him Oh, come let us adore him Oh, come let us adore him Christ the Lord Oh, come let us adore him Oh, come let us adore him Christ the Lord Oh, come let us adore him Let us adore him Christ the Lord Oh, come let us adore him God, come let us adore him The first of all, the angel is high, From the people's shelter in fields as they lay, In fields where they lay, walking in their sheep, For the world will come high, with so-so need. Lo-well, lo-well, lo-well, lo-well, Who is the King of Israel? Lo-well, lo-well, lo-well, lo-well. Who is the King of Israel? The League Club will now present O Holy Night. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? It is the night of the dear Savior's birth. Long lay the world in sin and error pining Till he appeared and the soul felt his words. A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices For young the praise a new and glorious Lord. All on your knees O hear the angels' voices O God divine O God When Christ was born O night divine O night O night divine O night divine O night divine O night divine O night divine Learned by the light O night rolling O led by light, O the stars sweetly gleaming, Here came the wise men from the Aryan land. The King of kings, they thus in lowly manger, In all our trials, born to be our friend. O I am here, O hear the angel voices, O night divine, O night when Christ was born. O night divine, O night, O night divine. O night divine, O night divine. O night divine, O night divine, O night divine. O night divine, O night divine. O day divine, O night divine.
