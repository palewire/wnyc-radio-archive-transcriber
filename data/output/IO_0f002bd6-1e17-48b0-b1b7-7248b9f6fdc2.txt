A spiritual is just sung by the choristers. And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabelle de Bore, accompanist, in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. O, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no cause, got no muse, got no misery. The Folk should get me up and down, a lock on the door. Bring somebody to go and run, but without a make in more. What for? What for? I got a lock on the door, that's the way to be. Take and steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that are tied, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's ready for me. I got my gals, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gals, got my lor, got my song. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I can't go sun, can't the moon, can't the people see. The folks with plenty of money, got to pray all the day. Keep the plenty, don't worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, when it's time to rise. Never worry long and not well, never want to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell, why you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got my gals, got my gals, for heaven's whole day long. Do you complain it? I got my gals, got my gals, got my lor, got my lor. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Betts. The choristers are under the direction of Florence Martirosian, with Isabelle Laboree as piano accompanist. Before the Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
