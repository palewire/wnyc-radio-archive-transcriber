Today is Bronx Day at New York's International Airport at Idlewild. The borough president of the Bronx, a distinguished company, have come here to pay their tribute from one great borough to another. We all realize that space is a requirement, and out here in the borough of Queens, that space, one of the greatest spaces in the world, has been developed in the development itself of the New York International Airport at Idlewild. Ever since the inauguration of this field last Saturday, as well as the programs that have gone forth to entertain the huge audiences that have come here, and whose words and descriptions have been carried by the public address system of your own city station, WNYC AM and FM, we're happy indeed that these communication facilities are available to carry the important messages of the borough presidents and the other members of the Board of Estimate City Council, and those who are concerned with the good and welfare and the development of our great and wonder city. New York's International Airport at Idlewild increases to a great extent the commerce and industry of our great city, and will be in a short time the greatest airport in the world. We have the privilege now of presenting a distinguished citizen of New York City from the great borough of the Bronx, when we present at this time, Borough President Lyons, who will introduce his guest. Borough President Lyons. Mr. Chairman, the Bronx flag will be raised by the Secretary of the Borough, John Murray. The Glee Club of the Fire Department will open our ceremonies with the national anthem. The Glee Club of the Fire Department will open our ceremonies with the national anthem. At the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, Through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched, Were so gallantly streaming, And the rocket's red glare, The bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night, That our flag was still there, O'er the land of the free, That star-spangled banner yet wave, O'er the land of the free, And the home of the brave. Thank you very much. The chairman of the Bronx Anniversary Committee, Congressman Walter A. Lynch, Has been called to Washington for the special session, And I shall therefore preside at these ceremonies. The Bronx is pleased to participate in the golden anniversary of the city of New York, And to salute the air capital of the world. I think the city of New York and its people, O'er the great debt of gratitude to Grover Whalen, For the magnificent way he has planned and guided this international air exposition, As well as all the other events and functions, In connection with the golden anniversary celebration. Some may have observed that I, As president of the Bronx, Came out here today, In the same official open car, With city flags, Which brought President Truman to this stand last Saturday. I am informed that the president of Queens, And the acting president of Manhattan, Traveled here within the last few days, With the same pomp. I think that if Grover Whalen, Were to be sent to Moscow, He could undoubtedly smooth out Some of the ruffle situations existing there. The Bronx very proudly boasts Of some of its distinctive features from the other boroughs. It is the only borough on the mainland. It is the only borough to which definite article is prefixed. This is not a mere coincidence, But because it is the greatest borough, In the greatest city, In the greatest country in the world. It is the home of the fall of fame, And a perfect locale, In which to pay homage to men and women, Who have made notable contributions to humanity. It is the home of the Yankees, Who have won more pennants in World Series, Than any other city. It is the first meeting place of the Security Council, Of the United Nations, Where Gromyko took his first walkout. Dame rumor has it, That some Queensies, Have also taken walkouts, Very recently. The Bronx Zoo, And the Bronx Botanical Gardens, Surpass all others. The Bronx, Is the greatest melting pot, Comprising peoples of varied racial, And religious strains. It is in the Bronx, Where tolerance is a reality, And not just a vaunted hope. It is the borough of universities, Where more people receive degrees, Of higher education, Than any place of its size, In the world. Notwithstanding these, And many other features, That I might cite, Were it not for modesty, I must frankly admit, That the vision and foresight, Of our early planners, And public officials, Could not foretell, The progress in air travel, Particularly during a period, In which they were engaged, In changing from horse cars, And stagecoaches, To trolley cars. Instead, They provided the Bronx, With such a tremendous area, Of parks and playgrounds, That one fifth of our entire borough, Is devoted to recreation facilities, Leaving no large, Undeveloped land, Suitable for modern airports. The only Bronx site, Suitable for an airport, Was one known as, Curtis Airport, In the North Bronx. At my request, This was considered, For a city or airport, By the previous administration, Prior to construction, Of LaGuardia Field. I understand, That this site, Has now been privately acquired, For a racetrack. This leaves the Bronx, With no suitable area, For airport purposes, Unless, And until, Science, In air travel, Developed for use, Of smaller landing fields. It was therefore, Quite proper, That the city of New York, Should have gone out, To the wide open spaces, Of Queens, And selected this site, For its great, New York, International airport. I join, With our sister boroughs, In congratulating, Borough President Burke, And the people of Queens, Upon the vastness, Of the borough. I can only offer, The borough of Queens, No greater wish, Than that it will always be, As important to aviation, As the Bronx is, To education, And culture. Now my pleasure, To introduce, 50 years, Of the Bronx, In song and story, By the Bronx boomers. All have heard, The Bronx bombers, But today, We are going to hear, From the Bronx boomers. The cavalcade, Of the Bronx. Ladies and gentlemen, In the next few minutes, We will telescope, 50 years of history. The story of an era, That began in 1898, And continues up to, And including, This very day. As a famous, New Yorker said, Let's look at the record, And a proud record it is. For no people, In the city of New York, Have more pride, In their community, Than have the citizens, Of that delightful land, Just the other side, Of the Harlem River, The borough of the Bronx. First, A musical salute, By the Bronx boomers, Four young men, Of that happy county. When you come over, To that land of clover, The Bronx always welcomes you, Go out to the concourse, And visit the zoo, Fordham, Manhattan, And old NYU, No use denying, Jim Lyons is trying, To do everything for you, So when you come over, To that land of clover, The Bronx will sure welcome you, Let's go back 50 years, To 1898. That's when the city of greater New York was formed, Centered around Manhattan, And reaching out to Pelham Bay on the north, The Atlantic Ocean on the south, Deep into Long Island on the east. In those days, A half century ago, The Bronx was known as the borough of farms and breweries. There were miles of open country, Between the various communities that made up the borough, West Farms and Kingsbridge, Morrisania and Throgs Neck, Fordham and Mott Haven, West Farms and Williamsbridge, Young gallants promenaded on Willis Avenue with their ladies, Peg-top trousers and billowing bustles, Were the order of the day. Off in Cuba, The war crowds rumbled and thundered. Off we go, For to fight the war with Spain, You can bet, That we won't forget the main, On Willis Avenue, They'll be cheering you and me, Cause there's a hot tie, In the old Bronx tonight, So long folks, There's a tear in every eye, So long girls, For it's time to say goodbye, And we say so long, Pals, We'll be with you by and by, And there'll be a hot time, In the old Bronx that night. The troops returned. There were triumphal parades and homecomings, And everybody settled down to enjoy life. Ah, in 1898 to 1908, That was a golden decade in America. Bicycles filled the highways, And the first automobiles huffed and puffed their way about. Butter was 25 cents a pound. There were lots of vacant apartments, Flats we called them, And a man couldn't carry home a dollar's worth of groceries. Life was simple, easy, and inexpensive. The good old days of 1908. Don't mind my raven, Got a gal in Mauthaven, She's classy, And she's refined. And others in West Palm, She sure has the best job, And I can't make up my mind. I've got a cutie, A real King's Bridge beauty, I think that my bride she'll be. So you can keep your Long Island, The Bronx, it is my land, It's the home of the Queens to me. The next decade was rich in memories for Bronxites, 1908 to 1918. It was then that New Yorkers first realized The magnificent facilities of the Bronx for outdoor sports. Athletic fields and clubs like the Melrose A.C. Sprouted all over the borough. The building and extension of subways Brought millions to Bronx Park And other open areas Destined to be the lungs of congested Manhattan. In 1917, war came to our shores, And the Bronx gave generously of her sons. They served in the regular army, The 27th Division, The 77th Division, With the Navy and the Marines And our Infant Air Corps. Pelham Bay Park was turned into a gigantic training center For the United States Navy. The Bronx bought heavily of Liberty bonds And gave till it hurt to the Red Cross. Some of the men who came back Brought with them their scars and their wounds. Let us not forget them, The veterans who are with us In Kingsbridge Hospital. And for them we ask, The Bronx boomers to sing, Roses are blooming in Picardy. Roses are blooming in Picardy In the harsh of the silver dew Roses are blooming in Picardy But then there was a rose like you And the roses will die with the summertime And our rose may be far, far apart But there's one rose that dies now In Picardy Tis the rose that I keep in high With the end of the war And the return to peace in 1919, The borough of the Bronx faced a serious situation. There was unemployment, High prices, Lack of housing, So many of the same problems that plague us this very day. But the people of the Bronx were not content to sit around And mourn the good old days. They set to work with a will. The borough saw its greatest building boom up to that time. Whole blocks of homes sprung up overnight Where cows had grazed contentedly only a few short weeks before. Attractive land across the river from the polo grounds Became the gigantic Yankee Stadium. Home of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, And their world champion Yankees baseball teams. It was a time of boom and bust. Hoopla and hooray, Million dollar prize fights and startling murder trials. The speakeasy flourished and everybody danced The Charleston and the Black Bottom. Remember three o'clock in the morning? Three o'clock in the morning, Back to the Bronx we go On the loco to Woodland Been to a Broadway show Three o'clock in the morning She bought the music was fine Got to get up and be in the office Tomorrow at night It all came to an end on that Black Thursday in 1929 When the stock market crashed. The Bronx started its fourth decade As a borough with unemployment, Depression, Empty stores and silent factories. The song of the day was Brother, can you spare a dime? And they weren't kidding. Then along came the Blue Eagle, The WPA and recovery. Things began to look brighter. In 1934, a new administration came in And brought with it a new borough president, Young and energetic Jimmy Lyons, Who promptly christened our community The Borough of Universities. New industries came in, New people, new building, A new spirit, And we all sang Throw out the barrel We'll have a barrel of fun Throw out the barrel We've got the blues on the run Sing, boom, farewell Bring out a song of good cheer Cause now's the time To roll the barrels For the gangs of here That was in 1938 And now we come to the fifth And final decade Of our half century of progress. Nobody here needs to be reminded Of the contribution of the Bronx And its people To the victory in Europe And in the Pacific. Nobody here has to be told That the Bronx needs more homes, More apartments, More commercial buildings, More institutions. And everybody here knows That butter at a dollar a pound And meat at a dollar ten a pound All add up to the highest cost of living In our history. Yet we pause in our problems To celebrate the golden anniversary Of greater New York. For as loyal citizens of the Bronx, We are proud of our city And proudest of our borough. We may not have magnificent airports Like Queens Or skyscrapers like Manhattan Or ocean beaches like Brooklyn Or wooded hills like Staten Island. But we do have uncounted thousands Of happy people In their own homes. And that is the bedrock of America. Next question, Where do we go from here? Where do we go from here, folks? Where do we go from here? The population of the Bronx Increases year by year But there is room for everyone So don't you have a fear? So where do we go from here, folks? Where do we go from here? They talk about a war again And we don't like the signs The enemy has airplanes And factories and mines But they can't do a thing Without a permit from Jim Lyons So where do we go from here, folks? Where do we go from here? The Bronx boomers Who have entertained you This afternoon with song Desire to give you one Farewell verse Of their four-leaf clover special. When you come over That land of clover The Bronx always welcomes you Just cross the river The borough begins You're in the home Of the covens and twins No use denying Jim Lyons is trying To do everything for you So when you come over To that land of clover The Bronx will sure welcome you The Bronx marches forward The 50 years of progress In the Bronx Would not have been possible Were not for the cooperation Of its splendid civic organization We have as the head Of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce An outstanding citizen Who was chosen As Bronx number one citizen Who directs the affairs Of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce I'm going to call on Mr. George Ufman To say a few words For President Lyons Postmaster Goldman Ladies and gentlemen The Bronx is proud To be able to acclaim The opening of this Great international airport In conjunction With the celebration Of the Golden Jubilee Of Greater New York We highly compliment Honorable Grover A.
