This is David Randolph speaking to you by transcription. In this age of enlightenment, when we have so much culture all around us, I think the discriminating music lover shows his sophistication as much by the music he doesn't listen to as by the music he likes to hear. Did you know that in order to help you to listen selectively, Station WNYC publishes a booklet that lists practically all the music that's going to play for the next two months? That gives you a two-way check on what to avoid. Let me explain that. First, if you're free on any particular date, you simply consult this booklet under that date, and there you'll find the exact hour at which every composition is going to be played. That means you know just what you can avoid on that day and when. Or, just for the sake of argument, let's say that you don't like Beethoven's Symphony No. 8. Well, there's an alphabetical index at the back of this booklet. You look up Beethoven and under that the Symphony No. 8. And you find that it's going to be played twice on August 26th, at nine in the morning and again at seven in the evening. And that way you can be forewarned. You therefore leave a note for yourself saying, be sure not to listen twice on August 26th. And then there's no danger of tuning in Beethoven's Eighth Symphony by accident. You see what an efficient method this is. After all, there's no point in not listening to a piece of music if it's not being broadcast. But with this booklet, you have the satisfaction of knowing precisely when your unfavorite piece of music will be played, and then you can make a point of avoiding it. I think it's the only civilized way and the only modern way of listening to music on the radio. The cost of this booklet is only 20 cents in stamps for a full year. You might look upon it as a form of insurance against the music you don't want to hear. And 20 cents is a very inexpensive premium to pay for a whole year. So may I suggest that you write now to WNYC for the Masterwork Bulletin. You might send your request to me, David Randolph, and I'll see that it gets to the right place. The address is WNYC, New York 7. And I think you'll be glad you did it when you think of the time you'll save in the long run. This is David Randolph speaking to you by transcription.
