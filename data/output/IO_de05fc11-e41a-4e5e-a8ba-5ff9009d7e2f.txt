Starlight, star bright. Gee, I wish we had a place to go tonight. Gosh, I'm sorry, kid. We fellas at camp haven't any place to go. Haven't anything to do when we're off duty. You see, the town's only got 2,000 population. There are about 50,000 of us. Well, I think someone should do something about it. You're right, young lady, and somebody is doing something about it. To meet this great defense problem, the six leading organizations that helped the soldiers and sailors in the last war have combined to form the United Service Organization to be known as USO. And today, USO is raising approximately $11 million to staff and maintain over 360 off-duty service clubs for our soldiers and sailors. But USO needs your help and the generous help of every American who believes in America. Give today to USO. Send your contributions to your local committee or to USO, 350 Fifth Avenue, New York City.

You're right, soldier. The army is doing all it can and doing it well. But there's another army behind the army. The USO, the United Service Organization. And these six leading organizations that helped the soldiers and sailors in the last war know that into towns of 1,000 to 5,000 population may come as many as 2,000 men on a single evening.

Oh, we found plenty to do in the cities near the camps. But the camps today aren't near the big cities. Don't worry, Mother. Jimmy can take care of himself. Well, I can't help thinking about it.
