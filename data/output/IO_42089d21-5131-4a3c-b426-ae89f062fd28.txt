We will open with the National Anthem. We will open with the National Anthem. We will open with the National Anthem. We will open with the National Anthem by the Reverend Francis McElhenney, Pastor of St. John Corsestin. Honorable Acting Commissioner and Acting President of the City Council, Honorable Mr. Sharkey, fellow clergymen, distinguished speakers, and members of the Fire Department Band whose music we've been enjoying so much. Ladies and gentlemen, on this happy occasion, the laying of the cornerstone for this Hunts Point pollution control project, I feel that every one of us wants to convey our congratulations to the hardworking committee whose foresight and vision and energy and knowledge has made possible the laying of the cornerstone here today in this Hunts Point section of the bronze. Thank you. Thank you. While we admire all that is being done here, and we'll probably receive a liberal education from other speakers as to what all this sewage control really means, we must not forget that in days like this a huge project of this kind needs supernatural guidance as well as the best of our natural intentions and work and so I know that you expect me to invoke the blessing of Almighty God not only upon this plan here but the 16 others that are to be completed at a cost of $327 million in the course of approximately the next five years it was an immense project and many things could happen between now and then so I turn to Almighty God in a crisis of this kind and ask thee, O God, to hear our prayers today for the success of this project to bless the efforts of the good men who are in charge of it and who are so conscientiously and so well discharging their tasks we ask you also to bear with us sometimes with our indifference because at times and distractions of life we're liable to forget the importance of God Almighty even though this month of November when there's an icy coldness in the very air that we breathe remind us that our own death may not be far away and we have a duty to pray for our dead the souls in purgatory we're also reminded of our carelessness perhaps we have not thought of God as much as we should in our national affairs times we notice a tendency to sort of shove him out of this universe that he has created as though it belonged to somebody else instead of him and so we know that this nation that will not serve God will perish and that unless the Lord watch over the city they labor in vain who guide it or watch over it we must have his help and so dear God we ask forgiveness for our mistakes in the past for our lack of confidence in your cooperation and intercession and we ask that this grand work may go on now to a very happy fulfillment that there'll be no labor strikes of a serious nature that there'll be no plagues in the neighborhood there'll be no long depression or no third world war to torment us we ask you almighty God to hear our prayer for our nation and our country and for these grand works that are being done for our benefit the facilities that this great plant will give us in health and in educational and also in recreational advantages dear almighty God help us and especially please this project that it may not fail it may be carried on to success so I turn put a blessing now upon this cornerstone that God's approval may rest always with it in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost Amen may the blessing of almighty God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost descend upon this cornerstone and remain with it forever in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost Amen thank you Father thank you thank you Commissioner Fredericks of Maryland Commissioner of Public Works who has to preside today came up here a few days ago to make sure that everything was alright and managed to catch a cold I'm hoping that that doesn't happen to the rest of us today so that the doctor has ordered him to stay in it's my privilege under the circumstances to preside and it's a happy occasion for the Department of Public Works this plant is part of our pollution control program and it's an important adjunct the completion of this plant which is and it'll probably be put into operation early next spring means that the waters of the upper Harlem upper Bronx Ace River and the lower bay or lower Sound will be practically free of pollution insofar as any pollution from sewage from the city of New York is concerned it's going to permit a cleanup of the adjacent waters and permit the park department to advance its plans for the development of bathing beaches at the Ferry Point Park in the Bronx and at the Clearwater Park in Queen this before I call upon our distinguished speakers this project of course is not the work of one individual or of one contractor the actual conception of this sewage pollution program is in the hands of the engineers of the Department of Public Works headed by the director of that division Mr. Richard Gould who is a leading authority and recognized I believe throughout the world as an authority on sewage treatment and pollution control Mr. Gould will you take a bow? I think the credit for the development of this entire city program insofar as the technical details go should be given to Mr. Gould and his staff the actual development of the plans that is the drafting work and some of the development work was in the hands of Greeley and Hansen the firm of engineers the I can't name all the contractors the prime contractor on this job is J. Rich Steers and I believe Mr. Steers is with us Mr. Steers is sitting here and he is responsible for the biggest contract other contractors Poir McLean I believe they're represented Tully and DiNapoli Driscoll and others now it's my pleasure at this time to call upon the Honorable Mr. Sheridan Commissioner Borough Works of the Bronx to speak to you representing Borough President Glyons Commissioner Arthur V. Sheridan Commissioner Borough Works Mr. Chairman Mr. Acting Mayor Commissioners too numerous to mention ladies and gentlemen may I at the outset present the regrets of the President of the Borough who was suddenly and unavoidably detained causing me to be authorized to come here on about five minutes notice today is the culmination of hope that has been in the hearts of the citizens of the Bronx for at least thirty years to my knowledge there have been many changes and many different sometimes conflicting ideas concerning how the natural waterfront of this borough could be saved for posterity possessed on three sides by splendid facilities it had become badly polluted with the result that bathing had been more or less prohibited at many of its beach facility locations recently the Commissioner of Parks has succeeded in reclaiming one beach and is about to reclaim another subject of course to the accomplishment of this particular project it is perhaps not out of order to express regret at the illness of Commissioner Zemeilin for the particular reason that he was born in the Bronx and perhaps that had something to do with finally bringing to fruition the hopes and aspirations of the people of this borough it is also significant and I hope not out of water to note that several of the engineers including the project engineer are Bronx citizens and they too are entitled to the thanks of the people of this community one could not however pass the occasion without noting the fact that the help that has finally come required the support of the Board of Estimate the financial backing which has long been lacking for these projects was more or less forced on us by the Interstate Sanitation Commission and the Board of Estimate and its representative here today the President of the Council Joe Sharkey have in recent years lent an exceeding sympathetic ear to the needs of this borough and I think that you will all agree that more progress has been made in the last few years than in the previous generation in closing one can only say that he hopes that all the intention purposes of this magnificent improvement for it is magnificent despite the fact that it does not have the publicity and perhaps the glory that is sometimes attached to other types of work Sanitation is next to water supply perhaps the most necessary of all public improvements for an urban community but it lies much of it underground and seldom receives the recognition that should accrue to it it is a difficult engineering project requires a great deal of highly specialized knowledge and the people of the Bronx I'm sure will be doubly grateful to the Board of Estimate to the Department of Public Works to the contractors and to the engineers who have finally brought this project to fruition thank you I might mention that the present chairman also resides in the Bronx but he doesn't benefit he's over on the other side of the Bronx it would be rather foolish to attempt to introduce the next speaker he's so well known but I believe it is only necessary to say that we will now hear from the Honorable Robert Moses chairman shockey ladies and gentlemen I'm glad that Arthur Sheridan spoke of the unsung heroes of the engineering profession who work on these somewhat undramatic or unmelodramatic projects like this one which are forgotten because there's so many other things that have so much more appeal to the emotions and generally are not nearly as important this is a basic thing as Arthur has said I don't know whether it comes before or after water supply but they go together anyone who's worked on problems of municipalities here and elsewhere knows that those are the first things that you look at and if you don't find them you don't find any civilization to analyze some of these countries that we're trying to help abroad you find out that it's the lack of sanitation the lack of water that makes them backward countries I want to say just emphasize just one thing we're at the end of a campaign which if I may say so without any disrespect to any of the contestants including my friend Joe Sharkey has not been distinguished for its emphasis on constructive matters I don't see anything that this administration or the previous one has to apologize for when it comes to public improvements I know that it makes a popular appeal to put on a television show radio performance circus has more appeal than it has to talk about a sewer program but this administration and the previous one in this field inherited a god awful mess I was in the previous administration I guess the only full commissioner who survived the 12 years I don't know now how that happened but so it was in any event the O'Dwyer administration when it came in face to face with a problem which is if you read your circular you'll see in the end it's going to cost over 300 million dollars to solve there wasn't much done about it in previous administrations my mind goes back to when I was a boy and began this kind of work in the Mitchell administration the Mitchell administration made reports on everything under the sun but did nothing about any of them now when you think of the pollution of our waterfront destruction of natural values destruction of residential values destruction of recreation we were in desperate shape when this program got underway and it's well underway now it means that we're going to reclaim our waterfront means that after the first stage is finished a large part of the reclamation will have been carried out including the two parts that have been referred to the one here in the Bronx ferry point which will relieve the pressure on Pelham Bay on Pelham Bay and Orchard Beach and one across the way in Queens and out of the byproducts of this and other plants come the material to make topsoil which we couldn't get in any other way I think it's a swell job nothing to apologize for I might refer in passing to the fact that within the last year we've had a number of visiting firemen from many other countries who've been looking over our improvements and among them quite a few people from Brazil and in particular from the city of Sao Paulo which is I suppose the fastest growing city in the world they have a terrible problem involving the treatment of sewage these engineers who've come up here including the new mayor recently elected governor all the top engineers have been amazed at the progress that's been made in this city in dealing with the sewage problem same thing applies to the garbage problem which is also left to recent administrations garbage was just dumped most of it on private land the benefit no doubt of the private landowner but it didn't do the people of the city much good now we're building plants and in the interval while the plants are being built we're reclaiming and filling land for parks same thing applies to many other fields of public improvements there's a lot been done here you wouldn't think so if you read the papers during the election this city hasn't so much to apologize for and I wish that from now on there were more emphasis put on things of this kind and less on criticism mud throwing fouling our own nest because this is quite a good town I want to congratulate those who were responsible for the improvement Commissioner Zermulin they don't say much about people like that in the course of these mud slingings as a first class public servant there are lots of them in the city of New York there's only a minority of people that we have any occasion to be ashamed of I want to congratulate the engineers and consulting engineers and the contractors and last but not least the men who did this job thank you thank you Mr. Morris I'm going to ask before introducing the next speaker that the Reverend Jacob Wagner who is President of the Bronx Division of the Protestant Council of New York to deliver a prayer this time let us pray Almighty God our eternal Father in whom we live and move and have our being we thank thee for our city we bless thee for homes that are substantial churches that are vital and citizens who put public service above personal and petty selfishness we pray thee oh God bless this project designed to improve our city provide for healthful and sanitary conditions and we thank thee that thou hast given wisdom and strength to men who create it we pray thee oh Lord thy forgiveness upon us for the unmet needs of the multitudes of people in our city and ask that there may rise up in our city a community of good will of tolerance of service and faith which will make our city more nearly the city of God amen thank you thank you it's now my pleasure to introduce to you the honorable Joseph T. Sharkey president of the city council and I hope that keeping him out here in the breezes of Hunts Point has not harmed that throat any the honorable Joe Sharkey thank you commissioner reverend Claygie commissioner moses distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen new york is the finest and cleanest big city in the world morally and physically it's been my pleasure to come here today just a week ago I was at the opening of the rockaway beach plant and shortly we'll I hope open the owl's head plant in Brooklyn we're doing something about pollution in this city both of our waters and our air we have an air pollution program which we hope will eventually clean this town and while we don't ever expect to make it as clean as a Kansas farm town if we get a 75% improvement it'll be well worthwhile living in and something the people of this city really deserve we do something about our morals too we get after them we don't just let them linger on as they do at other places this is the finest and the cleanest big city in the world we've built a hundred schools since world war two and we're building them at a terrific cost we're getting one school today where we used to get three but thank god for men like Bob Moses and others who sat around a table six years ago and a new administration came into power in the city and debated whether or not to go ahead with our building plans because of the excessive costs at that time thank god for their great and good judgment they decided to go ahead of course today this town would be in utter chaos if we hadn't continued to build even in spite of the prices because they never did come down and continued to spiral upward in all that time I'm proud to be a guest at this very important occasion the opening of the Hunts Point pollution control project is one of the last links in the vast system that is eliminating sewage pollution throughout our city the conception and execution of projects such as this represents long term municipal planning of the highest sort and as a further indication of the many activities of your city's government and its desire to provide a healthy wholesome atmosphere for the inhabitants of this city similar plans that will be constructed in other boroughs of the city it is the aim of this administration that the overall plan will be completed by 1959 recreational facilities will greatly benefit by the cleaning up of the waters in this city reclamation of the vast natural resources in this area the transformation of previously unusable land into modern fully equipped parks bathing beaches boating and fishing facilities are all being made possible through the sewage control project conceived by our administration I think it only fair to point out that these projects show a civic mindedness that is part of the makeup of every person in this administration are only a few of those who have been completed or planned during the past years and that the plans for the future are on an even more ambitious scale this project stands as a tribute to our city and a stinging rebuke to those who would seek to defame it and ladies and gentlemen I'm going to be very brief because if I'm not I'm afraid that some of us will be in the same position that Commissioner Zimulman is in thanks for being with us here today thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you now on behalf of the Department of Public Works its engineers who have planned this plant and have struggled with it and have lived with it who have been here with the contractors on behalf of the individual men who have laid the bricks and the mortar and done all the other work I wish to thank the Honorable Joe Sharkey Commissioner Moses Commissioner Sheridan for coming here and officiating at this ceremony I'm now going to ask Rabbi Abrah Abrams President of the Bronx Council of Rabbis to say the benediction Lord of the universe who favorest men with knowledge and teachest mortals understanding we come unto thee this day with rejoicing to praise and render thanks unto thy holy name for thy loving kindness and truth O receive in mercy and in favor our prayers that thou establish this Hunts Point pollution center for the good of all the peoples who live who live in our wonderful city pour forth thy blessings on the founders builders and administrators of this great project and upon all those who have gathered here to take part in the cornerstone laying ceremony preserve them from every evil preserve their lives may there be realized in them thy gracious promise blessed art thou when thou comest in blessed art thou when thou goest out O spread thy tabernacle of peace over our country and over all the nations of the world and let the pleasantness of the Lord our God be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands for us yea the work of our hands establish thou it amen we kind of reversed things a little bit today we had our counterstone trial ceremony in advance and this concludes the ceremonies therefore and I hope that nobody caught cold and so
