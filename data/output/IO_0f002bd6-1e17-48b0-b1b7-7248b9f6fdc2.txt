Florence Martirosian directs the choristers of the Department of Welfare in two madrigals. We hear first, The Banks of Allen Water, followed by Now is the Month of Maying. The Banks of Allen Water, where the springtime may fall, On the village's lovely daughters, there is some men all, For it's dry, a soldier's summer, and a willing tongue and ear, On the banks of Allen Water, not all day and year. The Banks of Allen Water, where the northern spread is so, There is some men all, and a willing tongue, But she's blinded no more. For the summer, the Greek and water, And the soldier falls not near, On the banks of Allen Water, Not all bad as she. The Banks of Allen Water, where the winter snow fell by, Till the scenes of Miller's door, And the chilling blues of land. From the millers of the old land, Both the cold and careless stream, From the banks of Allen Water, From the banks of Allen Water, And the hill of the lake sea. The Banks of Allen Water, where the winter snow fell, And the snow fell, and a willing tongue, And the snow fell, and a willing tongue.
