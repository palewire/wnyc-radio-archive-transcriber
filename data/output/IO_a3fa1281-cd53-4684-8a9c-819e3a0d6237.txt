The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the fog, I hear the fog, I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, may Goodbye, darling, may Goodbye, darling, I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something yet she A and Baba and I can't casting Something tells me I am near at the front to fight the foe. Give us, soldier boys, a marching, and I can no longer stay. Come, I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing, queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, fall in, it won't be long. We're on our way, hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, through the air. Handsome snakes the heart grow thunder. Ooh. Handsome snakes the heart grow thunder. Ooh. Ooh. That is why I long for you. Longly through the nights I thunder. Wondering, darling, if you're true. Only through the nights I thunder. Wondering, darling, if you're true. Distance only lands and shambles. All the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you. And the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother. Just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over. Yes, she is. Christ, she is. Christ, she is. Christ, she is. Christ, she is. Christ, she is. And the sun gets flowers. Oh, she dies so free. She dies so free. You will see the word you say. That's the time we do shall wear. When the harvest days are over. Just be near. Just be near. My just be near. My just be near. My just be near. My just be near. My just be near. My just be near. The wilderness. Prince, you are. George, into a mountain of the lux–∏ ball. Peavy hold with a strong Nan rub if on. As a bad setup. He lies from the floor. With a carrying out door. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded The poor girl would shake me alone He's there is a girl with a small learning friend And the past day long Sweet Adelaide My Adelaide At night, dear heart For you I find In all my dreams Your fair face be You're the flower of my heart Sweet Adelaide Sweet Adelaide Sweet Adelaide Sweet Adelaide Sweet Adelaide Sweet Adelaide Sweet Adelaide Sweet Adelaide Sweet Adelaide Sweet Adelaide She stands when you think of a weightless life For you shall not make me wait And her beauty was sold For an old man's gold She's a bird in a given day A little brunca, a shady green spot No happier home I find My heart's barely gone I love only one She's the girl I let to be mine Just one girl Only just one girl Where on earth I know that there's not my heart The more age is just one day I'll be happy forever, Christian wonder I'll be happy forever, Christian wonder I'll be happy forever, Christian wonder Okay, all ears differing Here are some figures Not working but me I love only one Now I'll be happy I probably aim to try out I'll be happy ever The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Don't ring it and bell, don't ring it and bell, stay the ringing of the glory of the day. Hear them and bell, hear them and bell, ring it up the glory of the day. The End The End Two little girls in blue, lad Two little girls in blue They were sisters We were brothers And learned to love her too And one little girl in blue, lad Who won your father's home Became your mother I married the other But we have drifted apart She was bred in old Kentucky Where the meadow grass is blue There's the sunshine of the country In her faith and manner too She was bred in old Kentucky Take her boy, you're mighty lucky When you marry a girl like you Come back, come back Ever since we were born Sharing each other's sorrow Sharing each other's joy The grass when man was was morning They blew her dear, I'd be kind When they just read us, my darling Oh, comrade, what's there by my side There's a name that's never spoken And a mother's heart have broken There is just another missing From the old home Where we belong There is still a memory living There's a father unforgiving And a picture that is true Who's alone She's my sweetheart I'm her mom She's my honey My bar toe Good real valley Never before With her honey to me It's my sweetheart One evening in the month of May I met old Satan on the way I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die Go away Go away Go away Go away Go away Go away Go away Who are you Who are you Go away Go away Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Not because your face is fair, love to see. But your soul, so pure and sweet, makes my happiness complete. Makes me fodder at your feet, sweet Marie. Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that style? Isn't it a knobby one and just a proper style? I'd just like to have one just the same as that. Where ever I go, they shout, hello! Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir, but not goodbye. The past is dead. Love cannot die. We're better fall had we not met. I loved you then. I loved you, yes. Baby, baby, give me your answer too. I love, pray thee, for the love of you. It won't be a styling marriage, I can't afford a family. But you don't speak, what must be, I think so dim for two. When you hear the rest of things in me, for joy, love, and praise thee, you must sing. And when the birds stand through, in the forest of the night, If there be a forest of the night, you'll come tonight. When you hear the rest of things in me, for joy, love, and praise thee, you must sing. And when the birds stand through, in the forest of the night, If there be a hot time, we'll come tonight. Free of a f-d, f-d, f-d, f-d. The End
