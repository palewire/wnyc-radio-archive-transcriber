His wohl grows susah and arrows use simply as cookie. and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. in 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scurney of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Thank you. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the Mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it is with profound commotion that I have heard your words affectionate and cordiales revolting to my modest person and to the noble city that I have here from their both in such a way we have been attacking you and every act that an uns worrying is to overcome the number of us depends on what we have among it. But our number of Crofts and have within your meaning we have completed our a visit of cordiality, that is a great place to all of us. She also gave her homage to the mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent to be recognized by the genoese population so connected to the land of America. But she, the Hon. Imperiteri, was also brought to Genova ambassador of democracy. That is so expensive to the United States, but so expensive to the Italians, especially to the Genoese. For this, the Hon. Imperiteri, we are grateful for her because she was a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States and the United States for which every American citizen, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to to have high degrees representative of the city. So, this is not only a response, not only a courtesy, the Hon. Imperiteri, this is not only a courtesy, it is about the city of Cristoforo Colombo and the most great city of the United States and its own State. It is about the name of the United States, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. It is about the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic Italian and has contributed to the United States to make it a great salute of this man and the Italian population to the great people of the United States, to the United States, which we are deeply grateful because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to give us to give us libertarian democratic when we have intervened so potent in the war and to protect them today with many material sacrifices and of men and of men so that today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of the democracy and have operated intelligently to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in all the world. Well, Hon. Imperiteri, Hon. Sindaco di New York it is with this faith that we work because democratic democratic freedom are really in the world and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy our task for sometimes we are not understanding we are not understanding we are we must remember that the reconstruction of the democracy in Italy is happened in the moment our task in how we Launch in which we have played East там space we did not want to dive into Ford but we care we were involved in Dice with the and materialmente, our country. It is with these sentiments, honorable imperiteration, that I salute you and the city of New York and say that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of our country's democracy. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in searching your own land is an example to all the genoveses. The tenacious, not credulous, contrasted by every man, and by the events of the people, this man knew that this great land exists and looked at it desperately. He went to the river, and looked at the river, and looked at the estuary, and looked at the passage that he wanted to find to join the world under the cross of the Christian. and suppose, one at the end, not as a state of the long結el — who should I hold as a passage to each other — and my homeland also will find peace and work. And近ed toすごい Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts indeed which have a significance in themselves and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps it didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
