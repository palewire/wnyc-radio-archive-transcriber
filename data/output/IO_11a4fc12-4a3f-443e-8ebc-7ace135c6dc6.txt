Who see that nature's plentifulness is a heritage not to be squandered with impunity, that it must be conserved for future generations, or its bankruptcy will extinguish us all. You are that handful of practical men and women in a world of ambitious dreamers who see what new horizons of abundance and respite from toil is possible for men if they but use the intelligence and diligence and resourcefulness of which man is capable. No one can say that your work is made easy for you. In few places are you the honored prophets. There are few places in the world today where your counsel and your warning have not cut athwart some passion or prejudice, some sloth or fear. In such irrational atmosphere, the conservationist has had to work in obscurity and has had to develop special attributes of tenacity and patience to save men from themselves. We are all citizens of a planet and the planet will not endure pillaging forever. Many of the signs pointing to us that the indulgence of Mother Nature is past. The disaster of the last war was the cataclysm of rending force. By the light of that conflagration, we saw the immense strides made in science and technology of the modern world. We also saw the depletion and impoverishment of vast areas and the lowering of living standards. The conquest of space. The size of this planet and have shaken the individual man out of his indifference.

By Mayor O'Dwyer due to technical difficulties, but we will restore service in just a few moments. Others may quarrel with the bill. Still others may threaten to fight. But in the long run, and in the highest interest of mankind, the account must be squared. I believe that this old human race, sometimes so stupid, and sometimes so inspired, sometimes so vile, and yet sometimes so noble, must and will summon up the intelligence, the fortitude, and the grace to make an honest accounting and bail itself out of oblivion. Just as figures are universal, so do you, men and women of goodwill, speak a universal language. You speak the language of every man's heart's desire for security and for abundance. You speak of the just reward of labor, and of labor with a purpose. You speak of a better world for generations to come. Mr. Secretary General, Mr. Secretary Krug, and all the ladies and gentlemen of this conference, for the eight million people of New York City, I welcome you, and from our hearts, we wish you the greatest success in this conference. Thank you. This is the United Nations broadcasting from Lake Success.
