The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the bugle, I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, babe Goodbye, darling, I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am near the end Something tells me I am near the end He Road to the end when I am near the end Good-bye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on bodies, it won't be long, we're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray, we're going down south, hooray. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I've hunked us. Wondering, darling, if you're true. Distance only lands and shone lands. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near you. Be near your heart. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother, just because there is no other. She'll be happy till she met you, and the sun gets flowers. She'll be happy till she met you, and the sun gets flowers. You will see the word you said. That's the time we too shall wear.

Many hearts is waiting. If you'd greet them all. The heart of all. Come to me, sweet Marie. Not because your face is fair, love to see. But your soul, so pure and sweet, makes my happiness complete. Makes me falter at your feet, sweet Marie. Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that style? Isn't it a knobby one and just a proper style? I'd just like to have one just the same as that. Where'er I go, they shout, hello. Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir. Say au revoir. But not goodbye. But not goodbye. The past is dead. The past is dead. Love cannot die. Not goodbye. We'll better fall had we not met. I love you then. I love you then. Baby, baby. Baby, give me your answer too. I love crazy. Oh, for the love of you. It won't be a smiling marriage. I can't afford a family. But you love me. Oh, for the love of you. I can't afford a family. Oh, for the love of you. Oh, for the love of you. When you hear the rest of the things in me. Oh, joy, love. And crazy you must sing. And when the birds stand true. In the forest of the night is every hour. I can't afford your song. I can't afford it. When you hear the rest of the things in me. Oh, joy, love. And crazy you must sing.кой to Everything Museum Baby, baby. momento.
