They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad, who won your father's heart. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have ripped her apart. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow's heart. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow's last is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I see. Comrades, comrades, ever since we were boys, Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Comrades, when men were born, they blew all their eyes, we cried. When they just read us, my darling, old comrades, what's there by my side? There's a name that's never spoken, and a mother's heart have broken. There is just another one missing, from the old home that we belong. There is still a memory living, there's a father unforgiving, And a picture that is true, who's alone. She's my sweetheart, I'm a moat. She's my Annie, I'm a joe. Good real valley, never before With a lot of people in my sweet heart One evening in the month of May I met old Satan on the way I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die If you want to get to heaven in the good old way I'm going to get to heaven in the good old way I'm going to get to heaven in the good old way Rollin' on, rollin' on, rollin' on Johnny, get your gun Johnny, get your gun Johnny, get your gun, get your gun The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End
