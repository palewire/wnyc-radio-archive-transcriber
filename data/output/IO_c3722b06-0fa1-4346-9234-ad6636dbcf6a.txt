This is Ted Collins inviting you to listen now to your own program, Here's to Veterans, and introducing radio's most beloved personality, Kate Smith. Hello, everybody. It's a pleasure for me to take part in this program, Here's to Veterans, a quarter hour of entertainment and helpful information brought to you, transcribed, in cooperation with the Veterans Administration. It is dedicated to the citizens who served in our armed forces, now working shoulder to shoulder with their fellow Americans to make a stronger and better America for us all. Yes, here's to you, you veterans of Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, a note in music signed with affection by Kate Smith. Now, what's it going to be, Catherine? Rhythm or remembrance? New or old, too? Old, Ted, yet ever new. Can you guess the title? Tell me. That's it. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Why nights are lonesome. Tell me. Why days are blue. Why days are blue. Tell me. Tell me. Why all the sunshine. Why days are blue. Tell me. Tell me. Why all the sunshine. Why do I hate to go dear And hate to say goodbye Somehow it's always so dear And if you know, dear Please tell me why Why do I hate to go dear And hate to say goodbye Somehow it's always so dear And if you know, my dear Please tell me why You know, some folks like to use traveler's checks for safety and convenience on a long trip. But few of us would waste time by visiting the main office of the company that issues the checks. As we all know, these large companies use local banks for the convenience of their customers. So, to save time and trouble, we usually visit our nearest bank. Veterans, the same thing applies to your Veterans Administration. That's right. Your local VA office was established for your convenience. Generally, your individual files and records are kept in your local VA office. So, in most cases, if you write to VA's national headquarters in Washington, Your letter has to be routed all the way back to your local VA office So as to assure you the best possible service. So, why waste your own precious time by sending your letter the long way round? That's right, Katherine. That makes sense. So, veterans do not write to VA's national headquarters in Washington. Always write to your local VA office. And now that we've covered that little matter, Ted, let's get back to more songs, shall we? That's my idea exactly. And since this program is dedicated especially to veterans, And we know from experience that they have a fondness for rhythm tunes, How about doing one of America's popular show tunes of not so very long ago? Well, that suits me just fine, Ted. What musical comedy did you have in mind? Brigadoo. And the rhythm tune that I'm thinking of is pretty special, The way you sing it, that is. Here it is, Kate Smith singing, It's Almost Like Being In Love. What a day this has been, What a rare mood I'm in, Why it's almost like being in love. There's a smile on my face, For the whole human race, Why it's almost like being in love. All the music of life seems to be, Like a bell that is ringing for me. And from the way that I feel, When that bell starts to feel, I would swear I was falling, I could swear that I was falling, It's almost like being in love. And of the way, Yes Jeve upon the solar tanto versering. And I could swear it precisely, Well, And I could swear it was just me. Um, This time you survived first. It was done in hell. And, Oh, Nice draw. No, In A All the music of life seems to be Like a bell that keeps ringing for me And from the way that I feel When that bell starts to feel I would swear I was fallen I could swear that I was fallen It's almost like being in love Oh, I like the way you sing that song, Kate And I'm sure our listeners will agree with me And fellas, a while ago we told you That the proper place to write for quick and dependable service From the Veterans Administration is to your local VA office VA's local offices were placed where they are In order to bring prompt service to you They're located as close as possible to the places where you live And attend to your daily business So fellas, when you write to your local VA office You're helping the VA to help you And you might add, Ted, with a minimum of delays and disappointments Right Do not write to VA's National Headquarters in Washington, fellas Do not pile up possible delays and disappointments for yourselves By sending your letters the long way round Remember, in most cases, your individual records are on file in your local VA office Always write to your local office I repeat, do not write to VA's National Headquarters in Washington And now, Kate, for our final number, I'd like to make a suggestion It seems to me there was one song, more than any other Which held this nation together in unity and determination during the war Youngsters sang it in the streets Boys whistled it as they collected paper and scrap metal for victory Women hummed it with tears in their eyes to keep up their courage As they went about their daily tasks Men throughout the world marched forward to its refrain And as we look back at war and we think ahead for peace It's still a song that's uppermost in every American heart today Ted, there's only one song besides our national anthem that fits your description It's a song I was proud to introduce many years ago A song I'm proud to sing again and again God bless America That's it, Kate Then, and now, and forever God bless America God bless America Land that I love Stand beside her And guide her Through the night with a life from above From the mountains From the mountains To the prairies To the oceans To the oceans White with wolves God bless America My home sweet home God bless America God bless America God bless America God bless America God bless America Land that I love God bless America God bless America babe that I love Stand beside her과 poster이 the prairie, to the ocean, white with gold.

Once again we'll stroll near the mountains Through that rose-covered valley in you Each day is gray and dreary Here's to Veterans. Transcribed with the top flight talent of radio in cooperation with the Veterans Administration brings you your harvest of stars. Here's to Veterans. Here's to Veterans dedicated to the citizens who served in our armed forces now working shoulder to shoulder with their fellow Americans to make a stronger and better America for us all. And here's the star of Harvest of Stars, James Melton. Hello, friends. This is James Melton. For a curtain raiser on our Here's to Veterans tribute from your harvest of stars, we give you The Night Has a Thousand Eyes. Don't whisper things to me, you don't mean. For words deep down inside can be seen by the night. The night has a thousand eyes And it knows a truthful heart from one that lies The romance may have come in the past My love for you will be everlasting and bright As bright as the starlit skies And this wondrous night that has a thousand eyes I've lived my life walking through a dream For I knew that I would find this moment supreme The night of bliss and tender skies And the smiling down of a thousand eyes What a night of bliss and the tender sighs Of a thousand eyes You know, friends, a needle in a haystack is supposed to be about the hardest thing in the world to find. And veterans, it's millions to one that you risk the fate of the needle in the haystack if you write mystery letters to the Veterans Administration. A mystery letter is one that contains no clue to the identity of the veteran who sent it. And if you carelessly omit your full name and return address, if you fail to include full information about yourselves when you write to your Veterans Administration for information or for help, chances are that you're likely to cause yourselves unnecessary delays and disappointments. Later on, Don Hancock will tell you how to put full information into every letter that you write to the Veterans Administration. But right now, I have a song for you which is a favorite the world over. None but the lonely heart. None but the lonely heart. None but the lonely heart. None but the lonely heart. None but the lonely heart. None but the lonely heart. And, oh, my sadness. Our old and perfect power from joy and gladness. Heaven's boundless arch I see Spread out above me What a distant dream But one who loves me None but the lonely heart Alone my sadness Alone and far and far From joy and gladness My senses fail A burning fire devour me A burning fire devour me None but the lonely heart And oh my sadness And oh my goodness And now we turn our spotlight on Frank Black As he directs the Harvest of Stars Orchestra In the brilliant and popular novelty Fiddle Faddle. HD 5 Times I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Today, you'll be helping the VA to help you. For a quick reply and prompt service, always put full information in your letters to the Veterans Administration. Of course, most all of you have one favorite love song. Perhaps you have more than one. Or maybe you're like I am and just can't make up your mind. Why, if someone walked up and asked me to name my favorite, I'm sure I couldn't do it. But here's one I haven't sung for quite a while now. And it is one of the finest love songs ever written. The Song of Songs. Do you recall that night in June when first we met? Do you remember all of the words we spoke? Have you forgotten all of the tender vows we made? In the silent magical who seems like? Gone are the golden dreams with summer roses. And all our tender vows were made for to be broken. The song of songs, the song of memory. The song of songs, the song of memory. And broken melody of love and life. Nevermore to me can that melody fill the heart with joy once it knew. Oh, night of bliss, night of truth and love. Beneath the stars of mid-thirl roses. A dream of delight that's made at dawn. The song of songs, the song of songs, the night of bliss. The song of songs, the night of bliss. When you were my whole world of love. When you were my whole world of love. When you were my whole world of love. When you were my whole world of love. When you were my whole world of love. When you were my whole world of love. I will bring you music. As swiftly as a cloud. My song will fly. And that's the Here to Veterans tribute from your Harvest of Stars. With Frank Black and the Harvest of Stars Orchestra. Tune in again, won't you friends?
