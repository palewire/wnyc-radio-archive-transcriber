Here in this municipality and elsewhere throughout the country, there are millions of Americans who want to do their share and who feel that there must be some means by which they may individually express their love of America and of the freedom it personifies. Historic events take place each hour, events which have brought grave influences into our country. We all know too well the serious conditions confronting our right to be a free people and our right to pursue our lives, religion, and liberty as planned by the founding fathers of this republic. To protect these rights, we have undertaken the greatest preparations for national defense in the history of this country. Large numbers of our young men, many of whom are in the employ of the municipal government, have left their desks and have gone off to the training camps. Youth is making a great sacrifice, symbolizing the highest expectations which any country could expect of its citizens. But all the people of the United States cannot take up arms in defense of American integrity. Everybody, however, can aid in national defense through a plan by which the federal government is offering to each of us a chance to participate directly in this nationwide program. The cost of the national defense program, as now outlined, will be in the neighborhood of $40 billion. To help finance this gigantic expenditure, the Treasury Department has placed on sale in post offices and banks throughout the city, new defense savings bonds and stamps. This is a well-thought-out method of investment whereby your dollars and cents will be put to work for the defense of America. Of course you are all interested in just what kind of securities Uncle Sam is offering you. They are designed for every type of investor with a view to encouraging regular savings. They are just the things you have been looking for. To begin with, defense savings bonds are sold in denominations ranging from $25, the smallest, to $1,000 for the largest. The best part of it is that you pay only $18.75 for the $25 bond. The bond matures in 10 years. At the end of that time, your $18.75 has grown by one-third and you can cash it in for $25. Do you know how much that increase of $6.25 on your original investment amounts to? Well, very nearly 3%, or to be exact, 2 and 9 tenths percent compounded semi-annually. This is a fine return on your money today, a very profitable investment. Similarly, the $50 bond costs only $37.50 and the $100 bond costs $75. The larger bonds are priced accordingly. Dollar bills won't grow in your pockets, but your money put to work through defense saving bonds will give you a liberal return. In fact, the terms on these bonds are so liberal that the Treasury limits to $5,000 the amount of bonds which may be issued to any person during any one calendar year. For larger investors, such as trustees, corporations, insurance companies, associations or partnerships, as well as individuals, other defense bonds may be bought in amounts up to $50,000 worth in any one year. These pay a slightly lower rate of interest, approximately 2 and 1 half percent. Now, of course, there are many who do not feel that they can afford to spend $18.75 all at once for the smallest of these bonds. Uncle Sam has thought of these people, too, and wants to give them a chance to do their part. For their convenience, the post office will sell postal savings stamps at from 10 cents to $5 apiece. When you purchase these stamps, you will be given a card or album in which to paste them. The idea behind this plan is to give to every American an opportunity to buy these stamps regularly. When you have acquired $18.75 worth of the stamps, they can be exchanged for the $25 defense savings bonds. Saving has a special importance in national defense. If we spend money for things which we do not need, we put an unnecessary demand upon national production. We may, in fact, by such unnecessary spending, be competing with the federal government at a time when its needs are great and its demands immediate. By saving, and by investing these savings in defense bonds, every one of us can do our part for national defense. And at the same time, we can do it in such a way that we get a fine, safe investment yielding us a very high rate of interest on our money. Your government wants your active support. I know that my appeal will meet with the readiest response in New York City, which has always done its share in every emergency which our country has been called upon to face. Don't delay. Go to your bank or post office tomorrow. Purchase a defense savings bond. The sooner you start, the better for national defense. Thank you, Mr. McGoldrick.
