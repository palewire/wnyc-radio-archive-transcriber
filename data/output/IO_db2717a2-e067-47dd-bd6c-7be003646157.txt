In relation to the Committee on Finance, in favor of adapting, an annex report, in relation to the next report, relative to the financial state of the City of New York, as submitted to the Council by his Honor the Mayor on January 31st, 1939. Mr. Chairman, for the permission of the Councilman Kinsley is recognized. Councilman Kinsley is recognized. Councilman, I would like to take the opportunity to read in full the report of the Committee on Finance, to which the Clerk has just referred. Councilman will proceed. I believe that copies of this report have been furnished to each individual member of the Council. The meeting was held on Friday last, the 18th. The Committee on Finance, to which was referred the communication from the Mayor, dated January 31st, 1939, relative to the financial condition of the City, having duly considered the same, respectfully reports. The Mayor, at the outset, has asked the Council to submit suggestions for the reduction of a budget which has not yet been prepared, and will not see the light of day until submitted by him to the Board of Estimates on April 1st, 1939. Indeed, the Council has yet to be officially informed of the various departmental estimates as required by Section 114.1-0 of the Administrative Code. Your Committee concurs in the Mayor's statement that, quote, the Council has the power to reduce the budget, close quote. The Council has yet to be continued, but respectfully directs attention to the fact that it cannot even study the budget until it is submitted by him on April 1st. During the ensuing month, the budget remains in the possession of the Board of Estimates, and is not transmitted to the Council for action thereon until the first day of May. In the three weeks following, and on or before May 21st, the Council is asked to pass judgment on a budget which has been in process of preparation by the Mayor's own associates for more than six months. To remedy this situation in part, your Committee has submitted to the Council today three amended bills providing an additional ten days for its budgetary action by extending this time to May 31st, and yet providing ample time for the fixing of the tax levy on June 25th as required by the Charter. The Mayor states that the Departmental Estimates, quote, presented to date are far above the most optimistic estimate of revenue, close quote. Of this there can be no doubt. As the 1938 budgetary tax levy appropriations were within $220,638 of the 2% constitutional tax limit. It is well to emphasize at this point that the great bulk of the annual budget appropriations are expended by the Mayor's own appointees and the members of the Board of Estimates. Despite this fact, the Director of the Budget stated in the public press of January 29th that the Departmental Request will exceed the 1938 budget allowance by $50 million. I may interpolate here that since that statement the Budget Director has now issued a statement that it will be $52,500,000. It is well known that the Council is without any expert assistance to aid the committee in making the necessary study and analysis of the budget when it is submitted to the Council for consideration. Whereas the Mayor has an organization known as the Bureau of the Budget, consisting of a Budget Director, an assistant, and 75 examiners, accountants, engineers, inspectors, clerks, stenographers, etc. with an annual payroll of more than $290,000. On the other hand, the annual personnel budget of the Council, inclusive of the members of the Council, and its clerical help is less than $200,000. It is quite obvious from the foregoing that the Council is without the means or staff necessary to make a comprehensive study of the budget or to make recommendations concerning reductions unless provision is made at once for the aides required to assist the Council in this work of making an independent examination of the budget. However, if the Mayor desires to aid the Council in its consideration of the budget, and if he is sincere in his request to the Council to exercise its powers to reduce the budget, he can be of some assistance if he will instruct the Director of the budget to furnish the Council at once with the following information as to each department, bureau, board, or office. First, schedules shown by code numbers, line numbers, title, number of positions, rating amount, all new positions requested with the reasons therefor. Two, all filled positions dropped. Three, all vacant positions dropped. Four, all unfilled positions. Five, all requests for salary increases with the reasons therefor. Six, the schedule of all salary increments. Seven, a schedule by code showing all deductions for accruals with the comparative deductions for accruals in the years 1935, 1936, 1937, and 1938. Eight, schedules showing by departments the appropriations for special equipment such as fire apparatus, ambulances, laundry equipment, police motor equipment, and other equipment together with comparative appropriations for the years 1935, 1936, 1937, and 1938. Nine, detailed statements, and this is most important, of the salary modifications affected in each department between budget periods since the adoption of the budgets for the year 1938 and the first six months of 1939. Nine, therefore, in transmitting the budget to the council and its predecessor, the board of aldermen, the various appropriations and supporting schedules were combined, merged, and consolidated in such a way as to conceal the location of the various increases allowed and make difficult, if not impossible, the proper consideration of the proper consideration of the budget. Practically all of the information requested above is required to be furnished by departments to the director of the budget. It should therefore be furnished by departments to the council should the mayor so desire. The mayor has stated that he, quote, may be compelled within a short time to ask the council and perhaps the legislature to provide for the suspension of mandatory increases, close quote. Your committee respectfully submits that it is in no position to pass judgment on the necessity for such action on the part of the mayor until it has had full, complete, and ample opportunity to study every phase of the budget to be submitted by him. And until the mayor has furnished the council with detailed information of what he claims to be the effect of the alleged mandatory increases on the budget of each department of the city government. In the interim, the mayor can make the council's examination of his budget much easier by providing the information and assistance herein before requested, and by his cooperation in the enactment of legislation giving the council more time for budgetary action. In order to facilitate the council in its study of the mayor's plea, your committee has prepared and presents here with a table, which it believes to be novel in form, making an analysis of the 1938 tax levy budget allowances and allocating each to its supervisory source. As that budget, the 1938 budget was the first prepared under the provisions of the new charter, no attempt has been made at this time to compare the cost of operation of individual departments because of the difficulties caused by the changes, consolidations, et cetera, affected by the present charter. Appended there, too, is an analysis of the 1938 tax levy budget allocating appropriations according to the request. I have eyes to see with, but they see only you.
