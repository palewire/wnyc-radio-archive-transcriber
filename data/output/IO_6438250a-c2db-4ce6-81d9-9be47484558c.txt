Through the cooperation of the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, D.C., your city station has been granted permission to remain on the air past its customary sign-off time at 10 p.m. in order to bring you this special broadcast. We are speaking to you from the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel at 49th Street and Park Avenue in New York City, where New York's official banquet and reception to General Dwight D. Eisenhower is being held. The mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Fiorello H. LaGuardia, will preside. And now, ladies and gentlemen, his honor the mayor. I believe it's proper and fitting that one of the senior state officials, a son of the city of New York, should present to you this evening our guest of honor. I have great pleasure in presenting to you the presiding judge of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, the Honorable Irving Lane. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. General Eisenhower, today, on the sidewalks of New York, from its roofs and windows, from the borough grounds and parks, millions roared their warm welcome home to you. They brought you a wordless message, more eloquent than the most carefully chosen words could achieve. a message of affection for you as a man, and gratitude to you as the Supreme Commander who led the armies of the Allied nations to triumphant victory in Europe. That message I know went straight to your great heart from the great hearts of millions of New Yorkers. And believe me, sir, that the people of New York have great hearts. Since that night in November 1942, when our armies attacked in North Africa, we have shared your anxieties as we have shared your confidence in ultimate victory. And even when we grieve for the loved ones we have lost, we bore our losses with all the fortitude that we could suffer. It has been said that there are more Italians in New York than in Rome, more Irish than in Dublin, more Jews than in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. Doubtless you, sir, have heard some say that because of this diversity of racial and national nationality of the great principles of freedom and democracy, the great principles of freedom and democracy on which American institutions are soundly based, are not perhaps as deeply cherished or as well understood here as, let us say, in Kansas. And that our citizens will not make the same willing sacrifices to maintain what we call the American heritage. The names General Eisenhower on the daily casualty lists, which we anxiously scan with heavy hearts. The names on the list of men cited for heroism and selfless devotion, which we read with glowing pride, attest beyond challenge the worth of New York's immigrant sons. Those who say otherwise ignore the real spirit of America and the real spirit of New York. I once heard that spirit grammatically expressed by Al Smith, the happy warrior born in New York of immigrant parents, and John W. Davis, the accomplished diplomat, statesman, and acknowledged leader of the bar. We had a small private dinner in 1933, soon after Hitler became chancellor, a member of the German death commission. Then, in this country, cried with a skill never surpassed by rebels to persuade us that night the roots of Nazism lay in Germany's economic misery and that the way to destroy Nazism was to assist Germany to become a prosperous and satisfied nation. Al Smith then spoke up in his inimical way. He said, Sir, America can't understand that talk or accept that kind of excuse or explanation. Five years ago, he said, I ran for president. And I will say that racial and religious prejudices were without influence in that campaign. But I got over 15 million votes. And if the winners had attempted to put me in a prison or concentration camp, more than 15 million Americans would have marched on Washington and would have freed me. That, he said, is America. And Davis then broke in. And Davis then broke in and said, and the Davises would have marched side by side with the spirits. That, that is the spirit of America. As you, General Eisenhower, know perhaps better than any other. For you have seen Americans of British stock and of Irish stock, of Italian stock and of German stock and even of Japanese stock. Catholics, Protestants and Jews, but Americans of all. Talently marked shoulder to shoulder through heavenly self that government of the people, the people, by the people, for the people, should not perish from the earth. Talently, at your press conference in Paris, you gave expression to that knowledge. When in reply to a request for a comment on the contribution made by Negro soldiers, you said, I do not differentiate between soldiers. I do not say white soldiers or Negro soldiers. Mayor LaGuardia will surely agree with me that nowhere is the spirit of America more fervent than in New York, in the hearts of those millions who greeted you so warmly today. And that noisy greeting, with its eloquent message to you, of the city's warm affection and gratitude, still left unsaid, part of what was within their hearts. And I think the people of this city would wish me to bring you tonight a more smaller message than you heard. Last month, when the victory in New York, Europe was announced, there was some unrestrained joy, just as there was unrestrained rejoicing today. But almost immediately, the people of the city of New York, in sober mood, flocked to churches and synagogues, there to give thanks to the Lord, whose prophet had said that out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. Jerusalem. And men shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. And nations shall no longer lift up harm against nations, neither shall there be war anymore. anymore. On that day of victory, the same millions who today greeted you so joyously, Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, yes, and even men who reject all queens, worshipped the Prince of Peace, who taught all the world the way of peace, when in Jerusalem, he proclaimed for all the world to hear, that the two great commandments of the law, which God had proclaimed long before, on the slopes of Mount Sinai, were thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart and all thy soul, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. That was the law, that was the law, that was the law which went forth from Zion. That was the word of the Lord which went forth from Jerusalem. that was the law, that was the law which went forth from Jerusalem. And when all the world listens to the Prince of Peace, and obeys the commandments of the Lord, then will the kingdom of God be established on earth. And the word of the Lord will be fulfilled, for nation will no longer lift up arms against nation, neither shall there be war anymore. And so I say to you, General Eisenhower, for the people of this great city, that we, who have greeted you so tumultuously today, or so silently, love you deep in our hearts. Because never for a moment have you forgotten that American soldiers are not mere pawns in the game of war, but are loved you, and because you have loved them as we do. And we honor you, sir, because you, the man trained in the arts of war, commander of the embattled nation, who in righteous wrath took up their arms to defend their rights to live in peace, have alongside a Franklin Roosevelt, the peace-loving leader of a peace-loving people, brought the day nearer, when all men shall live secure in their own homes, fearing none and hating none. applause And now, New York City's latest and most illustrious citizen, General Eisenhower. Run the uno. UUA! helaas Unnett electriquement Unde E Un zipper Thank you. And the capacity crowd here at the Waldorf Astoria on a prompting from the balcony gives 3,000 cheers for General Eisenhower. Governor Dewey, ladies and gentlemen, to say that the hearts of myself and my comrades that have come with me from Europe are stirred by the reception from New York is the rankest kind of understatement. We have beheld scenes today that we didn't know were possible. Time and again, in the tour of the city with the mayor, I felt, and I know my comrades felt, that we would almost have to stop. But this wasn't the kind of thing to which we were accustomed. We were simple soldiers coming home from the wars, merely seeking the warmth again of America after what we had been through in Europe. But the emotions stirred by seeing people that would ordinarily be termed strangers, showing to us the countenance of friendship in such unmistakable ways as to fill our hearts to overflowing, and practically to bring tears to our eyes, was something that will be an experience to be remembered always. Before I go further, I want to say one thing in defense of the regular officer of the Army, brought to my mind by the wonderful commendation given to me personally in the introductory remarks. There is no greater pacifist than the regular officer. Any man who is forced to turn his attention to the horrors of the battlefield, to the grotesque shapes that are left there for the burial squad, he doesn't want war. He never wants it. He is an agent of his government to do a necessary and very desperate task. And it is to the welfare of the United States always to see that they have people studying those things and ready in the emergency to do what the regular officer has done in this war, namely, furnish the technical leadership for the tactical, applied tactical power of a whole nation. These tributes that were brought to me and to my comrades brought a curious idea to my head. I don't mean curious. I mean, it was one I hadn't thought of before. It was this. Why shouldn't America, as represented by New York, and I thoroughly agree that New York is representative of America, why shouldn't New York be celebrating what it has done? Don't ever let anyone sell short what America has done in this war. Not only has it been the arsenal of democracy, it has furnished some of the best fighting divisions, the best air forces, and the best navy that this world has produced. America's record in production and on the battle line is one that will fill our histories forever. And today, you should turn your thoughts to what you have done, and I mean you, America. And remember that you can do it, because self-confidence is one of the great things that brings greater achievements still in the future. We are still at war. I hope that the rejoicing in which we indulge because of the crushing of the Nazi will never blind us to the task we still have in the Pacific. The reason I bring this up at this moment is this. It is to your interest always to remember it. With the enormous quota that you have furnished for the battle lines, you have a tremendous interest in seeing that losses are minimized. Losses are minimized by producing the most powerful machine that you can possibly crowd into a given area of ground to defeat the enemy. If you apply on the battlefield equal forces, a bloody result is certain. If you apply overwhelming force, losses for your side are negligible. That is what you must do in the Pacific. Apply the maximum force that America is capable of developing, and you will win quickly and with the least losses. One of the things that you must remember particularly is production, because here, represented in many of its forms, financial, industrial, economic, New York is the heart of America. Production must be kept up, because when a bomb can do the work, let us not spend an American life for it. But this connection of yours with the battle line is no impersonal thing. Your quotas on the battle line prevent any such idea creeping into our thinking. And you can do more than merely your share in producing the arms and equipment that save American lives. There is a spiritual side to the soldier's life that is often scarred. I mean his opportunities for recreation, for feeling close to his homeboat. One of the ways that that can be helped is through the entertainment sponsor of the USO. It is something that deserves your support just exactly as does the Red Cross. They have done magnificent work and sent great artists to the field that have made the soldier feel he was back on Broadway almost. With your energy sustained at the full, our soldiers fighting in the Pacific, and by soldiers I mean all fighting services, not merely land animals, the victory in Japan is certain. With overwhelming force, it will come more steadily. When that job is done, there will be other problems facing you. Two of them I want to mention because they are related. They are jobs for men and peace in the world. Prosperous nations are not war-hungry, but a hungry nation will always seek war if it has to in desperation. We cannot be isolated from the world. From New York to my headquarters in Frankfurt is exactly 16 hours by air. You are that close to trouble all the time if trouble starts in Europe. It is to our interest to see that we are strong. To repeat the remark I made this note, Weakness cannot cooperate with anything. Only strength can cooperate. As I see it, peace is an absolute necessity to this world. civilization itself, in the face of another catastrophe such as we have faced in the last three years, and for other nations more, would tremble, or possibly decay, be destroyed. We must face those problems of peace with the same resolution that America showed in 1941 and 1942, when not the greatest optimist could believe that within 11 months after landing in Normandy, the American arms and Allied arms would stand triumphant on the Elves. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. No man can tell me that America, with its glorious mixture of races, of creeds, its Jews, its Catholics, its Protestants, it cannot lose, and we can't lose this one. promise you none. Thank you. I'll come here to you for the last, for all of these varaoOO 축 sundews. It's not hard on as low ngày, no DR, acまあ, there's not the light. Thank you.
