All of white and all of them, they love us for. The way of Johnny, I'll let him through my home. He is the first night of Caroline's party. Two little girls in blue, lads, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lads, who won your father's car. Became your mother, I married the other. But we have ripped her apart. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow's last is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manner too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I do. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Come, rat, when man was born, they blew all their life behind. When danger threatened, my darling old comrade, what's there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken. And a mother's heart have broken. There is just another missing from the old home that is all. There is still a memory living. There's a father unforgiving. And a picture that is all. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. She's my sweetheart. I'm her boy. She's my honey. I'm her boy. I'm her boy. All my heart are full. Could we rally know how to pass, who do not die for me? is my sweetheart.
