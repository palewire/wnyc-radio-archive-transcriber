From the Board of Estimate Chambers in New York City Hall, your city station brings you the mayor's official reception to the Chancellor of Austria, His Excellency Leopold Fiegel. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The End Accompanying Chancellor Fiegel are his wife and Dr. Max Lowenthal, Austrian Ambassador to the United States, to participate in the ceremonies which will include a presentation of the City's Medal of Honor by Mayor Vincent R. Impelletary. And now to open the reception, here is the Honorable Grover A. Whelan, Chairman of the Mayor's Reception Committee. Mr. Mayor, our distinguished guest, Chancellor of His Excellency, Chancellor of Austria, and the President. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a great privilege, Mayor Impelletary, to present to you His Excellency, who has been making a visit throughout the United States, and his history, as you well know, is one of great courage and great patriotism. I present to you Dr. Leopold Friedl. Dr. Whelan, Dr. Fiegel, Mrs. Fiegel, distinguished Ambassador of the Austria to the United States, ladies and gentlemen, A great privilege for me to welcome to the city of New York, His Excellency Dr. Fiegel. I have a great number of things in common with the Austrian people. Because for four months, way back in 1934, when Austria was still a free country and joined democracy, I had the great privilege of spending four months in your very delightful city. I enjoyed the hospitality of your people. I came to know them very, very well. And today, as mayor of the city of New York, I am very happy to reciprocate, in part, the great hospitality that was extended to me in those days in 1934. New York City doctor is very proud today. And the people of New York are very proud today to welcome the courageous statesman and leader of his people, who has played a leading part since the close of World War II in keeping his country firmly opposed to communism and who has proved himself to be a good friend of the United States. The distinguished European we honor today has been in our country the past two weeks as guest of our government and comes to these historic chambers. And comes to these historic chambers following his official reception in Washington and a brief tour of the East and Midwestern cities. It is appropriate that we extend a warm welcome to him in this, the United Nations capital of the world, because of his valiant efforts on behalf of freedom and democracy and his fierce and able opposition to totalitarian rule. As federal chancellor and head of the Austrian government since November of 1945, Dr. Fiegel has established a unique and distinguished record in post-war Europe for stability and singleness of purpose in upholding Western civilization against the inroads of the nefarious ideologies that would shackle the free men's way of life. In his talks and tours both here and abroad, Dr. Fiegel has sought to create a better understanding of Austria's great desire for unity and liberty. Because he opposed the annexation by Nazi hordes of Austria, he was arrested when the Germans took over his country and spent more than five years in and out of Nazi concentration camps. Even while facing the rigors of concentration camp life, Dr. Fiegel discussed there with co-patriots the formation of what was later to become the Austrian People's Party, of which he became the head. As a forceful statesman and able negotiator, he was successful in steering his coalition government through Austria's difficult period of post-war adjustment always with a true and a warm friendship for the Western powers and in cooperation with American policy. Only stubborn Soviet obstructionism and procrastination stand in the way of a treaty which would promote the restoration of Austria's full freedom and independence and cause the withdrawal of troops of occupation that are still stationed there. It is perhaps because the Chancellor comes from simple Austrian farm folk with the fegal acres of farmland in lower Austria in the family for more than 400 years that his love of Austria and freedom for his people burned so fiercely within him. As a distinguished Catholic and member of pro ecclesia and pontificia and holder of the silver cross of the Republic of Austria for distinguished service to his country, Dr. Fiegel, in his public utterances, has made it abundantly clear that he and his people will not waver from their resolve to preserve the same principles and ideals of freedom and democracy as the principles and ideals of freedom and democracy. And that they are determined to be in the forefront of the free and civilized nations of Europe. And that they are grateful for the assistance that has been given to Austria in the post-war period. We Austrians are citizens of the world and we want our country to be Europe's pole of stability. Dr. Fiegel said on the occasion of the first anniversary of Austria's liberation on May 9, 1946. Later that same year, in accepting an honorary doctor's degree of science from the Vienna Institute of Technology, Dr. Fiegel bespoke the philosophy that motivates his statesmanship when he said, and I quote, the basic principle of politics is to promote the welfare of the individual within the framework of society as a whole. Science strives to harness the forces of nature for the benefit of society and thereby of the individual. Today, one fact is unequivocally established, namely, that man and his welfare must be our prime concern. Woe to us all if materialism should ever triumph over the soul. Man and man alone should decide the welfare and faith of mankind, not the machine. The machine must be a servant of mankind. End of quote. Because his host city is the permanent seat of the United Nations, I should like to quote briefly from the Chancellor's speech on the occasion of United Nations Week in Vienna a few years ago when he said, and I again quote, it is an immortal service that the men who fashioned the charter of the United Nations have performed on behalf of humanity. This charter stands as a signing monument to mankind's dignity. It is a constant warning to those who, out of a thirst for power and irreverent narrow-mindedness, are ever ready to burden their conscience by resorting to brute violence. Austria considers it as one of her most important duties to serve the interests of peace and to make her youth mature and receptive to an understanding and appreciation of other peoples. End of quote. One of the most widely quoted of Dr. Fiegel's addresses is the one he gave to his own parliament on April 22nd of this year, in which he appealed to the conscience of the world for a treaty which would free his country. I should like to refer to it briefly and pull there from his impassioned plea for the freedom of his country, which is so justly deserved because its people for centuries have beat back the oppressors that sought to enslave Europe. We Austrians, said Dr. Fiegel, were the first foreign guests in Hitler's detention camps. Thousands died, and those who survived hoped for liberation. The statesmen in whose hands the fate of the great powers then rested, and who quietly sat by while Austria was being occupied, thought that they were acting in mankind's best interests. Although it soon became apparent that more oil was only being poured on the world conflagration, and that mass murder assumed even more gigantic proportions. But why should Austria be made to pay for these mistakes? Why should we, the first victims, suffer longest? From this parliamentary forum, I call forth to the world. Put an end to this shameful situation in Austria. Free this small, spirited, but hard-working people from its bondage and restore its liberty." End of quote. Dr. Fiegel, New York City is proud to welcome you today. It's eight million people, many of whom are of Austrian birth or origin. Extend the warm clasp of friendship to you, because you typify for us the fearless statesmanship and the intrepid leadership so sorely needed in the world today. It is now my privilege, Dr. Fiegel, to present to you the city's highest honor. And I would like to read it. It reads as follows. For distinguished and exceptional public service, Office of the Mayor, City of New York, know all men by these presents that I, Vincent R. Impeletary, Mayor of the City of New York, do hereby cite for distinguished and exceptional public service, His Excellency, Leopold Fiegel, Chancellor of Austria, whose public merits as a leader of the people in fighting strenuously for the reestablishment and preservation of freedom and democracy in Austria against any form of totalitarian rule for the sake of Western civilization and Christian culture, as well as the in upholding friendship between the United States of America and Austria have enlisted the heartfelt gratitude and deep appreciation of the people of the city of New York. Dr. Fiegel, it's my great pleasure to present you with this scroll of distinguished service. And at the same time, Dr. Fiegel, the City of New York, through me, has also asked me on this occasion to present to you the city's Medal of Honor. It's my great pleasure, Doctor, to place this medal on you in recognition of your perfectly wonderful service. New York City's Mayor, Vincent R. Impeletary, has just placed the Medal of Honor on our visiting dignitary for today, Austrian Chancellor, Leopold Fiegel, and also presented him with the scroll, which you have just heard read. They're posing for photographers right now, along with Mrs. Fiegel and the Honorable Grover A. Whelan, Chairman of the Mayor's Reception Committee. In just a moment now, we shall have the acceptance and response by His Excellency Leopold Fiegel, Chancellor of Austria. As you know, Chancellor and Mrs. Fiegel have been extremely busy since their arrival here on Sunday, May 11th, and their itinerary throughout the United States continues until they leave on Tuesday, May 27th. At one this afternoon, Mrs. Fiegel will be guest of honor at a luncheon given by the General Federation of Women's Clubs, while the Chancellor will attend a luncheon given by the overseas press club. There'll be a reception by the Austrian Consul General for early evening, and later in the evening, a dinner in honor of the Chancellor and Mrs. Fiegel by Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton Fish Armstrong. And now here once again is the Honorable Grover A. Whelan. Mr. Mayor, for the benefit of the unseen audience who are listening in, it's my great honor to present Dr. Leopold Fiegel, Chancellor of Austria, whose remarks will be interpreted by Dr. Martin Fuchs, a political advisor to the Chancellor and of the Foreign Office. Mr. Mayor, I forgot to, I learned after you made your remarks, Mr. Mayor, that the doctor understands English very well but does not speak it. Mr. Mayor, my dear, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor. Prime Minister Michaelこの胡ays、 the close to my understanding the웃 you have yes earlier has dug my sight. thousand and kulture houses. It's which box shows you the seriousness of this이라고이� It will get to give you the немного then the the juk j 퍼 war Mr. Mayer, I am deeply moved by the great honor which you have just conferred upon me, an honor which is the city of New York's highest award. This distinction is truly symbolic of this great and magnificent city, which exemplifies industrial and cultural progress, freedom, and democratic government for the entire world. Indeed, it carries a significant value for me as well as for my homeland. Der Leuchtturm der Freiheit, der von New York aus über den Ozean nach dem alten Europa scheint, ist die mächtige Stütze der geistigen und moralischen Werte unserer gemeinsamen Zivilisation, die jetzt jenseits des Atlantischen Ozeans so sehr bedroht ist. Sie ist das Symbol der großen Sendung, wie die Amerika und die Stadt New York in unserer Zeit ausersehen sind. Die Ehrenmitteile und die Urkunde, die Sie, Herr Bürgermeister, mir überreicht haben, bedeuten daher für mich und für das österreichische Volk nicht nur eine Anerkennung für an der Front des Kampfes für die Rettung der Zivilisation des Westens und der christlichen Kultur geleisteten Dienste, sondern die Ehrung wird uns gleichzeitig neuen Mut geben zur Verteidigung unserer gemeinsamen Tradition, die uns mit der Familie der freien Völker verbindet. Der Beacon der Freiheit, der aus dem Ozean nach dem Ozean nach der alten Europa, hält die spirituellen und moralischen Werte unserer gemeinsamen Zivilisation, jetzt so viel in danger da. Dieser Beacon ist das Symbol der Amerika und der New Yorker Mission in der Welt heute. Der Medal der Honour der Stadt New York ist, therefore, für mich und für die österreichischen Menschen, nicht nur ein Acknowledgement für die Services, die in der Vorbereitung der Western Zivilisation und der christlichen Kultur, sondern ein Acknowledgement für die Zukunft, zu stehen bei unserer gemeinsamen Tradition als Teil der Familie der freien Welt. Herr Präsident, besonders geehrt habe ich mich durch jene Stellen Ihrer Rede, in denen Sie, Herr Bürgermeister, meine Tätigkeit als Chef der österreichischen Bundesregierung erwähnten. Ich möchte Ihnen versichern, dass ich meine Pflicht nicht hätte tun können, ohne die mutige Haltung des ganzen österreichischen Volkes. Es wird mir eine große Genugtuung sein, nach meiner Rückkehr in die Heimat, meinen Landsleuten berichten zu können, wie sehr Ihr unerschrockener Kampf um die Wiederaufrichtung eines freien österreichischen Staatswesen, der so viel Leid und Opfer fordert, hier gewürdigt wird. Herr Präsident, I am especially honoured by the words of appreciation you have said, Mr. Mayor, for my work as head of the Austrian government. I can assure you that I could not have performed my duty without the courageous support of all the Austrian people. It is therefore to my countrymen that I will convey your appreciation of their courage in rebuilding a free Austrian state in the face of hardship and suffering. Es ist mir eine besondere Auszeichnung, Gelegenheit zu haben, Ihnen, Herr Bürgermeister, und der Bevölkerung der Stadt New York unsere tiefe Bewunderung auszusprechen für die gewaltigen Fortschritte und Errungenschaften, welche New York auf jedem Gebiet der Stadtverwaltung erzielt hat. Unter Ihrer hervorragenden Leistung ist diese große Stadt weiter ein Musterbeispiel für das friedliche Zusammenleben einer auf Gleichheit und Gerechtigkeit aufgebauten Gesellschaft, deren Tore jederzeit den Verfolgten dieser Erde offen stehen und welchen die Möglichkeit bietet, innerhalb einer kurzen Spannezeit nützliche Mitglieder dieser großen Demokratie zu werden. Es ist auch ein großer Privat für mich, zu haben die Möglichkeit, zu Ihnen, Herr Mayor, und zu den Leuten der Stadt der Stadt New York, unsere admiration für die gigantische Erwartungen in jeder Fälle der öffentliche Leben in New York City. Under Ihre inspirierenden Glauben, diese große Stadt weitergeht, um ein Model für eine peacefulen Gemeinschaft zu sein, basiert auf Equality und Justiz, ever ready to welcome the persecuted, giving them an opportunity to become, within a short period of time, useful members of this great democracy. Darf ich Ihnen, Herr Bürgermeister, aufrichtig danken und Sie bitten der Bevölkerung von New York, den Ausdruck meiner Dankbarkeit für diese hohe Auszeichnung zu übermitteln. Die enge Freundschaft, die das amerikanische und österreichische Volk immer verbunden hat und die seit jeher in so hohem Ansehen stand, ist für uns Österreicher unemperrlicher denn je, um unseren Entschluss, eine freie Republik zu bleiben, auszuführen. Die neuerliche Festigung dieser Freundschaft macht mich besonders glücklich, dass sie nicht nur zur Errichtung eines freien demokratischen Österreichs, sondern auch zur Haltung und Stärkung einer Weltordnung unerwässig ist, die auf Menschenliebe und Gerechtigkeit aufgebaut ist. May I thank you, Mr. Mayor, most heartily, and through you express my gratitude to the people of the city of New York for this distinguished award. The bond of friendship between the American and the Austrian people, which is held high in esteem, is now even more essential for us Austrians in our determination to remain a free republic. I am indeed very happy to see this friendship strengthened for the sake of a free and democratic Austria, as well as for the preservation and extension of a world order based on charity and justice. I have a selection from the police band and police glee club.
