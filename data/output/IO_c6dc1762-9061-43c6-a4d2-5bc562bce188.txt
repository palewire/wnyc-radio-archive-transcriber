Today's reception marks the arrival on its maiden voyage of the SS Flambeau, a new ship of the French Line. And now to open the ceremonies, here is the vice chairman of the mayor's reception committee, John A. Coleman. Ladies and gentlemen, I know we are almost happy to be here to the reception to honor the maiden voyage of the SS Flandre. And I wish to say, and this will be the end of the conclusion of the remarks on the delay, Mr. Mayor, we were held up slightly down the bay. But we're most happy to be here, and I would like to take this opportunity as your acting chairman of the mayor's reception committee in the absence of the wonderful Grover Whalen, who unfortunately had an accident over the weekend, that we had magnificent cooperation from all your departments down the bay, and the police department, the fire department, and the Commission of Marine and Aviation in person, and to the federal government, to the Coast Guard, and the collector of the ports office. It is a happy occasion for me, sir, as a substitute, chairman, to introduce to you and through you, to the people of the city of New York, the managing director of the French Line, Mr. Pierre Lohr, the commandant of the SS Flandre, Pierre Choupin, and the mayor of the city of Le Havre, Mr. Pierre Courant. Mr. Mayor, I introduce them to you and through you, to the people of the city of New York, officially. Yes, honor, Mayor Impoletari. Mr. Coleman, our distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, our great portals, this morning, or should I say this morning, this noon, perhaps a little after that, bestowed its traditional warm harbor welcome upon the new French liner passenger ship, the Flandre, and it is now my very pleasant privilege to receive its skipper and crew at this warm City Hall reception. We are honored this morning, or this afternoon, see I have to keep changing this text. This originally was supposed to take place at 1115. We are honored in having with us one of the French Republic's most distinguished citizens and statesmen. A member of the Chamber of Deputies of the French National Assembly and the Mayor of the City of Le Havre, home port of the SS Flandre, the Honorable Pierre Courant. Time does not permit even a brief recitation of the devoted and valiant service rendered by this great Frenchman in the rebuilding of his beloved native city of Le Havre, the continental terminus of the French line. Suffice it to say that this historic European port, which saw such ghastly destruction during World War II, which was the most of its buildings demolished and half of its population rendered homeless, is today launched upon a great reconstruction program largely due to the intelligence and zeal and devotion of its mayor, who is our honored guest today. We are equally honored in having with us a commander of the French French Legion of Honor and one who has served his country with great distinction during and since two world wars, the managing director of the French line, Mr. Pierre Lohr. This must be indeed a proud day for him as our city and nation, which have so many strong ties with his native country, extend their traditional welcome to this new luxury liner of the French line. And triple honors are ours today in welcoming the master of the SS flonde, Commandant Pierre Chopin, veteran of 34 years at sea and 32 years with the French line. This heroic skipper, who has under his command and has had many great ships under his command, he has commanded many ships that have crossed the ocean's lines and his long years of honored service have won for him many decorations, including the Croix de Guerre, the Merchant Marine Combat Bar, and the Atlantic War. The American War Zone Bar. The American War Zone Bar. Because he has been a great seaman in peace and in war, New York City proudly salutes him and his gallant crew. As token of the high esteem in which the city of New York holds our distinguished visitors, it is my proud privilege to bestow upon each of them the city's official scroll for distinguished and exceptional public service.

The principal reason of the greatness of Le Havre as a port is its wonderful location on the ocean. Traditional port of arrival for ships coming from New York and the cordial relations which exists between the two cities which dates back since its development. Each year we welcome at Le Havre a great number of American citizens and we know they felt badly at the conditions of our city after the liberation. And now they marvel at the great strides we have made in rebuilding in a few short years due to the tremendous efforts on the part of our people and with the great help of our big sister republic, the great United States of America for the good of the free world. We hope that our friends who see what we have accomplished will understand much better than France is not only a country of fine living but that our beloved country can and will surmount our misfortune and become the strong and beautiful country it was before the war. Mr. Mayor, in commemoration of the strong ties that bind Le Havre and your great metropolis, I have come to present to you the special medal minted with the coat of arms of the city of Le Havre, what we offer to you, to you, our good friends. I hope that in a world at peace, the exchange of friendship between our two cities will be a great manifestation of the affection and love which unite the American and French people. Thank you. Vive la France, God bless America. Thank you. Ocean port. And now the mayor of the city of New York is posing with the mayor of Flandre, the honorable Pierre Courant, mayor of Le Havre, rather, of France and deputy to the French National Assembly as the presentation of the silver medal to the city of New York from Le Havre, France is taking place. The color guard of the fire department is now leaving this mayor's reception room and shortly we are to have a selection from the police department orchestra and here it is. 있айтесь Estertvez saving every bucket dough Thank you.
