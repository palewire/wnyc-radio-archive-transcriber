I give you our beloved and cherished Mayor, General William O'Dwyer. General Simmons, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, my purpose here today is to give you the official city greeting to the memorial services who were, which are held today throughout the nation, to commemorate the memory of those honored dead, those men who fought for the freedoms which we enjoy and who paid the last full measure. Nothing that I could say on that could be improved upon what has already been said. I shall not attempt it. We know that there are many sad people in our nation today, the relatives and friends of those who died. To them, our sympathy, our love, and our constant promise of support in so far as we can help. To those who have gone, nothing more can be done for them. Their bodies now have been longed. In the clay, their spirits have been called to the Maker who gave them life. May the winds blow softly over their graves, whether it's in Europe or in some sand dune in the Pacific, no matter where they are. They're lonesome wherever they are. May the birds sing sweetly to them. And may you and I always remember them in our prayers. And let us here today tell them again that the liberties that they fought for, the nation that they loved and fought for and died for, our own United States, that we will be loyal. And if we are called upon to make that sacrifice as they did in its behalf, let us make the promise here today, ladies and gentlemen, we will make that sacrifice if called upon. Thank you. May I say that we have with us the leaders of the dominant war veteran organizations of this city participating in this program. United Spanish war veterans, the veterans of foreign wars, the American Legion of disabled American veterans, the Jewish war veterans, and the Catholic war veterans.
