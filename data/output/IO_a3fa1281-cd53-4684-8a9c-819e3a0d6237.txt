The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the fuck's on my heart I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, babe Goodbye, darling I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me, I am I am near Something tells me I am near I am near at the front to fight the foe Give the Matte And I amunt of theutan I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on bodies, it won't be long, we're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray, we're going down south, hooray.ìž¥ Ooh. Well, since makes the heart grow thunder, that is why I long for you. Lonely through the night I thunder. Wandering, darling, is your truth? Distance only lands and shams then, though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother just because there is no other. She'll be happy till her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, yes, we do. Christ, we see. When the sun gets flowers, no, he dies so free. Me, Christ, so dear. You will see the word you say. That's the time we do shall wear. When the harvest days are over, yes, be dear. My, yes, be dear. You will see the word you say. The day we would love with a strawberry crown, When the plant stayed on. He's life off the floor with a trail he adored, As the plant stayed on. But his brain was so loaded, it's nearly exploded. The poor girl would shake me along. He's there is a girl with a strawberry crown, But the plant stayed on. Sweet Adeline, my Adeline, At night, dear heart, For you I find. In all my dreams, Your fair-faced beans, You're the flower of my heart, Sweet Adeline, my heart, Sweet Adeline, Sweet Adeline, Sweet Adeline, Sweet Adeline, An hour, Is only a man in a fearless day, A beautiful ride to see. You may think he's happy and free from care, She's not the most she seems to be She's done when you think of her wasted life For you shall have made me wait And her beauty was sold For an old man's gold She's a bird in a gilded A little brown car A shady green spot So happier home I find My heart's barely gone I love only one She's the girl I have to be mine Just one girl Only just one girl Where on all the time Oh, God, there's not my heart But oh, hey She is just one day I'll be happy forever For the children's wonder I'll be happy for the children's wonder Wonder The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl like you. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrow, sharing each other's joy. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. They blew all their life, we cried. When they just read us, my darling, old comrade, what's there by my side? There's a name that's never spoken, and a mother's heart have broken. There is just another thing from the old home that we belong. There is still a memory living. There's a father unforgiving. And a picture that is true, true, long ago. She's my sweet heart, I'm her boy. She's my honey, my barcode. She's my honey, my barcode. Good real valley, never before. Good. I'm her honey, my barcode. She's my honey, my barcode. My honey, my honey, my honey, my honey, my honey. We are. One evening in the month of May, I met old Satan on the way. I looked old Satan in the eye. If you want to get to heaven when you die.
