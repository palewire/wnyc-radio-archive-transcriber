Early light, what so boldly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight for the ramparts we walked, were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, in air through the night that our flight was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the sea And the home of the brave To one of the most amazing audiences in the world, Miss Lucy Monroe, with the mass bands of the police, fire and sanitation departments, have dedicated the opening ceremony of I'm an American Day at the Mall in Central Park. Mr. Wayne Johnson will act as chairman and introduce the regular order of program. Mr. Johnson. The invocation will be given by the right reverend, Monsignor Francis X. Shea, representing his eminence, Francis Cardinal Spellman, Monsignor Shea. Lord, lift this mighty host that is America. Reconsecrate us in devotion to thee. Too often have we forgotten our heritage of faith. The mess of pottage to our eyes was dear. The gold within our coffers deadened us. We who by nature are between the earth and sky, Earth would have sunk and drunk of miraged visions. But now, reborn, we lift again to thee our nation's soul. Behold, we are thy wheat, nurtured beneath the sunshine of thy plains. We are thy grapes from vineyards in the sun, and timber from thy forests. Ours are the iron sinews torn from earth's deep rest, and oil from her rich arteries. O God, we build in you and dedicate again to thee the host and temple of America. Many we are in space wide worlds apart. But we are one today, made one by this our common will, that righteousness again shall walk among the sons of men. Now, welded of our pain, we would again be what our forebears were, men who did worship thee, and mindful of thy fatherhood, could reach to brothers o'er the sea a brother's hand. In every man we found thy image then, and finding, wrote our nation's creed, a pledge that made us the Samaritan to the oppressed and lowly of the earth. In those far days our soul was young and clear. We opened arms to all who suffered wrong. We bowed not in our youth, however strong the foe. For we were strong in our youth, and strong in faith that all men should know freedom, and worship thee in freedom as conscience should direct. We are a single host of grateful love for thee. A single will for universal peace for men. A single soul of righteousness to come. Lord, lift this mighty host that is America. Reconsecrate us now in thy son's holy name. Amen. In behalf of the mayor and the administration of the city of New York, I have the honor of the mayor and the administration of the city of New York, I have the honor of welcoming you here on this notable occasion. I am an American day. It is especially fitting that this celebration should come just at this moment as we look over the international and American scene. With the vexing problems confronting the nation and the world. It gives us pause and makes us reflect upon the meaning of being an American and to give thanks for our manifold blessings. Freedom is here. We must keep it here, but it must not be abused. We must hold out a helping hand to those unfortunates in Europe, now unhappily called displaced persons, and help them to obtain the blessings we have. We should raise our voices in behalf of Italy, where there are so many of our blood brothers, to oppose the imposition of reparations on a nation which joined us just as soon as we were thrust into the war and to whom we promised our help. Anyone taking reparations from her is taking of the substance we are sending her to help her to her feet. The great mass of our people demand that the contentious elements in our industrial and commercial life accommodate themselves to the general good of the whole United States and to settle their differences in the American way of open-handed dealing one with the other. Our America aims at freedom for all, economic security, social justice, and equal opportunity. Let us keep these objectives before us as our oral flame of peace as it was of war. We will now introduce Mr. James Sauter, who is the chairman of our entertainment committee for this afternoon. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Johnson. Mr. Mayor, Mr. Johnson, distinguished guests, people of the city of New York gathered here on this lovely afternoon in Central Park. We're going to start off this year with something we've never had a diamond American Day ceremony before. We have here in New York City a very wonderful organization of which our mayor is the head and which is run by Commissioner Nolan of the police department. That is our own police athletic league dedicated to taking care of the kids of New York. One of their great activities are the song activities which they're engaged in in the five boroughs. And so to start off our program today, instead of giving you the stars of Broadway, who you'll hear next, you're going to hear the stars of Broadway of 1956. These five kids up in the five boroughs, they are going to compete for an $100 bond, United States government bond, and the judging will be based exactly on the applause that you give them. And now, money from Brooklyn. Miss Monnie Vasquez, age 17, from the 88th Springsteen in Brooklyn, singing How Deep is the Ocean. And before we start, I want to introduce at the piano, Mr. Arthur Ford of the Police Athletic League, who's going to accompany these five young singers.

How far would I travel to be where you are? How far is the journey from here to star? And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry? How deep is the ocean? How high is the sky? How high is the ocean? That's wonderful, Moni. Now our next contestant for the Police Athletic League Singing Championship comes from Queens. He's 17 years old. He's at Newton High School. When they first gave me the program, it said here, Gerald Darcy. And he said, not Gerald, Jerry. This is Jerry Darcy. And he's going to sing for us all through the day. All through the day, I dream about the night. I dream about the night here with you. All through the day, I wish away a time. Until the time when I'm here with you. Down falls the sun.

And soon your lips recall. The kiss I dreamed of. Down through the day. There's a good day. Thank you Jerry. And now, from Staten Island. Oh wait. From Staten Island, this is a little one. Can they see you out there? Do you think, can you sing from behind here? I think so. Fine. This is Mary Howe. She's 17. And she's from the 123rd precinct in Staten Island. And she's going to sing, You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You. And I'm sure we're all going to love you, Mary. You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You. You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You. You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You. You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You. So find yourself somebody to love. The world still is the Savior never changing. The world still is the Savior never changing. The world still is the Savior never changing. You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You. So find yourself somebody to love. That was Mary Howes from Staten Island. Your applause is deciding the winner, you know. And the mayor is going to tell me which one had the greatest applause. Now from Manhattan, must be some people from Manhattan, singing My Johan, Helen Ferguson. And as she came up the stairs, she said, I'm 13, Helen Ferguson. exponhei nikola. I am your Jenny 2003.

Now, for some strange reason, the PAL has nobody here from the Bronx. And as always, when you don't have anybody from the Bronx, you have another person from Brooklyn. And so we have 17-year-old Margie Boyce here from Precinct 79 in Brooklyn singing the Ave Maria. Ave Maria City of Chicago George S. Ciud NV Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We all know the wonderful work that the PSAL, Public School's Athlet... I beg your pardon, Police Athletics School, I'm thinking of the early inauguration of the PSAL. The Police Athletic League youngsters have certainly shown up here today in wonderful colors, and their vocal artistry has certainly registered with the huge audience here in Central Park. The cameramen now are very anxious to have a picture of these youngsters, and the mayor is posing and shaking hands with each youngster as they come along and take their place in front of the mic. You know, it's a nice thing to have these pictures. The PAL, the Police Athletic League, is a young organization of its kind, and yet it's done a tremendous lot of good in translating the fact that the New York policeman is the youngster's friend. They have nothing to be afraid of at all. They take him in as a friend and a pal, and they discover all of a sudden what a wonderful place New York is through its precinct and police department. Harold Dwyer has just congratulated the person to five children who signed in this contest, and while the press has taken the pictures, you've had this little lull in the proceedings, which we think is a very well-justified lull. Now, we will continue with our program. Children, thank you all a million. We'll be seeing you in Madison Square Garden in December, I'm sure, at the Police Athletic League's big annual benefit. A big hand for the kids as they go off. We're now going to give you a cavalcade of stars of the Broadway musical shows. From the show Oklahoma, from Carousel, from Showboat, The Song of Norway, and The Red Mill, we're going to present the stars of each one of these shows in one number each. And our first introduction will be that of Jack Kilty and Miss Betty Jane Watson, the stars of that smash hit that's been in New York now for the past three years, Oklahoma. And they're going to sing that famous duet that you've heard often and that you can never hear often enough, People Will Say We're In Love. And Miss Watson and Mr. Kilty will be accompanied with the piano by Mr. Boris Colgan. Why do they think of stories that link my name with yours? Why do the neighbors gossip all day behind their doors? I have a way to prove what they say is quite untrue. Here is the gist, a practical list of don'ts for you. Don't throw bouquets at me. Don't please my folks too much. Don't laugh at my jokes too much. People will say we're in love. Don't sigh and gaze at me. Your sighs are so like mine. Your eyes mustn't glow like mine. People will say we're in love. Don't start collecting things. Like what? Give me my rose and my glove. Sweetheart, they're suspecting things. People will say we're in love. Some people claim that you are to blame as much as I. Why do you take the trouble to bake my favorite pie? Threaten your wish I carved our initials on that tree. Just keep a slice of all the advice you give so free. Don't praise my gentle march. Don't look so vain with me. Don't stand in the rain with me. People will say we're in love. Don't take my arm to march. Don't keep your hand in mine. Don't feel so grand in mine. People will say we're in love. Don't dance all night with me. Till the stars fade from above. They'll see if they're right with me. People will say we're in love. Thank you, Betty Jane Watson. Thank you, Jack Kilby. I don't think that show will ever leave Broadway. And by the same composers, by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, from the show Carousel, Miss Iva Withers is going to sing What's the Use of Wondering? Miss Withers? And we have to welcome Miss Withers doubly here today because on December 6, 1945, we took her over as an American. She became an American. She used to be a Canadian. A big hand for Miss Withers. I'm nervous. Nervous. What's the use of wondering if he's good or if he's bad? He's your feller and you love him. That's all there is to that. Common sense may tell you that the ending will be sad. And now's the time to break and run. The use of wondering if he's good or if he's bad. He's your feller and you love him. He's your feller and you love him. That's all there is to that. Common sense may tell you that the ending will be sad. And now's the time to break and run away. The use of wondering if the ending will be sad. He's your feller and you love him. There's nothing more to say. Oh, it's a good day. And now's the time to break and run away. I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I'm nervous. If the ending will be sad He's your feller and you love him There's nothing more to say Something made in the way that he is Whether he's false or true And something gave him the things that are his One of those things is you So when he wants your kisses He will give them to the lad And anywhere he leads you You will roar And anytime he needs you You'll go running there like mad You're his girl and he's your feller And all of the rest is talk Thank you, Ivor Now from the same show from Carousel Singing If I Loved You, Mr. Harold Keel Harold? And still at the piano, Mr. Boris Colgan If I Loved You Time and again I would try to say All I'd want you to know If I loved you Words wouldn't come in an easy way Ground in circles I'd go Longing to tell you But afraid and shy I'd let my golden chances pass me by Soon you would die Soon you'd leave me hoped you would go In the mist of days Never, never could I I love you, if I love you. Thank you, Harold. And now from Show Boat, that star of stage and screen and radio, Miss Carol Bruce, and she's going to sing a song dedicated to the boys of our World War II, that lovely song of Frank Lesser's Roger Young. Oh, they've got no time for glory in the infantry. No, they've got no use for praises loudly sung. But in every soldier's heart, in all the infantry, shines the name, shines the name of Roger Young. Fought and died for the men he marched among. To the everlasting glory of the infantry, live the story of Private Roger Young. On the island of New Georgia, in the Solomon, stands a simple wooden cross, a loan to tell. That beneath the silent corral of the Solomon's, sleeps a man, sleeps a man, remembered well. Roger Young, fought and died for the men he marched among. To the everlasting spirit of the infantry, live the spirit of Private Roger Young. The The name of Private Roger Young Shines the name Roger Young Thought and died for the men he marched among To the everlasting glory of the insom tree Is the story of Private Roger Young And now from the song of Norway, its great singing star who has left, taken leave for a season or two from the Metropolitan Opera, where she is also a very great singing star, Miss Ira Patina. And she is going to sing three loves from the song of Norway, accompanied at the piano by Mr. Frederick Kitzinger, who is the conductor of that show, Miss Patina. The words in rhyme, the worlds I live in become propelled by fools to arms, I am holding three loves have I, three of flame in my heart, and my life's a frost as like a moon. The words in rhyme, the words in rhyme, the words in rhyme, and my life's a frost as like a moth, a moon. The words in rhyme, the words in rhyme, and my life's a frost as like a moon. The words in rhyme, the words in rhyme, and my life's a frost as like a moon. The words in rhyme, the words in rhyme, and my life's a frost as like a moon. The words in rhyme, the words in rhyme, the words in rhyme, and my life's a frost as like a moon. The words in rhyme, the words in rhyme, the words in rhyme, I have To say, a universe in rhyme, and the words in rhyme, and my life's a frost as like a moon. My first love is to laugh, another love is to sing. My third and greatest is my love. For you, can't be all my life. And now that Miss Patina is through singing, let me tell you that she too is an American and has been an American for the last nine years. And now from the Red Mill, Miss Ann Andre, not singing a song from the Red Mill, which is one of Victor Herbert's great hits, but another of Victor Herbert's great songs, the Italian street song from Nori Marietta, Miss Andre. And Miss Andre is accompanied at the piano by Mr. Arthur Roger. Mr. Roger. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now, Mr. Mayor and Chairman Johnson, I called this morning on the telephone a little after 12 o'clock because while we were listening in on the WNYC broadcast during the day to find out whether or not the Lord was going to permit us to have I Am an American Day without rain, we happened to hear on a concert program which is done on WNYC every Sunday morning, a young artist program, a young lady a la Goldberg. I called her up with the mayor's permission to invite her to be a last minute addition to our program because it seems so appropriate that our New York City station, of which our mayor is the head, that they should be represented here in some way today. And so we have at the cello the young American Miss Ella Goldberg and at the piano her father, Johann, and turning the pages for her father, her mother. That's really an all-American family. Let's give them a big hand. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The End The End The End The End The End Thank you, Papa and Ronald Goldberg and Little Ally. A big hand for the three of them, please. Goldberg. And now it's my privilege to present to Mayor O'Dwyer and to Chairman Johnson and to you, the people of the city of New York, that very great American soprano, Miss Dorothy Mayner, who accompanied at the piano by Mr. George Schick will sing three songs. The first Going to Ride Up in the Chariot, then Shoebear's Ave Maria, and then Lead Company Along by Hagemann, Miss Dorothy Mayner. Thank you. The End The End The End Thank you. And now, ladies and gentlemen, and now ladies and gentlemen, if we'll be seated, we're going on the air coast to coast. And may I present to you again the chairman of our I Am an American Day Committee, the Honorable Wayne Johnson. Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson. Thank you. Mr. Johnson. Mr. takes our time to try to squeeze and move us out of the steamboat by H mailing got some Koskoor. This has been solutions for載らiously and makes the place run up a little bit crazy. Vanceário and Ham beons probably as good as one of the intervenes in our flagship nights because of us. Mr. Johnson. Thank you. Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson. For profits and thenen University from WNYC, here's New York City. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In the presence of over 500,000 people at the Mall in Central Park, the Mayor of the City of New York, representatives of the city, state, and nation, we are celebrating at this time I Am an American Day, and we now present the Chairman of the Occasion, Mr. Wayne Johnson. On account of color, race, or creed. These qualities are so much a part of him that he is an American through and through. Our institutions and our way of life are inseparably a part of him. It is my great honor to present the Mayor of the City of New York, Honorable William O'Dwyer. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We are gathered here today, thousands upon thousands of Americans, to reaffirm our allegiance and faith in our nation and its institutions and ideals. Today's celebration of I Am an American Day has a special and most important significance. It is the first celebration of I Am an American Day has a special and most important thing to be held since the war against aggression ended in the glorious victory for our democracy. This is a great American holiday. It was inaugurated when our nation was still at peace. It continued during our participation in the war and provided us with an opportunity to emphasize our affection and admiration for the men who were fighting our nation's battles throughout the globe. As the mayor of New York City, which sponsors this event, I am proud of this gathering. We owe it to our country and to ourselves to celebrate this day year after year. Since the last peacetime gathering on this mall in Central Park, hundreds of thousands of our American youth suffered deaths and injuries to preserve what we here today will once more pledge to maintain our democratic ideals and our American way of life. We are sometimes inclined to accept the blessings of citizenship in this great nation without fully realizing the inestimable pleasure it represents and without fully comprehending the responsibility we assume in the honor and privilege of citizenship. When a citizen of this great nation without fully understanding the inestimable pleasure it represents and without fully understanding the freedom of oppression. When a citizen of this great nation without fully understanding the inestimable pleasure it represents and without fully understanding the freedom of oppression. It means with that expression that he enjoys the freedom from oppression. Freedom from want. Freedom from fear. That he is assured of equality and justice. that he is assured of justice. And, further, that he is also entitled to freedom of religion and freedom of opportunity regardless of race, colour or creed. There is no other land where citizenship gives such guarantees. There are foreign-born among you who are awaiting that thrilling moment this afternoon when you will receive full citizenship in this nation. There are among you men and women refugees from persecution and oppression. I myself am a naturalized citizen. I know the feelings of you who are about to take the oath of allegiance this afternoon. It is a moment in your life you will never forget. From this day on, you can participate in the life of this country as an American and not just as a resident. I believe that I express your feelings when I say that all the naturalized citizen desires is complete recognition of his good faith and intentions from fellow Americans. In return, the naturalized citizen will assume the full responsibility as an American. But citizenship in this nation, while it grants the greatest individual liberty man has ever enjoyed, does not mean that such liberty should be corrupted by any misguided conception. liberty does not grant the right to increase. It does not encourage, nor does it mean to encourage, the fostering of strange ideologies contrary to our form of government. citizenship in this nation permits participation in our government by all citizens, for it is a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. The liberty granted to all of us by citizenship in this nation brings with it a sacred responsibility to protect at all costs the government and the laws and institutions which we all swear to uphold when we take the solemn oath of citizenship. citizenship. It also brings with it the responsibility to guard against the forces of intolerance and bigotry. No one who violates this oath can be a good citizen. There is no better way to epitomize the motive and the purpose behind this gathering today than the American's Creed, written by William Taylor Page. I want all of you here to turn to the back page of your I Am an American Day program and repeat after me the words of the American Creed. Will you please rise? Repeat. I believe in the United States of America as a government of the people, by the people, for the people, whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed. I believe in the United States of America. A democracy in the republic. I believe in the republic. I believe in the republic. A sovereign nation of many sovereign states. A sovereign nation of many sovereign states. A perfect union. A perfect union. A perfect union. One and inseparable. One and inseparable. Established upon those principles of freedom. And from all of the world. Equality. Of all of the world. Justice and humanity. Justice and humanity. For which American patriots. For which American patriots. Sacrifice their lives. Sacrifice their lives. Sacrifice their lives. And fortunes. And worth. I therefore believe. And I therefore believe. It is my duty to my country. To love it. To love it. To support its constitution. To support its constitution. To ordain its law. To ordain its law. To respect its land. To respect its land. And to defend it against all enemies. And defend it against all enemies. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. The Honorable Murray Halbert. Judge of the United States District Court. We will now deliver the Pledge of Allegiance. And I will now present the Honorable Murray Halbert. Chairman Johnson. Mayor O'Dwyer. Distinguished guests. Specially honored guests. Ladies and gentlemen. And fellow Americans. Again we are gathered here. To attest our loyalty. And pledge our allegiance. To the very last alien born person. To become a citizen of this republic. There was administered an oath. In the prescribed form. By a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction. During the past year. Approximately 50,000 persons heard. And subscribed to this oath. In this metropolitan district alone. They are our honored guests here today. And welcome. To the metropolitan district alone. They are our honored guests here today. Thank you. And welcome. I'm here to your host. And welcome. I'm here to the refugee. And welcome. I'm here to thank you. I'm here to thank you.
