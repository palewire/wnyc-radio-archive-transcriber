The End Two little girls in blue, lads, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lads, who won your father's heart. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted above. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow's last is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I'm true. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's strides. The rest of the man who was born, they blew her dear, I'd be kind. When they just read us, my darling, no comrade was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken, and the mother's heart have broken. There is just another thing, from the old home that we belong. There is still a memory living, there's a father unforgiving. There is still a memory living, there's a mother of the old home that we belong. There is still a memory living, there's a mother of the old home that we belong. That means, dear, he's my sweetheart. One evening in the month of May, I met old Satan on the way. I looked old Satan in the eye, If you want to get to heaven when you die. If you want to get to heaven in the good old way.

For for the love of you, it won't be a striving marriage, I can't afford a family. But you don't speak, but I speak, I think so good for you. When you hear the rest of things in me, a dying love, a crazy human thing, and when the birds stand true, in the forest of the day, there will be a hard time, you'll come to night. I sing it when you hear the rest of things in me, a joy, love, a crazy human thing, and when the birds stand true, in the forest of the day, there will be a hard time, you'll come to night. Neither of us canons, anyESS, I'll come to night. Thank you.
