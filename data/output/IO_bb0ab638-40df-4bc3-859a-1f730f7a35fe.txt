The city station and the microphones of networks and all other facilities are in the council chamber. It's very interesting broadcast. Regrettable indeed that we can bring you the picture as well. When the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, receives His Excellency Miguel Alamón, President of Mexico. There's been a great deal of advance information on the visit of the President of Mexico to our country since we all know the particulars and the magnificent pageantry. That was a factor in the federal welcome to the President of Mexico when the President of the United States, President Truman, welcomed our distinguished neighbor from the South in Washington, D.C. Well, the only meaning in the crowd today is the weatherman. He hasn't sent us the best day possible, but as Al Jolson would say, it's raining violets, so if you want to accept that discount, why, it's all right. A great number of people have turned out in a national Mexican costume, and it lends indeed a remarkably interesting color to the pageant today, a little touch of folklore that we don't often get, because on most of these occasions, everyone is all dressed up in their best bib and tucker, a la Hottie Carnegie, and Earl Benham and so forth, and we don't see much of the national aspect. Yet the Mexicans have turned out in their colorful national costumes, hundreds of them in front of City Hall, and the military display from Fort Jay is indeed a very impressive one. On a balcony outside City Hall, especially arranged in the park, within good focusing distance of all that is to take place here today, your movie cameras are busy grinding and making a record of today's event. One of the splendid things about movies and cameras is the fact that we can always recapture the event, who is there, what they look like, and all about it, in future times when we're trying to get a better idea of history, why there's the picture, and the words naturally are easy to put together. A picture can kill a million words, and sometimes it does. We're just waiting expectantly now, because those who arrived in the vehicles with the President of Mexico, Mr. Whelan and the Mayor, why they're doing their best to get into the small colonial confines of this truly beautiful building, City Hall. We can't help thinking what an extremely fortunate circumstance it is that our thoughtful forefathers put together in the exact proportions of beauty that the City Hall does obtain, so that it really makes an interesting background from any angle that you would like to take a picture. The magnificent hallway, that staircase which is so impressively beautiful, the crystal chandeliers, the governor's room, the furniture from old Federal Hall, when the government of the United States was established first under President Washington at Nassau on Wall Street. All these things are recapitulated right here and brought forcibly to our mind. The very idea of the building itself gives us some idea of what the forefathers thought was an adequate building for a city like New York at the time. Well, one of the standing jokes is the fact that they never put the white marble on the back of City Hall because they said it would be centuries before the city went that far. Canal Street was the scene of the Lisbonard Farm, and the only reminder we have of that now is the fact that Lisbonard Street is just a block below Canal Street, and we get some idea then of the early beginnings of the colonial picture at the time. And yet we imagine, from the standpoint of colonial times, this building was huge indeed. If anyone doubts the sincerity and the pride and the joy of the Mexican people that are fortunate enough to be here in New York City, they should see the unqualified wreaths of smiles, their faces, their flowers, their color. Everything is happiness supreme. They feel indeed very happy about the visit of the president of their land here in New York City, and one of the factors of City Hall is the fact that at this focal point, all these historical factors culminate in the reception which the mayor of the city of New York presents and extends to those who have accomplished. And no city in the world loves to recognize accomplishments so thoroughly and completely as New York City that has accomplished so much. The only delay now is the fact that you just can't move in the aisle of the council chamber just at present, since those who arrived in the cars are jamming the aisles, but the police department is doing their usual smiling, pleasant, shall I say, job on an occasion like this. Would it be prodigal? But they're arranging it very nicely, and the people are finding space where there didn't seem to be any. And even people are moving over, and where one person sat, well, in some occasions, two people are managing to sit. Depends on the destiny that shapes our ends. We're just waiting expectantly now. President Aleman, the mayor, Mr. Whelan, and the distinguished group of citizens who are on the committee welcoming the president of Mexico have adjourned to the governor's room at the head of the staircase here in City Hall so that some sort of order can come out of the late arrival of guests. The police officers are now distributing those who cannot find a seating room around the walls, the beautiful paneled walls of this council chamber with its magnificent painted ceilings with the escutcheons of the five boroughs and the civic goddess enthroned in the middle panel and, again, surrounded by the escutcheons and coats of arms of the boroughs. And now, ladies and gentlemen, here is the mayor of the city of New York. Mayor of the city of New York, escorting His Excellency, Miguel Aleman, president of Mexico. Some of the little Mexican children there in the aisle in their Mexican costumes stepped out of line, police or no police, and they gave their beloved president a very warm shake hand. He stopped a moment. So did the mayor. And now, through this tremendous concourse, the mayor is finally able to make the rostrum, and the president and the mayor are on the rostrum now in the council chamber. The Mexican and American flags are waving. The cameramen are shooting. Let's hope the day will come when the only shot in the world will be a camera shot from one of the men holding a camera. These familiar faces, particularly to anyone who has handled these occasions at City Hall, it's interesting to see the familiar faces of the cameramen that have participated for years in these things. That's why we receive such expert coverage at all times of any event that takes place. And if the president of Mexico thinks he has ever faced a barrage of any kind, he's never quite equal to the one that's flashing lightning now in front of the, ordinarily, the council president's chair here in the council chamber. It's a very fine arrangement of rostrum and chair so that the distinguished guests have every possible vantage point. And yet, the room itself performs wonders regardless of its size. It's interesting to watch Mr. Morris' portrait of Lafayette, who invented, Mr. Morris invented the telegraph, you know, and so few people know he was a fine artist. And now Mr. Whelan is speaking and presenting his guest. Mr. Whelan has just spoken. He has announced the singer. The two anthems will be sung, the American and the Mexican anthem. Mexicanos al grito de guerra, el acero apresca del brinón, y retiembla en su centro la tierra, al sonoro rugir del cañón. Y retiembla en su centro la tierra, al sonoro rugir del cañón. Siño patria, tus sienes de oliva, de la paz del arcángel divino, en el cielo tu eterno destino, por el dedo de Dios escribió, mas si osare un extraño enemigo, profanar con sus plantas su suelo, piensa patria querida del cielo, un soldado en cada hijo de Dios, si un soldado cada hijo de Dios, mexicanos al grito de guerra, el acero apresca del brinón, y retiembla en su centro la tierra, al sonoro rugir del cañón. Y retiembla en su centro la tierra, al sonoro rugir del cañón. Just heard Mr. Thora's sing the Mexican anthem, and now Miss Manning of the Chicago Opera Company is announced by Mr. Whelan to sing the American anthem. Sing the national anthem. Oh, say can you see By the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming, Who brought stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight, For the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming, And through the perilous fight, The ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming, And through the perilous fight, Probably theicho, The ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming, And by the fårade destiny led to the fight, For the ramparts we watched The ramparts we watched If you heard of 불wuk terror in the fire, In the Deixa Hehken brown Amin' of the brave and the heart of the brave. Maestro Celebré and the Department of Sanitation Band, that excellent organization of musicians who have played so often on these occasions accompanied the two singers. And now Mr. Whalen. Mr. Mayor, it is a great privilege to present to you, His Excellency Miguel Alamón, President of the Republic of Mexico. Well, again, the shooting, I mean the cameras, of course. And it's an excellent opportunity to combine the picture of the President and the Mayor. President Alamón. Your Excellency, today the great city of New York is extremely proud and happy to pay tribute to our most distinguished visitor, President Miguel Alamón of the Republic of Mexico. In the Council Chamber, in this historic City Hall, we have assembled for this official reception to the Chief Executive of our Southern friend and neighbor. here, many celebrated international figures have been accorded the heartwarming greetings of this metropolis of the world. None was ever more welcome than His Excellency President Alamón. President Alamón. President Alamón symbolizes the bond of friendship that exists between the Republics of Mexico and the United States. He and his fellow citizens recently demonstrated in eloquent fashion their affection for the United States when they graciously entertained President Truman with characteristic Mexican hospitality. I believe it was Wine Street about Mexicans and the United States. Very warmly inspired b china, in new places to unmute uporation your eyes lovely podcast, And the � mmstep fixer of Base bachelors and the Mexican собственно-lo yükhe umproductions and therière Britannic for this nation and the American people has been demonstrated on many other occasions. Republic of Mexico joined with this nation in the world battle for freedom and that her troops served with ours in the liberation of the Philippines. We must never allow comradeship of the battlefield to become a victim of peacetime indifference or misunderstanding. I am confident the mutual affection of our two great peoples will grow even stronger with time and that Mexico, under such enlightened leadership, will gain even greater stature among the nations of the world as a bulwark of progressive democracy. This visit of your excellency provides us with a long desired opportunity to show our genuine affection for you and the people of Mexico. As mayor of the city of New York and on behalf of the citizens of our city, I bid you, sir, a cordial welcome. Furthermore, I do hereby cite for distinguished and exceptional public service the Honorable Miguel Al-Aman President of Mexico, Chief Executive of our great and friendly neighbor nation, who has contributed immeasurably to the understanding between the Republic of Mexico and the United States, to emphasize the esteem and affection in which the great President of Mexico and her citizens are held by the people of our city. I have the honor to confer honorary citizenship of the City of New York upon our distinguished visitor. The mayor of the city of New York has just presented the scroll to President Al-Aman of Mexico, and you're not seeing it over the radio, but your cameramen are in there shooting away, and you'll get pictures in all the papers tomorrow. The movies will record it. In fact, every facility for recording this event by pictures is being thoroughly undertaken by the cameramen. And I've seen barrages of cameramen before, but not quite as many as are here. And I notice there are a great many, apparently, from Mexico and Spanish-speaking organizations as well. And now we'll... Oh, well, prodigal vanishes when the cameramen get busy because they just take pictures, whether the anthem's playing or anything else, and we understand why. Because a picture is a picture when it happens, not possibly when the opportunity comes to take it. And when they see something that looks like a picture, they take that picture. And the temporary suspense of prodigal is pardonable in this particular case. And years later, when we go to the files, I should be technical and say the morgue, but I hate the word, of the newspaper offices, and pull out these pictures, then indeed the graphic story is told. Mayor O'Dwyer. It is now my honor and privilege to present to you His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Mexico. President Aleman is certainly receiving a most cordial welcome here in City Hall today. You've just heard Mayor O'Dwyer present him. He's begging them to keep quiet so that he may speak. And now the President of Mexico. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
