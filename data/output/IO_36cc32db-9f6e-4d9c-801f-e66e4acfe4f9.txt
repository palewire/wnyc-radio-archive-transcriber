Our city station now offers a special United Nations Day presentation. Here is Dr. Herman Newman, Music Director of the Municipal Broadcasting System, to introduce the program. This is United Nations Day, and we are happy to present a special edition of Hands Across the Sea, in cooperation with that great and vital American organization, the National Federation of Music Clubs. Your Master of Ceremonies for the program is my very good friend, Dr. Sigmund Spaeth, popularly known as the Tune Detective. Dr. Spaeth is chairman of the Radio, Television and Motion Picture Committees for the National Federation of Music Clubs. And it's a pleasure to have Dr. Spaeth with us. Thank you very much, Herman Newman. I'm delighted again to be permitted to act as Master of Ceremonies for this program on United Nations Day. And I have two very fine young artists to present to you, and also some very interesting speakers, in the course of the next 45 or 50 minutes. Our first artist is Claudette Sorrel, S-O-R-E-L, who is the young winner in the piano competition, the Young Artist Contest of the past biennial in Salt Lake City of the Federation of Music Clubs. And she has since that time become a well-established artist in her own right. She is still very young. I won't give away her actual age, but I might say that she has given three town hall recitals, the first of which was at the age of 13. So she's just getting into her 20s now. And she has played with all the leading orchestras of the country. She has given recitals in many other cities. She not only was the prize winner for the National Federation of Music Clubs in the last contest, but she has won a number of other prizes, including the one of the RCA Victor Recording Company. In fact, she is the youngest artist to record for RCA Victor. So I think I will let Miss Sorrel's playing speak for itself and simply tell you the numbers which she will introduce, representing the music of various countries. That's what we're emphasizing in this program this morning. So first of all, two short pieces by Brahms, who is, of course, German, but wrote music that is worldwide in its significance. That is what we feel about all great music, that it transcends nationality. And so for her opening numbers, Claudette Sorrel plays the intermezzo in E major and the capriccio in D minor of Brahms from his Opus 116. Miss Sorrel.
