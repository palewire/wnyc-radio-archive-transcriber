And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabelle de Bore, accompanist, in I've Got Plenty of Nothin'. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks is plenty of plenty, got a lot on the door. Oh, great somebody's a-goin' to rob them, but without them make him more. What for? What for? I've got no lot on the door, that's the way to be. Take and steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that are tied, like the stars in the skies are all big. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my song, and the heavens a-whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord, got my dog. I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no sun, and the moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of plenty, got to pray all the day. He's the plenty, you're not the warrior, he's the devil away. Away, away. Away, away. I am the friends of Hell, and it's not the right. There's never one way long as I'm well, there's never one who's tried to be gone, till he's bad, what the hell are you glad I'm the Lord? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, I'm not here, and nothing's likely for me. I drop my gels, drop my gels, for heaven all day long. Now you complain it. Drop my gels, drop my gels, drop my lones, drop my lones. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing I've Got Plenty of Nothin' from Gershwin's Forgy and Bess.
