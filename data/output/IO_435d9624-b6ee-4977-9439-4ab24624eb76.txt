In a few moments, you'll hear the brilliant voices of the Police Glee Club, raised in song here in the Council Chamber in City Hall, and Mr. Whelan is about ready now to inform the Mayor that he has brought another distinguished guest to this great and wonderful building, City Hall. Mr. Whelan. Will you please be in order? The Police Glee Club will open the proceedings with the national anthem. I'll sing you a song, a soldier's song, with chilly rousing chorus, as round our blazing miles we throng, the starry heavens all of us, impatient for the coming fight, while we await the morning's light, till in the silence of the night, we'll chant the soldier's song. So soldiers are we, whose lives are played to Ireland, some have come from a land beyond the way, sworn to be free. No more, our ancient style, and shall shelter the despot or the slave. Tonight we man the barn of will, in Ireland's cause of all the will, mid cannons' roar and rifles' fill, we'll chant the soldier's song. Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hail at the twilight's last night. Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hail at the twilight's last night. Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming. O'er the ramparts we watched, was so gallantly streaming?

being a welcome Intended to Be conveyed To the Irish people It has been my privilege To be here In the United States When the Republic of Ireland Act came into operation I felt That there were so many bonds Of blood And of friendship Between the people Of Ireland And the people Of the United States That it was only right I should be here On this occasion To tell the people Of the United States Of the position Of our country Quite apart From the great many ties Of blood And friendship That exist Between our two nations Probably greater ties Than exist between Any other two nations In the world We have a common tradition That is the people Of the United States And the people of Ireland Have a common tradition Of fighting for liberty And for justice We first established The Republic In Ireland As far back as 1798 That Republic Was established Then By Presbyterians From Belfast In our generation It was again Proclaimed in arms In 1916 So that The coming into operation The Republic of Ireland Act Was not in effect For the first time Establishing The Republic of Ireland That had been done before It was merely securing International recognition For the Republic Mr. Mayor Has Referred Very kindly To the fact That we Have not yet Reached Our ultimate goal Our claim Is a very simple one We assert That the form Of government In Ireland Is a matter For the Irish people Without any Outside interference We claim As much right To select Our government And conduct Our affairs As any other Free nation That is A fundamental Democratic right Is the fundamental Democratic right Upon which Most other Democratic rights Rest The right To national Self-determination No country In the world Has more Clearly defined Boundaries A more distinct National history Or a more Homogeneous Population Denial of And we claim That Britain's Interference In our affairs Britain's occupation Of a portion Of our country Is a denial Of ordinary Democratic rights I hope And I trust That that cannot Long survive In the theorem That in the Democratic world That on this Side of the Iron curtain At least It should be Recognized By all Freedom-loving Nations That the Irish nation And the Irish people Are as Entitled To the Exercise Of democratic Rights As any other Nation Again I want To thank you Mr. Mayor Mr. Will And you Ladies and Gentlemen Who did me The honor Of coming here For the
