It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the Chief Executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The Lone Ranger. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gaspary. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Skerney of Genoa during his visit here to scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished for so distinguished a visitor. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy, but throughout the world, expressed to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor, Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it's with profound commotion that I've heard your words affectionate and cordiales revolting to my modest person and revolting to the noble city that I have here the honor of represent.

For this, Onorevole Impeliteri, we are grateful for her, because she was a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, and so every citizen of the American, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come to the city's high level representative. So, this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Onorevole Impeliteri.

So today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocination of democracy and have operated intelligently because it is to defend the democracy in Europe and in all the world.

And he went to the river and searched the river, and searched the river, and searched the river, and searched the river, that he wanted to find for everyone to join the Christian cross. And then, it doesn't matter if he then found the river, it doesn't matter if each one of us finds the river, it will find the path. The path to the world is free, in peace and in the work. Thank you.

Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts indeed, which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genovese, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us. You were greeted by all of us as a representative of democracy, which is all its possibilities, which is with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome.
