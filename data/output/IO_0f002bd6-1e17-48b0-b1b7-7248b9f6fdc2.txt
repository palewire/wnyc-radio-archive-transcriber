Oh, I've got plenty of nothing and nothing's plenty for me. I got no car, got no mule, got no misery. The folks with dead people, they need to be. Got a lock on the door. Great somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in war. What for, what for? I got a lock on the door, that's the way to be. They can see the cross on the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the sky, are all free. Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's ready for me. I got my gal, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I got my gal, got my lord, got my song. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, got my gal. I got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, got my gal. God will pray all the days Keep the plenty, you don't have to worry I keep the devil away Away, away I am a friend of hell In a time to ride Never want me long as I'm well Never want to strive to be gone, to be bad What the hell are you glad I'm the Lord? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I've got my gals For heaven all day long Now you complain it I've got my gals I've got my gals I've got my Lord I've got my Lord You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing I've got plenty of nothing From Gershwin's Poggy and Bess The choristers are under the direction of Florence Marderosian With Isabel Libore as piano accompanist Still a little girlria Kiss me Cause I'm so scared Love me Love me Love me destiny Love me Love me Love you Love me Love me Love you Love me Love me Love you Thank you.
