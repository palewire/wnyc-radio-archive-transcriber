The Lone Ranger versろ? The Lone Ranger. The Lone Ranger. The Lone Ranger. We are waiting first to wish to love ourselves. Let us return. Let us Cindy. When we are now... ... the day yet I am. We can take this opportunity when we embrace it. Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scurney of Genoa, during his visit here, the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the Mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it's with profound commotion that I've heard your words affectionate and cordial about my modest person and about the noble city that I've been here to represent. We have an exciting thing when you see the people there are no facts and act that he may come to do and every act that man some ultimate Janelle will do but there are no הא� that have a particular meaning. So when you see the Lord in Ooo Honorable Impeleteri is come to come to be in Europe and to come to get my city he's done it un serb Alberta not did we do only a visit ofwan's a god courier She has also raised homage to the mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent to the recognized by the genovese population so connected to the land of America. But she, especially on the impenitere, is also been to Genova ambassador of democracy. That is so expensive to the United States, but so expensive to the Italians and the Genovese, especially. For this, on the impenitere, we are grateful for her, because she was a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, so that every American citizen, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been to come to the city, as she has been to the high level representative of the city. So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of the courtesia, on the impenitere. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and its own and its own, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is the salute of the United States and the great people of the United States, which we are deeply grateful for the United States, which we are deeply grateful for, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to do for us to give us democratic libertarian libertarian libertarian libertarian libertarian libertarian when we have intervened so potentemente in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men, so that today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the sovereign sovereign libertarian bipartisan choice, Because democratic freedom is really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. Our challenge is not easy. For sometimes we don't understand it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy was just when we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We were lost in the city of Città, territory in which our work could be exploited, misery and ruin, but the force, the faith democratic democratic was so alive that we had taken care of our work. We have worked, we are working, we are working, we are working for our country to rebuild our country. It is with these sentiments, onorevole Imperiteri, that I salute you and the city of New York and I say that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in searching for your land is an example to all the genoveses. And this man, dernis' into living and criticalセijkeitas,�데at step step, decreased andødness of Christ, And he remainedczyтовous life and the nation even with whatever isn't enough for our land.

Ebbene, non importa se lui poi non ha trovato il passaggio, non importa se ognuno di noi non trova il passaggio, bisogna persistere, altri troverà la strada, la strada perché tutto il mondo sia libero in pace e nel lavoro. Grazie. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which mean so much to us and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. It's an old Italian phrase. La la la la la, la la la la la la, it's an old Italian phrase.
