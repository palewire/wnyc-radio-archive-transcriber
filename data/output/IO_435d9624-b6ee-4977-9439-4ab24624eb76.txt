Everybody seems happy and bright like the day itself, and well, it's a great day for the Irish and it's a great day for history, because when the little people emerge, there's nothing to worry about. In a few moments, you'll hear the brilliant voices of the Police Glee Club, raised in song here in the Council Chamber in City Hall, and Mr. Whelan is about ready now to inform the Mayor that he has brought another distinguished guest to this great and wonderful building, City Hall. Mr. Whelan. Will you please be in order? The Police Glee Club will open the proceedings with the national anthem. I'll sing you a song, a soldier's song, with chilly rousing chorus, as round our blazing miles we throng, the starry heavens all of us, impatient for the coming fight, while we await the morning's light, till in the silence of the night, we'll chant the soldier's song. So soldiers are we, whose lives are played to Ireland. Some have come from a land beyond the way, sworn to be free. The Lord, our ancient style, and shall shelter the despot or the slave. Tonight we man the barn of will, in air in scores of the foe of will, with cannons roar and rifles the stars will chant the soldier's song. the widow's song. Fifth chord Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early alot. Oh, say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight All the ramparts we watched Was so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air It proved through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled And our yet wave O'er the land of the free And the home of the brave And now, Mr. Whalen Will make the introductions The mayor of the city of New York Is receiving the foreign minister Of the Irish Republic The Honorable Seen McBride

and gentlemen Who have come here To take part in this official welcome To the minister for foreign affairs Of the Republic of Erie Grover As I see it I regret To say that There is not a Republic of

Mayor Mr. Whale I cannot express Or find adequate words To express the gratitude That I feel For the welcome You have given me Today here I will take this welcome As being a welcome Intended to Be conveyed To the Irish people It has been my privilege To be here In the United States When the Republic of Ireland Act came into operation I felt That there were so many Bonds Of blood And of friendship Between the people Of Ireland And the people Of the United States That it was only right I should be here On this occasion To tell the people Of the United States Of the position Of our country Quite apart From the great many ties Of blood And friendship That exist Between our two nations Probably greater ties Than exist Between any other Two nations In the world We have a common Tradition That is the people Of the United States And the people Of Ireland Have a common tradition Of fighting For liberty And for justice We first established The Republic In Ireland As far back As 1798 That Republic Was established Then By Presbyterians From Belfast In our generation It was again Proclaimed in arms In 1916 So that The coming Into operation The Republic Of Ireland Act Was not in effect For the first time Establishing The Republic In Ireland That had been done Before It was merely Securing International Recognition For the Republic Mr. Mayor Has Referred Very kindly To the fact That we Have not yet Reached Our ultimate goal Our claim Is a very simple One We assert That the form Of government In Ireland Is a matter For the Irish People Without any Outside interference We claim As much Right To select Our government And conduct Our affairs As any Other free Nation That is A fundamental Democratic Right Is the Fundamental Democratic Right Upon which Most other Democratic Rights Rest The right To nationals After determination No country In the world Has more Clearly defined Boundaries A more distinct National history Or a more Homogeneous Population Denial And we Claim That Britain's Interference In our affairs Britain's Occupation Of a portion Of our country Is a denial Of ordinary Democratic Rights I hope And I trust That that Cannot long Survive in the Terror That in the Democratic World That on this Side of the Iron Cotton At least It should Be recognized By all Freedom-loving Nations That the Irish nation And the Irish people Are as Entitled To the Exercise Of democratic Rights As any Other nation Again I want to Thank you Mr. Mayor Mr. Will And you Ladies and Gentlemen Who did Me the Honour Of coming Here For the Welcome You have Given To me I take That welcome On behalf Of the Irish people And the Irish government I would like To convey On behalf Of the Irish people And the Irish government Our very Best wishes To you Mr. Mayor And

their Achievement Here We have A common Heritage Between Us And we Hope That we Will Both Remain Faithful And that The Parts Of our Two Great Nations Will Come Ever Closer Together Thank You Very Much Mr. Mayor We have Just heard The reply Of Sean McBride Foreign Minister Of the Republic Of Ireland And the Mayor Of the City Of New York And now Mr. Whelan Hasn't Announcement Mr. Whelan We will Conclude The program With a Few numbers By the Police Glee Club And if The Glee Club Knows What They're About Today The Police Glee Club They'll Do It Better Than They've Ever Done It Before Because

Now, Mr. Whelan. Thank you. Thank you. of the police glee club. From the approval of the commander in chief of the police department of the great city of New York, I'm sure there will be no transfers of the glee club to City Island today. Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you will remain seated while the minister of external affairs and his honor, the mayor leaves the room. In a wonderful spirit of appropriate camaraderie, the foreign minister of the Republic of Ireland, Sean McBride, has been received here today by our own Irishman, William O'Dwyer, born in the ancient land of Ireland that needs apologize to no nation for its cultural values or the struggle it has carried on through the centuries for the enthronement of liberty, life, and the pursuit of happiness. And now, smiling happily, benignly happy, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, mayor of the city of New York, escorts his Irish guests down the aisle of the council chamber of City Hall, and to the splendid and wonderful music of the police glee club we've had epitomized here for us today in music, the feelings that every New Yorker has had for this great and wonderful day. The Republic of Ireland, just being internationally acknowledged since as of Easter Sunday just a few weeks back, finds a quick reflection here in the history of the world in this reception at City Hall. And so it has been in the past and will be in the future. New York City loves to acknowledge accomplishment, especially that that concerns itself with the liberty of all people and the freedom and happiness to pursue life as we see fit for the good of all, for the glorification of all, in the name of God and all the intentions of the spiritual aspects of life itself. And so, from City Hall, we conclude the reception to the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Ireland, the Honorable Shane McBride. And now the mayor is conducting his guests down to the steps at City Hall, and we'll adjourn now to the City Hall steps, although I believe this concludes the radio broadcast part of the ceremony. We return you now to the studios. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System. Thank you.
