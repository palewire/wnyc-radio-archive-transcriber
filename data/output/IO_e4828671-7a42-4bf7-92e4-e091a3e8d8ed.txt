Good morning ladies and gentlemen, we're speaking to you from LaGuardia Field Municipal Airport, the city of New York, where we are awaiting momentarily the arrival of the C-54 transport plane, which will bring General Dwight D. Eisenhower to the greatest of cities. There has been some delay, obviously because of poor weather conditions between here and Washington, but we have everything in readiness for his arrival. As a matter of fact, a few C-54 planes came in, and of course everybody around would start to wonder whether or not that was the plane which was bearing the famous General. We do have time to tell you that all plans as arranged will go on since the weather. While it is a dark day and one which is threatening weather, we are assured that there will not be rain, and so if you want to see the General, you still have plenty of time to get out along the long route and see him. When he does arrive here, of course, there will be ceremonies which we'll describe for you. The General will then head a 25-car motorcade, which will go along Grand Central Parkway here in Queens, across Triborough Bridge, and to Manhattan at 122nd Street. The Cortez will then proceed south on the East River Drive to 96th Street, then went to 5th Avenue, north to 102nd Street, and into Central Park. It will go north on the park's East Drive to the 103rd Street Cross Drive, then west to the West Drive, south to 72nd Street, and across the park to the East Drive, south to 5th Avenue, emerging at 60th Street. Then, of course, it will go down south on 5th Avenue to 23rd Street, switching over to Broadway, and down Broadway to 14th Street, east to the East River Drive, and south to South Ferry, then north on Broadway to City Hall. The ceremonies at City Hall are expected to handle about 40,000 persons. General Eisenhower will speak there, and Mayor Ligotti, who is attendant here, will present a special gold medal, which was struck for this occasion as a gift from this city. And incidentally, we might mention that this medal was struck off in record time. The official party is expected to leave City Hall about 12.40, which would make it about 10 minutes late, and head for the mayor's home, which is Gracie Mansion in Carl Schertz Park. There, the mayor will be host to a private luncheon for the general. And that trip is expected to take about 45 minutes. We can tell you that the police arrangements leaving here at Ligotti Field to New York City will find them proceeding at a speed of 35 miles an hour. When they hit New York City, they will move at a pace of 20 miles per hour, and upon emerging from Central Park, will hit parade speed, which is 2 miles per hour. In the event that you're unable to get a look at this cortege, which will be moving to City Hall, you may have the opportunity of getting a look at it as it moves from City Hall to Gracie Mansion. That cortege will move north on Center Street to Lafayette and Spring Streets, then north on Lafayette to 4th Street, west to Washington Square, through the Washington Arch, and north on 5th Avenue to 23rd Street. Then west to 7th Avenue, north to Broadway at 43rd Street, then to 86th Street, and east on 86th Street, and through Central Park on the transverse road to 5th Avenue and 85th Street. North to 86th Street, east to East End Avenue, and north to Gracie Mansion. And of course, at 2.30, when the luncheon is over, General Eisenhower hopes to head to the Polar Grounds to see the baseball game between the New York Giants and the Boston Braves. And that route will be west to 1st Avenue, north to 116th Street, west to 7th Avenue, north to 151st Street, west to 8th Avenue, north to the Polar Grounds, and into the Polar Grounds. Of course, we can well appreciate that since the General has been overseas for so long, and he himself, as American as baseball, wants to see the great national pastime. The plans, which had been originally set up in case the weather was bad and rainy, are being completely disregarded now since we have the assurance that the weather will hold out. It is not a clear, sunshiny day. It has been threatening rain all morning. As a matter of fact, some three hours ago when we passed Ligartia Field, the sun was coming out intermittently, and it did look as if we might have a very strong shower. However, that has blown by, and while it is dark, it is cool, there's a crowd here lining the upper and lower boardwalks, which is about five deep, and thousands of American schoolchildren have American flags in their hands and are all set and ready to yell and wave as only they can when the General's plane reaches this field. We expect that in this party there will be three C-54 transport planes. Directly in front of the administration building is a huge platform which has been erected solely for the benefit of the photographers and for the greeting party. And out there at the moment, rather nervously, and perhaps as only he so energetically can do it, is the mayor, and he's walking around with that familiar big sombrero which he wears. Grover Whalen, who is acting with and for the mayor in greeting the General, is also out there, and they're all waiting for this moment when this plane will arrive. To the northern part of the field, there is a C-54 transport plane which is pulled in, loaded with cargo, and that has been sidetracked so that we do expect the General's plane to arrive here momentarily. Perhaps a word picture of the way we are strung out here. On field at the present moment is the Fort J Band, and the escort, the Guard of Honor, will be the 716th Military Police Battalion, and they are quartered at 4650 Broadway with Lieutenant Colonel Jack Williams commanding. They went through a few gyrations here and are now at parade rest, all lined up with a Fort J Band, and as each plane flies overhead, despite the fact that in many cases it may be just a one-motor plane, everybody, the youngsters especially, seem to think that it might be a C-54. The field has 25 cars set up here in a motorcade. The first line is five cars, the second 10 and the third 10. To the southern part of the field and to the right of hangar number one is a complete motorcycle escort for the official party, and there are exactly 100 motorcycles. In the official greeting party will be Mayor LaGuardia, Mr. Whalen, Lieutenant General Grunet, who heads the Eastern Defense Command, Vice Admiral Leary, who is the Eastern Sea Frontier Commander, Major General Terry, the head of the Second Service Command, Rear Admiral Kelly, the commander of the 3rd Naval Division, Major General Groninger of the New York Port of Embarkation, and Major General Francis O'Driscoll, the commanding general of the 1st Air Force fighter groups, and you'll remember that he headed to the 8th Air Force in Europe under Eisenhower, so that he especially here is anxious to greet his former commanding general. We are to the right of the administration building on a ramp which leads from the upper boardwalk, as are all other stations which are originating this broadcast. Directly below us and running far to our right are scores of military police. They are stationed here to prevent the crowds from breaking out, rushing on the field. The runway is the number one runway, and we have three dismounting ladders so that if the plane stops at any near any one of them, they can rapidly be moved into position so that there will be no delay in getting General Eisenhower and his group from the plane. Well, every time that they see a play, they think it is a C-54, and now here do come a group through the gray. The gray miss. We can see three huge planes, and they are C-54s. You probably can hear in the background the yells from the youngsters who are screaming, and we understand that these planes will circle the field and then come in for a landing, and they are four-motored C-54 transport planes. One has a tremendous lead, and so we expect that General Eisenhower will land in about five minutes. The guard of honor is in position. The band is in position. They will move from directly in front of us right to the dismounting ladder, and you can hear this huge transport plane as it cuts around, goes over the field, and moves in, and here come two more which are at least a mile behind, and they are separated by about a quarter of a mile. Four army cars and two navy cars are to our right, and they, of course, are the welcoming generals which we've indicated will be Generals Grunet, Terry, and Groninger, and Hunter, and two navy cars which have Admiral Leary and Admiral Kelly. Things become quite silent again as these planes go to the south, and we can tell you that a huge group of Red Cross workers are here, and they have a huge sign, each one carrying a letter to the right of us. It spells out welcome, and to the left of us it spells out home. Welcome home to General Eisenhower. Everything here is in complete readiness for any eventuality. We have ambulances, crash cars parked just in case anything goes wrong and nobody is taking any chances. To the western side of ramp number one are three saluting guns, and there gun crews are stationed there waiting to see in the moment that these planes will land why you will hear the reverberations in the background. Planes are lined up to the far side of the field. There's one yellow Piper, a Thunderbolt fighter, a single fighter, an Army gyroplane which blew up loads of dust before it finally settled and practically drove the gun crews from their positions. It's landed directly alongside of them. The planes have now disappeared into this mist and we can tell you that LaGuardia Field is situated to the eastern end of Queens County in New York City. We're bordering Flushing Bay which is used for amphibious and seagoing planes to take off. To the direct north is Long Island Sound and of course the man-made island which is in the center out there. We're waiting now to see if we can spot these planes and here comes a plane in and out of the mist. We'll keep our eyes on it. It's dropping now. It's about 500 feet and he's coming in to make a landing on the far ramp which is the spot where the C-54 transport with cargo is stationed and we spoke to that about and now here is one plane coming in. It is a C-54 a four-motor plane. The other two planes have disappeared in the darkness. And we don't know whether or not this may be the general. There doesn't seem to be any great indication and we're looking for the numbers 9-1-1 on the tail of the plane which indicate that it is General Eisenhower's plane and that of course is the same plane which made history by taking President Roosevelt to Yalta and back. An air of expectancy is running through the officials who are awaiting the general and as each plane nears why the police just keep rushing out to the front get the people away and make sure there is no interference. The motorcycle police apparently expect the plane to land at any moment because they have gone to their motorcycles and are stationed there. The weather is perhaps an excellent day for a parade because it is not too bright not too hot not too humid but it is dark and it is cool at any rate it is cool here out at LaGuardia Field. The police two hours ago cleared Grand Central Parkway and were preparing to shunt traffic and about every 100 feet there was a police officer. We understand that just about two-thirds of the entire police department has been called out to supervise the parade for General Eisenhower. Now another C-54 transport plane is pulling in and we still are awaiting that third one but apparently none of these planes at the moment are bringing General Eisenhower. One thing which particularly made a great impression upon us was the policing out here they're very strict certain areas are set off and there's been no great effort at regimentation. We noticed rather oddly too that not only are the policemen out in force but the police women are here in force and not only is the army represented here by the enlisted men and of course officers but also many WACs stationed here at LaGuardia Field are out to get a quick look at the General. And here comes another C-54 plane the third of the group that we thought were coming in and here comes one plane down now it's pulling in with two motors cut out and two going and he is being shunted off he's not going to come up this way he's going up a side ramp. First plane is taxiing off to the side and the third plane has landed and possibly that might be the one and we certainly hope there's another one which is now coming in a fourth plane will also come in a C-54 transport a fourth one is just emerging from the dusk and setting down to land and it's amazing how they come out of this what apparently is a gray mist over Long Island Sound and how quickly it can emerge and when it does emerge it's about 300 feet above the water and that plane is now coming in and will hit the far end of the ramp now four of them have three of them have landed four are coming in two are on the field and you may be sure there's a great deal of confusion as to just which one is General Eisenhower's plane and now another one is coming in a fifth C-54 comes out of the murkiness and the second of the five planes is being sent to the side let's see one is being wheeled around and this looks as if it may be that the plane has made a complete circle of the field rolling and it is being led in by a small tractor the kind that usually haul them out and this may be General Ike coming in now the plane has made a complete circle and is pulling in it is taxiing in two motors cut out one moving up and it's a Douglas C-54 and this is it there's the 911 the familiar number and the name of the plane is the Sunflower and it is being flagged in by one of the ATC men it's the number is 4911 it has a red symbol with five planes on it it is now taxiing up to the dismounting ladder and you can be sure that it will be a terrific roar as General Eisenhower steps out of this plane there's the plane cutting out it's other motors the door is opened and the dismounting ladder is being moved out and we're waiting to see whether or not the General will emerge first we imagine that it will that he will plane was 16 minutes late in getting in and the General is standing there in the doorway Ligardi is standing on the inner border of the line and here he comes and there's the roar that goes up from the crowd there's the shots in the background the salute two of them two of them three of them the salutes for General Eisenhower who has just arrived in New York City and there is the General shaking hands vigorously all around introducing his aides Captain Harry Butcher of the Navy and you can hear in the background that the salute are still going off and the third plane is being wheeled around and here comes the General from the plane the General a very robust figure with his chest really puffed out walking energetically with the Mayor and finally the Mayor faces the military police battalion and the Fort J Band and the General is looking over this way he's flanked on the left by Admiral Leary on the right by Lieutenant General Grunet and he is standing alongside of Mayor LaGuardia and the band strikes up and plays the Star Spangled Banner it is Ruffles and Flourishes and we assume that they will break into the Star Spangled Banner the photographers of Army and Navy news services are taking pictures of the General and he stands at attention with the Mayor taking his hat off holding it on his chest and we've just heard Ruffles and Flourishes by the Fort J Band the military police are now at attention the band plays the General walks past them with Colonel Williams who leads the military police and the band now is playing the General's March and the General Generalized now walks past them takes a good look at them he is dressed in suntans not in any battle jacket which he had a great hand in devising and he salutes the stars and stripes and the flag of the city of New York very smartly looks them over tells commanding General Luton here's another cheer for him the General really looks them over he's marched completely around them he's going now towards the back of them and he is engaged in earnest conversation with Colonel Jack Williams who heads the military police and now he's moving to the far side which is towards the ramp from which he has just arrived the four planes have brought the officers and men of General Eisenhower in the enlisted men are going by and one of them is Mickey McKeel who lives practically a stone's throw from here at LaGuardia Field he lives in Corona which is just about one half mile south of LaGuardia Field and the General still takes a look and there's a whole barrage of photographers in front of him as he goes around and now he is being led over he stops for just a brief moment he stops for a brief moment to talk with General Grunner and now he is being led by Mayor LaGuardia and he has a grin on his face just a mile wide the famous Eisenhower grin and he stops for a moment introduces some of his officers to those of the commanding generals of this the Second Service Command the Eastern Defense Command and Captain Harry Butcher is being introduced to Mayor LaGuardia he is the naval aide of General Eisenhower and the General in true American fashion he is so excited and so nervous that he pulls out a cigarette and lights it up and now the photographers move in to take snapshots often there's a crowd here at LaGuardia Field of about 15,000 one hour ago it had been up to 10,000 but they were pouring in there were five deep they're much deeper than that and of course there's a huge number of them on the lower ramp the military police that are stationed here at LaGuardia Field are forming along the inner ridge of the ramp getting a look at the General he is completely smothered now by photographers and newspaper men who are around him and as all of his men surrounding him all his officers are surrounding him and the men who came in on the second, third and fourth planes have gone to the cars in the motorcade each of them has a ticket which tells him what car he's in what seat he's in in the car I'd like to remind you that our coverage will also include spots in New York as this motorcade moves down to City Hall LaGuardia is introducing his aide Jim Hawken to the General the General salutes to him offhand fashion he's standing there that big smile on his face he's well tanned and again the photographers are just snapping that famous Eisenhower smile as he stands there's no doubt that the General is pleasingly embarrassed at this tremendous reception which he has received there's a huge number of military personnel here a major comes over he wants some more of these military police out there because the crowd which is getting out around Eisenhower is a bit unmanageable and the motorcade is getting ready to take General Eisenhower to New York City where the major portion of the reception will be made at City Hall so if you are along the route of travel and would like to see General Eisenhower you certainly have plenty of time to get there and to see him America's great hero who was commanding general in the European Theater of Operations the highest honor that any American general has ever had and certainly his operation in Europe the invasion the greatest military operation of all time June you know has been a lucky month for Eisenhower he graduated 30 years ago from West Point and it was three years ago that he was given the assignment as commanding general in the European Theater of Operations it was June 1944 that saw him invade successfully Europe and it was June that sees him now return home he's a Texan by birth he's lived in Kansas but New York City has taken him to its heart and today he has invaded New York City he's captured the place without a shot being fired and everybody just willingly capitulating to him he's now going to the car the motorcycles have started up and the millions of people in New York City in just a few moments will be able to see him he's now climbing into the car he and the mayor will be in car number one and in car number two will be General Walter Bedell Smith and Grover Whalen in car three will be Admiral Kirk and the Honorable C.R. Beasley Car number four will be Major General Harold Bull and Major General Littlejohn and in car five Major General Schlater and General Thomas Davis and here is car number one and a soldier runs out and shakes the General's hand the General shakes it very vigorously the car has the New York City emblem on the left in the front also has the New York City flag on the left the General smiles and waves they ask him to wave he does he waves he smiles and that grin hasn't left his face from that moment when he so nervously stepped from the C-54 plane which is ready to be towed away on the right side of the car is a red flag with five silver stars on it and again the photographers swarm in on top of the General and some of the men in attendance here have gone over and shaken hands with the General and he very energetically shakes hands with him he shakes hands as if he means it and he does of course they're keeping everybody away from him now the motorcycles are starting to move away the car is moving away it circles around it heads now for New York City over the Triborough Bridge and that's just about all that there is from here at LaGuardia Field and they're all lined up now the cars are pulling out and General Eisenhower is on his way to New York City that's all from LaGuardia Field we return you to our studios our next point of vantage in the parade on this historic General Light day will be 5th Avenue at 60th Street which we'll bring you just as soon as we can now meantime we'll have the BBC morning special at 10.30 for you until that time here is some recorded music appropriate for the day clear clear contact contact off we go into the wild blue yonder climbing high into the sun here they come zooming to meet our thunder Adam boys give us a grunt down we dive spouting our planes from under off with one terrible roar we live in fame walker down in flame nothing will stop the Army Air Corps here's a toast to the host of those who love the past and love us high to a friend we will send the message of his brother men will cry we drink to those who gave them all a boat then down we rode before the rain was hot a golden toast and the host of men we boat the Army Air Corps has not heard a trip as as as the here it TV The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End
