Good morning ladies and gentlemen. It is now my honor and privilege to introduce to you and present to you the Police Commissioner Thomas F. Murphy. Mr. Mayor, Reverend clergy, Deputy and Honorary Police Commissioners, distinguished guests, members of the force, your families and friends. This is a very happy occasion for me and I'm sure it is for all of us. The last time I was here, I had a sad task to perform. Now, for the first time, it's my privilege to promote a large group of men affecting all ranks in the department. Almost all of you men, I am meeting for the first time. Although I haven't made your acquaintance personally, I can assure you that I have acquainted myself thoroughly with your record of service in the department. The men above the competitive civil service ranks and the detectives, being advanced in grade, the men above the middle of the country have received special scrutiny. The other to the third time, I nowоротky, two men are elected on the basis, and the badge ofcom- Ripley. Thisopolitical principle means that those two mijnfrescoeder can be saved in the morning. They haveaudioeleven en Kronenck был in when he gave me the job, his personal assurances that the job was mine with no strings attached and that I should promote men only on a merit basis. His honor has further demonstrated his interest in our work and the welfare of the entire department. By his presence here this morning, I'm sure, had a personal sacrifice. Our promotion to higher rank carries with it added responsibility. The eyes of the people of this city, indeed the entire country, are and will be focused upon you. And you can be assured that those eyes will include my own. A man can hope to evade his responsibility and retain his rank. Now, the high reputation of the department, we all know, has suffered greatly because of the disloyalty of a few. It must and will be restored to its rightful position and regain the confidence of the people of the city. In addition, we must adopt such a policy and a method or procedure that makes it impossible for any disloyal man to ever again bring opprobrium to this great force. I am asking you as honestly and sincerely. I need your cooperation. And from what I have already experienced, I am sure and confident that I will receive it. And now the chief inspector will read the names of the men to be promoted. Conrad H. Rothengast. Conrad H. Rothengast. Conrad H. Rothengast. Conrad H. Rothengast. Conrad H. Rothengast. Conrad H.

Commissioner Murphy, Deputy Commissioners, particularly the men who have been promoted today, and their many, many friends, and of course, the members of their family who are here to witness these proceedings today. I think this ceremony today is a perfect answer to some people who don't think things out in the right attitude. This is a demonstration of the fact that New York City has the finest police force in the entire world. That's one of the few nice things about this campaign. I don't think that any candidate has disagreed with what I have just said. I even appeared on the platform on one of these tours with the governor of the state of New York, and he said publicly on that occasion that the members of the police force, in his judgment, and he said he spoke with knowledge because his connection with the police department went back a great number of years, were the finest body of men serving the public in the entire world. Of course, it's not necessary for me to repeat my thinking because my association with the police department goes back for a period of some 21 years, both as an assistant district attorney and in the various other positions I've held in public life, and particularly during the last five years as president of the city council and as acting mayor. I have repeatedly held to the position that we have an excellent police force. Of course, policemen are no different than other mortals, and that applies to all levels of people that live in this world that we know. And ultimately, we find a man who doesn't measure up. And when that happens, it necessarily reflects upon other people who are dead on the level. So that when things like that happen, all we can do is to see to it that the morale of the department, the confidence of the department, the confidence of the public, is led along the right path, and that is to know that by far and large, practically all of the members of the police department are A number one honest, decent, conscientious police officers doing a job for the city, doing a job for themselves, and doing a job for the morale of the police department itself. As police commissioner Murphy pointed out, some few weeks ago, there was evidence around the city of New York that the people had lost some degree of confidence in the police department. We were disturbed about it. When that happened, I looked around the city of New York for a man whom I believed to be the outstanding man to head up this department. I had a conference with that gentleman long before any candidates decided that he was the right man. Two or three days after I conferred with your present police commissioner, two or three of the candidates said that he'd be a good man. But that came out after I had already conferred with Commissioner Murphy and after Commissioner Murphy, after thinking it over, decided to accept the job. Commissioner Murphy told you that when he agreed to take the job, I told him that I was appointing him without any strings attached whatsoever. He didn't come from any political club. He came only from what I considered to be the judgment of the people of the city of New York. The people demanded that we have as the head of the police department an honorable, courageous, vigorous man who enjoyed the confidence of the public. And I have found out since I asked Tom Murphy to raise his hand that the confidence in the police department today has been restored 100%. I might say to you that I don't know of a single newspaper in the city of New York, no matter what their shade of political thinking is, that has not commended editorially the appointment of your police commissioner. And that's very nice. It's very nice to know. I might also tell you that both the police commissioner and myself have received hundreds upon hundreds of letters demonstrating the fact that the people have the utmost confidence in his leadership of your force. That has tremendous significance. It's important to me as the mayor of the city of New York. It's important to you as members of the police department. It's important to your families. And it's important to all the people of the city of New York to know that we have an excellent police force, that that police force enjoys the confidence of the public. And in addition to that, to know that this department today is led by the type of man that you saw here today swearing in all of these promotions. I'm very happy to be here. I'm very happy to join in these ceremonies. I'm very happy to note that all of these promotions were made by the police commissioner on the basis of merit and merit alone. I'm 100% for exactly that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Commissioner Murphy, I want you to know that that's exactly the way I want the police department to be operated. I want you to know that while I'm mayor of the city of New York, I will want it that way. I have the utmost confidence in your leadership. I have confidence in the men in your department. If one or two or three or four fall by the wayside for the benefit of all these other fine, decent, hardworking police officers, you have my orders and I know that you share exactly the same feeling I do. You will take care of those. On the other hand, I know that you share with me the feeling that the average New Yorker shares. And that is that we have a wonderful police department and under your leadership, it's going to go forward, forward and forward so that within a very short period of time, everybody will be complimenting your leadership and the men and women who make up this wonderful police force. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm sure that everyone here joins in your remarks and feels exactly the same way. I know it will be an encouragement to the men as it will be to me. And I propose to continue the survey of the entire department. And when men are found who merit promotion, they're going to be promoted. And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you're pleased, the chief inspector will make the various assignments. Thank you again. I want to get a couple of inspectors here. They want to take some pictures. I want to take some pictures. I want to take some pictures. I want to take some pictures. Bring them up. Goldberg, Fox, Gallagher. That's the McDonald. I want to take some pictures.
