Thank you. The history of the city of the city of New York. Many of the men. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The center, the center. Thank you. Its services have been expanded. New services have been added. It is now associated with a medical school. We could almost say that this is a miniature medical center. And as a member of the people of this neighborhood, I want to tell or I want to say to all those who had anything to do with the reopening of the center that the people of this neighborhood are very grateful and that they are well aware of the gift which has been made to them. I have this to say to the people of the neighborhood. A center like this cannot really be a success unless the people of the neighborhood lend it all its cooperation. It is necessary that the people realize the many services of which they can avail themselves in such a center. It is important that they come to this center before it is too late. In this center, we have one of the most progressive institutions today when it comes to such things as curative and preventive medicine in the field of diseases, venereal diseases, in the field of cancer, in the field of tuberculosis and in other medical fields. I therefore wish to express to all our thanks for such a reopening. Thank you. Thank you very much, Dr. Marine. In bringing into being a building of this kind, it is a relatively simple matter for the medical staff of the health department to put on paper the many things which they desire to have in order to function smoothly and effectively in the medical field. It remains, however, for a different department of the city government to bring that building into being. In this respect, the city of New York is extremely fortunate, and I am sure the Department of Health is extremely fortunate, in having associated with it in the city government a Department of Public Works which is keenly alive to the needs of the health department and keenly aware of the function they serve in bringing these needs into being. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to present to you the Commissioner of the Department of Public Works, the Honorable Frederick H. Zermuller. Mr. Chairman Mueller. Dr. Mahoney, Reverend clergy, Mr. Deputy Mayor, Mr. Borough President, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, and children. I particularly stress the children because I know that many of these doctors can talk to you grown-ups better than I can. Somewheres in my reading life, I've read a book by Samuel Butler, and its name was Erwan. Now, if you pronounce or spell that word, you would find that it is the word nowhere spelled backwards. And in that book, he describes a mythical land in which the greatest crime against society in that land was to be in poor health. If you're in poor health. If you didn't take care of your health in Erwan, you were put in jail. And that's one of the reasons why we build these health centers. To be put in jail for being in poor health would be an amusing idea. But it is true that a person who neglects his health, if he has the means and the opportunity to take care of it, is neglecting not only his own best interests, but he is neglecting the interests of his family, the ones whom he holds dear, and also of the society in which he lives. As a result of poor health, he must be absent from work, his income is affected, his family is affected, and the whole society loses the benefit of its productive capacity. Now, this applies particularly in the case of communicable diseases. The interest of society in that case is very obvious. These health centers are preventative medicine, as I understand it. And while I'm an engineer, if I were a doctor, I think my interest would be in preventative medicine. For health centers such as we are dedicating here today are the evidence of the deep concern which your city has as the agent of society in a great metropolis. It is evidence of the great interest the city manifests in the health of its people. Health centers such as this are visible proof that each of us is affected if any of us suffer or can be prevented from suffering. I hope that all you good people will take full advantage of the facilities of this up-to-date health center. There is available here the very latest techniques in preventative medicine so that all who desire them have the opportunity to take care of their health in their own interest and the interest of their society in general. I congratulate the health department on this completion of this center and I have the pleasure of turning over to the deputy mayor at this time the key to the building and that ends our job in the department of public works. Thank you. Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you the deputy mayor of the city, Mr. Charles Horowitz. Commissioner Mahoney, Reverend Clergy, Borough President Wagner, Commissioner Zermuelen, and the other distinguished guests and ladies and gentlemen. Standing here in the shadow of the great James Weldon Johnson Housing Project, which represents one of many thousands of housing units erected by the city of New York for the health, convenience, and comfort of its people, and standing in the shadow also of this great structure, as the official representative of Mayor Vincent Impeletari, I deem it a great pleasure and a privilege to participate with you in the dedication of the enlarged health center, which is being opened here today. I bring you the very warm and personal greetings of Mayor Impeletari and express to you his keen personal regret and his inability to be with you this afternoon. But you may be assured that in spirit he is with you and that he will continue his efforts and renew with vigor the fight that is being made to relieve the conditions in this city that call for the construction of more health centers of this type and character. Commissioner Mahoney has alluded to the fact that in this gathering are many whose place of origin is the great country of Puerto Rico. Today, I bring to you from the far distant shores of Puerto Rico a message of the governor of Puerto Rico, who likewise, I am sure, is with us in spirit today. He writes to Mayor Impeletari as follows. My dear Mayor Impeletari, it is with real interest and pleasure that I learn that the New York City Department of Health is opening its remodeled and greatly enlarged District Health Center in East Harlem at ceremonies on Monday, October 27, 1952. We are interested because we know that this District Health Center service serves the health needs of more than 200,000 persons of whom approximately 70,000 are New Yorkers of Puerto Rican origin. We know that the East Harlem District Health Center gives child health service, tuberculosis services, social hygiene services, health education, nutrition education, and many other services designed to protect and promote the health and well-being of the residents of East Harlem. Certainly, I, as Governor of Puerto Rico, want to urge all of the New Yorkers of Puerto Rican origin who live in this district to take full advantage of the services of your Department of Health and that which it offers and also to urge all of them to cooperate and work with the Department of Health in protecting and promoting the health of themselves and all New Yorkers. I know that the people of Puerto Rico join with me in recognizing the opening of this magnificent District Health Center as but one sign of the enduring friendship and understanding that exists between the people of New York and the people of our island. Cordially yours, Luis Minos Marin, Governor of Puerto Rico. 31 years ago, a program was begun on this site which has grown and spread to every section of our city. In 1921, the East Harlem Health Center was opened here. It was the first of what has become the citywide system of health centers of the Department of Health. Those centers now bring the many services of our Department of Health directly to the people of the city in their own neighborhood. When it was opened, the East Harlem Health Center was described as a pioneer experiment in the development of local cooperation in matters of health involving citizens, voluntary health and welfare organizations and the Department of Health. One of the purposes of that pioneer effort was to measure the value of such cooperation. The value of that program which began here has been tremendous and it is still growing. Since the first health center was opened 30 years ago, we have made tremendous strides in improving and in maintaining the health of the people of our city. Those strides have been made under the guidance and leadership of your Department of Health. The public imagination is caught and held by reports about new wonder drugs such as penicillin and the antibiotics. I would like you to realize that some of the achievements of your health department in the last 30 years have been as dramatic, as striking, as anything achieved by the discovery of any new wonder drug. Let me take just two examples, diphtheria and typhoid. In 1921, the year the East Harlem Health Center was opened, more than 15,000 New York City children were stricken by diphtheria. Almost 900 of them died. So far this year, there have been but 14 cases of diphtheria and exactly one death from that disease. Many of us here are old enough to remember when diphtheria was the most dread scourge of childhood, when every year thousands of children were stricken and hundreds died. Today, and this is largely due to the leadership and work of the Department of Health, diphtheria has been all but eradicated from our city. Now let us talk of typhoid fever. In 1921, 899 persons were hit by that disease. 123 of them died. So far this year, there have been only 82 cases and not a single typhoid death. this disease too has yielded to the constant vigilance and to the never-ceasing work of your Department of Health. I could go on citing achievement after achievement of your Health Department, but there are still big health problems which face our city and our people. Ours was one of the first cities to undertake a systematic fight against tuberculosis. That fight has not yet been won, but the ravages of the disease have been reduced, and this fight, like those against diphtheria and typhoid, will ultimately be won. Our Department of Hospitals, as you know, has played an important part in the development and use of a new drug with which to fight tuberculosis. That helps to bring nearer the day of complete victory over the white plague. When our doctors and scientists eradicate the epidemic diseases, new problems arise. Those problems mainly concern the diseases and afflictions of middle age and later life, such diseases as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Here in this new health center, in addition to all the regular services of the Department, there will be a center detection, a cancer detection prevention center. The cancer detection prevention center here will be one of a chain of such centers throughout the city where all knowledge and skills we have for fighting this disease will be put at the service of the people. This is a magnificent structure designed to be used to meet the new needs of this community of East Harlem. But to me, the heart of the service here lies in the people who work in this building, the doctors and nurses, the sanitarians and laboratory technicians, and all the others with special skills and high devotion to their tasks. For we must always remember that wicked and evil men as well as good and devoted men can build great buildings, it is not the building that matters alone, but the use to which it is put. This building is but a place in which people can work at the high task of saving and guarding life, at the great work of building health. informally opening this new and remodeled East Harlem District Health Center. We dedicate an institution of service, an institution which will serve our people and our way of life. The part of any one of us that we may play might be very small, but the total purpose and the total effect is great. It is your building to be used by you and your servants of the health department to serve great purposes. And in conclusion, I want to take this opportunity of extending the appreciation of Mayor Impeletary and the 8 million people of the city of New York and the congratulations and felicitations to Commissioner Mahoney, to Commissioner Zermuelen, and to all who have participated in the bringing about of this wonderful contribution to the improvement of the health conditions of East Harlem. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Mayor. The next speaker will address in Spanish Reverend Father James McSherry of St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church. Father McSherry. President John Ooooh Thank you very much, when he comes out and goes there to his the President distinguished guests and friends of Harlem.

Commissioner Mahoney, es mi gran privilegio y placer para presentarles a ustedes la key que abrirá el puente a este gran centro que me sé que me sé que le dará un gran gran gran gran gran de la aleviación de los problemas y sufrimos de la gente de la gente de East Harlem y a la gente to Dr. Ayers, who is and will continue, we hope, for a long time to serve as the District Health Officer for East Harlem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I'd like to thank very much the sanitation van for their courtesy. On top.
