We hear first, The Banks of Allen Water, followed by Now is the Month of Maying. On the banks of Allen Water, where the spring springtime may fall, On the millers of the daughters, parents of them all. For the trials of the summer, and the winning can be, On the banks of Allen Water, where the road of the road spread its toll, There is no one of the millers of the daughters, But the times I know more. For the summer, free, and water, And the soldier, folks, not he, On the banks of Allen Water, And the father and sheep. On the banks of Allen Water, where the winter snow fell past, Till the streets of the millers of the daughters, And the children, children, children, children, children, children, children. From the millers of the daughters, From the millers of the daughters, From the millers of the daughters, All from road and careless, From the banks of Allen Water, where the poor slay sheen. From the millers of the daughters, Now in the months of Lennie, When Mary lives of Lennie, The End The End The End The End The Choristers have sung to Madrigals, the banks of Allen Water, and now is the month of May.

The End The End I want to meet my mother I want to meet my mother I want to live with God I want to meet my mother I want to live with God I want to meet my mother I want to meet my mother I want to meet my mother I want to meet my mother I want to meet my mother We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. Soon I will be done. A spiritual is just sung by the choristers. And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Borey, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their kids and their kids, down a lot on the door, pray somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? What for? I've got a lot on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no sun, got no moon, got no people see. I've got plenty of nothing, got no pray all the day. Keep the plenty, don't have to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of life. Never want me long, it's not well. Never want me strive, to be gone, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I do, Lord? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Now you complain it. Got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Beth.
