. . . . . . . . . . . . Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Almighty God, we place ourselves in thy presence here gathered to inaugurate a new and with thy blessing we confidently trust an illustrious phase of the history of this college. In thy presence, we recall with gratitude that the City College, in its founding, was motivated by the generous impulse and noble purpose of those who conceived and established it. So that having successfully pursued the true and the good, they may emerge from the quest, men and women mellowed by wisdom and firm in those basic and universal convictions, without which democracy cannot survive nor civilization endure. Bless the faculty of the City College, that they may always see the student as the focal point of their academic prestige, their accumulated knowledge, and their educational experience. Bless the faculty. Bless the faculty. Bless the faculty. Bless the faculty. Bless the faculty. Bless the faculty. Bless the faculty. Bless the faculty. Bless the faculty. gives testimony in ageless words, the heavens show forth the glory of God and the firmament declareth the work of his hands. Bless almighty God, the new president of the City College, in whose selection from outside our midst has been operative the aspiration implicit in the purpose of the founders, that the sound direction of the education of their sons be assured by wide experience, proven capacity of understanding, and unassailable integrity. May his sound leadership commend itself to faculty and students so that the great potentialities of this college may be fully activated to the end that its total salutary influence under the direction of its president may operate to the advancement, intellectual, spiritual, and physical, of each student, and that the city and nation may be culturally enriched, morally strengthened, and materially benefited in the contribution made to them by those who will have been students of the City College during this new presidency. May this esteemed president be guided always for his personal peace and his public trust by that declaration of divine wisdom recorded in the New Testament. You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. Yes. I wanted to give you a moment to change, and please bring over and move the��itude from the Taiwan Disability ESocial because I was not grateful in the time in my work today.

It is peculiarly fitting that his former chief should be here to help us welcome Dr. Gallagher to the elevation into which we are now about to inaugurate him. The Honorable Earl James McGrath has been a specialist in higher education and in public service in this country and throughout the world for several decades, as the following few examples from the long list of educational and governmental organizations with which he has been associated will illustrate. I shall indulge my desire to name a few. More would embarrass him. War Man Power Commission, Federal Security Agency, US National Commission for UNESCO, Fulvite Board of Foreign Scholarships, the President's Commission on Higher Education, US delegate to the General UNESCO Conference in Paris in 1949. And I could go on and mention 20 other comparable with those services in public service in the most outstanding character. As well, he is a distinguished author of many books and writings in this field. I have the honor to present the Honorable Earl James McGrath, United States Commissioner of Education. of Director of Education and Waterfow Bank � indubitators. ruawan Terry, Dr. Gallagher, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. One of the most significant and enduring traits of our national character is the high degree of confidence which we as a people have traditionally placed in education. The founding fathers of this nation were keenly aware that the well-being of a democracy depends fundamentally upon the enlightenment of its citizens. Colonial statesmen recognizing this important relationship between education and a free society strongly advocated the general dissemination of knowledge among the citizenry. Our first president, in commenting on the relationship between education and political maturity, offered this wise injunction, which is as applicable today as it was some 160 years ago. Promote then, said President Washington, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion, as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened. Thomas Jefferson expressed the same thought in his observation that a healthy democratic society requires a system of general instruction which shall reach every description of our citizens from the richest to the poorest. Few Americans would today dispute the essential soundness of this view. Its practical results can be observed from the earliest days of the republic to the present. As the American educational system is developed, the opportunity for education has been extended to an ever increasing number of American youth. Today, almost all children who are physically and mentally fit complete in elementary education, and 80% of those of the appropriate ages are in high school. One in five attend some kind of institution of higher education. The median number of years of school completed in the group 25 to 29 years of age is 12.1, the equivalent of high school graduation. These are comforting figures supplying as they do quantitative evidence of the flowering of the greatest experiment in mass education the world has ever seen. It would be easy and altogether pleasant. I assure you, if I could join with you in drawing from them the comfortable conclusion that the idealistic objective of the founding fathers, namely, the proper education of all our young people for the responsibilities of citizenship has now been definitively achieved. Tandor forbid such a statement. Let us examine for a moment some of the reasons why. It must be recognized at the outset that during the period in which our unique American educational system was evolving, the rest of our social order was hardly standing in status quo. The past 150 years, and particularly the period since 1900, have witnessed at times a bewildering succession of social developments which have resulted in making American life infinitely more complex than it was earlier in our history. The relatively simple life of rural, more or less self-contained communities has become complex, even for those who continue to live on the farm. And for the majority of our citizens who now live in urban areas, life is even further complicated. Developments in science, technology, health, medicine, international affairs, the organization of private industry, the relations between individuals and their government, all these factors and the multitude of others have increased tremendously the need for knowledge and understanding among our people. The apparent improvement in our general level of education must therefore be weighed in the light of the constantly increasing need for additional education. But demands for other types of education and training, hitherto not offered at all, have also risen. Many types of specialized and technical training designed to prepare young people for specific jobs in industry and commerce have been introduced. Under the impact of these forces, the Liberal Arts College program, of some years ago, composed of a common body of subject matter in a few closely related disciplines, now includes dozens, if not hundreds, of courses of a semi-professional or technical character. Too often, the result of this multiplication of courses is that many young people leave these institutions more adequately prepared to make a good living than a good life. In too many cases, our students have learned only an impressive body of technical information or mastered a set of highly specialized professional skills. They can make anything from sewing machines to skyscrapers. They can fly around the world in three days or destroy thousands of human lives in three seconds. But with the persistent problems of humanity which surround them, they are less well equipped to cope. And unfortunately, many seem little interested in such matters, except when an atomic bomb temporarily shakes their faith in techniques and troubles their conscience about the basic problems of life. They have gained too little in wisdom. They do not understand the world around them, nor do they possess the broad knowledge needed to help in solving its major problems. At least equally influential in shifting the emphasis in our institutions of higher education to highly technical and specialized curricula have been the activities of the scholars themselves. In the early days of this nation, those who progressed beyond the lower grades came into contact with a generally recognized corpus of traditional learning. These intellectual experiences provided a common ground upon which educated men could meet and discuss the problems of their day. Since the late 19th century, however, scholars have typically been concerned with narrower and narrower intellectual pursuits. Knowledge has been broken into smaller and smaller pieces. Institutions of higher education, particularly universities, have increasingly been concerned with the training of specialists in the various subject matter areas, which by a form of mitosis have increased in number until the half dozen major departments of a few decades ago have now risen to 75 or 100. This endless splitting up of the traditional areas of knowledge has resulted in a steady fragmentation of the educational experiences of students, even in the liberal arts colleges, the institutions whose overriding purpose should be better education of young men and women for their common responsibilities of citizenship. I think it is very significant that as long ago as 1867, a man of remarkable foresight and depth of perception, John Stuart Mill, in his own inaugural address at St. Andrews, commented prophetically on the dangers inherent in these developments. He said, He said, Every department of knowledge becomes so loaded with details that one who endeavors to know it with minute accuracy must confine himself to a smaller and smaller portion of the whole. Every science and art must be cut up into subdivisions until each man's portion, the district which he thoroughly knows, bears about the same ratio to the whole range of useful knowledge that the art of putting on a pin's head does to the field of human industry. Now, if in order to know that little completely, it is necessary to remain wholly ignorant of all the rest, what will soon be the worth of a man? If our people are to have the breadth of understanding required to live intelligently in this complex world, certainly those who progress to the upper levels of the educational system must receive a broader general education than is now common. This is not the place to discuss the detailed changes that need to be made in the college curriculum. Suffice it to say that our students, if they are to be well-rounded and effective citizens in this mid-20th century, must achieve an understanding of the main ideas and the intellectual methods in the major areas of knowledge. It is no longer possible for an adult citizen to live intelligently in the contemporary world, for example, without some knowledge of the essential scientific facts, not the specialized data offered in a course in one of the scientific fields suited to the needs of a future PhD, but the general knowledge related to the everyday life of the average citizen. Similarly, in the social disciplines, there is a corpus of significant facts without which citizens cannot understand and cope with the complexities of modern life. Likewise, through the study of the humanistic subjects, students should gain an understanding of the intellectual and moral bases of our free democratic institutions. Surely none of these subjects can be neglected by those who seek to qualify themselves for positions of leadership in a free society. But today, I want to focus attention briefly on a particular indispensable element in the general education program. Our principal problems now arise out of the relations between men and men and between men and their governments. They are problems which deal with human values, as these values are manifested in social institutions. If our citizens are to understand and preserve our free system, they must know the history of mankind's effort to embody these values in the laws, the traditions, the customs, the mores of Western European culture, and more particularly in our own national life. This means, as I understand it, that instruction in the humane disciplines and the social sciences which treat the Judaic Christian tradition and the evolution of our own social institutions must be broadened, vitalized, and made a common element in the education of all college students. Some of our people, and I regret to say even some of those who have had the advantages of higher education, express ideas and exhibit behavior which shows that they do not understand and appreciate the human values upon which our social system rests. In my judgment, the present situation demands an intensified emphasis upon American history and the United States government. The study of our fundamental governing documents, which have determined not only the character of our government, but also the informal relationships among our people, needs to be made an essential part of the experience of every American youth. Now this will require something more than an uninspired and mechanical review of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the other basic charters of our life. It will require a study of the evolution of the ideas in these documents and a review of the human thought, effort, and blood that was spent to establish these principles as the controlling forces in the relationships among men and their governments. Such study will provide the basis for an enlightened consideration of our own social problems in terms of the traditional rights and responsibilities which these documents establish. It will also arm youth ideologically against false doctrines. It should make our people realize that a merely negative attack on the evils of communism is not enough. Young people must be prepared affirmatively to understand, prize, and defend the ideas and the ideals which infuse our democratic life. These conceptions can be made vivid and real through the study of the events of American history and the history of other nations which have contributed to the evolution of free institutions. Acquaintance with the events which occurred at Runnymede over 700 years ago will cause students to realize that on that occasion something more took place than a mere agreement between a king and a group of rebellious subjects. That on that spot, men took firm action in throwing off the yoke of tyranny and thus achieved a measure of freedom to determine their own destiny. Through a study of our revolt against England, students will learn something about the efforts of subject peoples today to achieve the dignity of self-determination as members of this free world. By a study of the events which led up to the emancipation of the slaves during the Civil War, students will appreciate the simple truth that all men have a right to freedom and justice without regard to color or previous condition of servitude. Through such study of the historical incidents which have shaped our national life, young people will gain a clearer understanding of contemporary public issues and the firmest possible defeats against ideologies and practices fundamentally opposed to our own. They will realize that the present conflict is not merely a conflict between one type of economic system and another, but rather that it is a choice between one value system in which the individual is free to determine his own destiny and another in which he is the helpless creature of the state. They will learn that our system embraces and that totalitarianism rejects such basic conceptions as respect to the dignity of the individual, the rights of freedom of speech, assembly, and of worship, the idea that everyone should be free in his actions except when he constitutes a menace to other members of society, the view that men are innocent until proved guilty. The outcome of the present worldwide conflict between totalitarian nations and the free world will determine whether or not these views concerning liberty among men and the nature and destiny of human life shall prevail or be driven from the earth. At this time, when these very values are at stake, it is of crucial importance that young people know the significance of the matters at issue. In the long run, this knowledge is our best defense against subversive philosophies and practices. There are also dangers to our free institutions at home. Every loyal American wants to deal promptly, firmly, and effectively with subversives. Some of our fellow citizens, however, in their eagerness to root out totalitarian influences, are embracing practices closely akin to those employed by the totalitarians themselves. The traditional freedoms enjoyed by our countrymen from the beginning of the republic are now sometimes abridged, perhaps unwittingly, by some of our own people. These persons are either not acquainted with the political and social conceptions which have shaped American society, or they fail to see that some of the devices now being implied are essentially totalitarian. One who observes the American scene thoughtfully cannot fail to be disturbed by present encroachments upon the dignity of the individual and the rights of men to speak their minds freely. If we are to preserve our freedom, we must not tolerate unwarranted attacks on the good name and the character of loyal Americans with total disregard of the damage done to their names, their families, their right to earn a living, and their other rights as men in a free society. Loyal Americans must not be publicly condemned and ostracized without the opportunity of defending themselves before a tribunal of justice. The public platform must not be denied to some of our citizens on the simple grounds that their views do not happen to please other members of the community. Any thoughtful observer of the present situation must realize that if these practices are permitted to go unchallenged in the United States, suspicion, fear, intellectual timidity will result among our people and our very social structure will be undermined. One of our most distinguished jurists, Judd Lerner at hand, has said about these infringements on our freedoms, quote, I believe that that community is already in a process of dissolution where nonconformity with the accepted creed, political as well as religious, is a mark of disaffection, where denunciation, without specification or backing, takes the place of evidence, where orthodoxy chokes freedom of dissent, where faith in the eventual supremacy of reason has become so timid that we dare not enter our convictions in the open lists to win or lose. Such fears as these are a solvent which can eat out the cement that binds the stones together. They may in the end subject us to a despotism as evil as any that we dread, and they can be allayed only insofar as we refuse to proceed on suspicion and trust one another until we have tangible ground for misgiving. The judge continues, the mutual confidence on which all else depends can be maintained only by an open mind and a brave reliance upon free discussion. I do not say that these will suffice. Who knows, but we may be on a slope which leads down to aboriginal savagery. But of this I am sure. If we are to escape, we must not yield a foot upon demanding a fair field and an honest race to all ideas. If present practices which undermine the essential rights in our democratic society are extended, we shall perhaps unconsciously embrace the very totalitarian practices most repugnant to free men and the whole complexion of American society will change. If this condition is to be avoided, one of the most important responsibilities of our educational institutions in the days ahead must be a greater emphasis upon our historic origins, the development of the controlling values in our culture and the responsibilities of citizenship in a free society. To accomplish these objectives will require wise and steady leadership in the administrative officers and the faculties of our colleges and universities. This institution is fortunate to have at its head in these critical days Dr. Buell G. Gallagher. It's been my privilege to know Dr. Gallagher for many years as a fellow worker and as a friend. I know that he has rare, a rare combination of intellectual, emotional, and spiritual qualities which qualify him uniquely for the heavy and exacting responsibilities of the office upon which he now enters. With regard to the two matters I have discussed this afternoon, general education and our free institutions, his thoughts and his acts clearly exhibit his understanding of and his dedication to that broad, humane learning and the principles of human freedom which these institutions must cultivate in our people. He has an arresting intellectual versatility, an intense and abiding love of freedom, and an uncompromising moral courage. More than ever before in the life of this nation these qualities are required in the men and women who occupy high office, public as well as private. Buell Gallagher will discharge his responsibilities as president of City College of the City of New York wisely and well. On this felicitous occasion I congratulate the City College on its selection of Dr. Gallagher for this high office and to him I extend warm personal greetings and best wishes.
