Mr. Chairman, Your Eminence, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen, the people of the United States are proud that the United Nations has chosen our country for the location of its permanent headquarters. We are grateful for the confidence in us that was implicit in that decision, and we are resolved in all ways to meet the special responsibilities it imposes upon our country. This site, on the banks of the East River in the city of New York, will become the geographical center of the world, the home of the one institution through which the greatest hopes of all mankind can be fulfilled, the hopes of lasting peace and brotherhood of all people. This site is perfectly situated to be the center and symbol of these hopes. Here is the greatest seaport on the American continent. Ships bearing the people of every race and the products of every country traverse these waters. Just across the river are the great airports that may be reached by travelers in a few hours from any part of the world. Within a few blocks is the biggest railway permanence of our country. Magnificent highways and bridges lead directly to this site. Here is the greatest communications center of the world from which cable and wireless will carry to all people the record of the achievements to be made here. Here in the midst of the great metropolis, the United Nations will have a home that will keep it close to the problems and the hopes of the common man. The dynamic power and throbbing spirit of Manhattan will help to give impetus and vigor to the great work work that lies ahead of the United Nations. New York has every facility to offer that a great city can offer. It has something more for the delegations and secretariat of the United Nations. The population of this city includes men and women who came here from every nation that is a member of the United Nations. They live here in peace and in brotherhood together and each race and culture contributes its share to a common civilization. As the United States representative at the seat of the United Nations, I wish to acknowledge with the full heart the great contribution made by the benevolent men and women of New York to the acquisition by the United Nations of this site. Our heartfelt gratitude goes to Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., whose gift made possible the location of the headquarters here, and to Mr. Nelson Rockefeller and the other members of the Rockefeller family who participated in this act of generosity.

His honor, the mayor, William O'Dwyer, the chairman of the board of estimates of the first of the city of New York. Mr. Chairman, His Excellency Cardinal, Mr. Secretary General, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, New York has been the scene of many historical events. None transcends in importance and significance the ceremony we perform today. The people of the city of New York convey to the peoples of the world a small plot of land. However, on that small plot of land, decisions will be made which will shape the destiny of the world. The people of the world. In what is done here by United Nations must be found the answer to the hope and aspirations of countless millions of people. The hungry, the oppressed, the freedom-loving people of every nation. This is a day of rededication as well as dedication for Americans especially. Two years ago, the architect of the United Nations, the immortal Franklin Delano Roosevelt laid down his life. A soldier in the fight of free men everywhere. Quote, to save the competing generations from the scourge of war, which fights in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind. End of quote. Through the instrumentality of the United Nations, Franklin Delano Roosevelt placed us to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, and the equal rights of men and women, of and of nations, large and small. Today, his successor, President Truman, renewed the pledge that our country will continue to support the work of this great institution upon the success of whose efforts were the folks of the world. Today, we concentrate this site as hallowed ground to be devoted to the noble purposes to which the United Nations are firmly bound. The people of New York City, more than seven and a half million inhabitants of all races, trees, and national origins, reflect in their daily lives the determination of the peoples of the United Nations expressed in the preamble to the great charter. MR. together in peace with one another as good neighbors. Mr. Secretary and Delegate, in that spirit, we welcome United Nations. We open to you not only our land and our homes, but also our hearts. Please, will you please rise while the city flag is lowered. The flags of the 65 nations will now be ready. The flags of the 66, the flags of the 66, after the 32 fly in the band, the flags of New York City, and the boys, the many flags surrounding this area, the boys took to the high position. Ladies and gentlemen, I now have the honor and the privilege, in the name of New York City, your city, and the peoples in it, to present to Mr. Trigby Lee, as Secretary of State, the mayor of the city, and the mayor of the city, and the mayor of the city, and the mayor of the city, and the mayor of the city, and the people in it, to present to Mr. Trigby Lee, as Secretary General, this theme, to the property, for United Nations.

Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen, I take both pride, and pleasure, in accepting the gift of property, which New York City, is today, transferring to the United Nations, for its world capital. I have always, found it easy, and pleasant, to thank New York City, and its authorities, for their acts, of generosity, toward the United Nations. Throughout, the association, which has grown up, between us, they have made it plain, that they regarded themselves, as a part of the United Nations, and that they regarded, the United Nations, as a part of themselves. I would like to tell you, Mr. Mayor, the people of this city, that the United Nations, wholeheartedly, shares those sentiments. We, from the United Nations, are proud, to have the world capital, of the United Nations, established here, on the banks, of the East River, in this great, melting pot, of the peoples, of the world. It is appropriate, as I have said before, that the representatives, of the nations, should come together, to discuss, and to settle, their problems, in a community, where millions, of human beings, of every color, race, and creed, have demonstrated, their ability, to live, and work together, in peace, and understanding. It is our plan, to make the world capital, a splendid, splendid setting, for the work of peace, and human betterment, which we have undertaken. We hope, that, it will attract visitors, from all corners, of the world. And I am sure, that those who come here, will be made, to feel at home. Most important, of all, is our determination, to live, fully up, to the duties, given us, by the San Francisco Charter. And to make, this world capital, worthy, of its position, as the center, of the hopes, the aspirations, and the ideals, of mankind. May I also, take the opportunity, today, to thank again, Mr. Rockefeller, whose foresightedness, and generosity, have played, such a large role, in making this home, of the United Nations, a reality. And I want also, to express, my gratitude, to Governor Dewey, for providing us, with the necessary, state legislation, to proceed, with the fulfillment, of our plans. And the United Nations, thanks, go to the President, of the United States, and his government. On behalf, of the national delegations, to the United Nations, and all members, of the Secretariat, of the United Nations, I send, our best wishes, to the great people, of the United States, of America.

Thank you all for coming. On the playground, on the Franklin v. Roosevelt Drive, better known to all of us, as the East River Drive, between 42nd, and 43rd streets. Your city station, through the facilities, of Mutual's portable, or mobile studio, Johnny on the Spot, has brought you these ceremonies, wherein, Mayor Aguirre, of the City of New York, transferred, to Mr. Trigville Lee, the Secretary General, of the United Nations, a piece of property, which will complete, the site, which is to be, the world capital, the home, of the 55 United Nations. Wilbur Whaling, was the chairman, of the mayor's committee, and acted, as chairman, during the course, of the ceremonies. We first heard, of the City Opera Company, who sang the national anthem. The invocation, was spoken, by Francis Cardinal Spelman. We then heard, briefly, from Senator Warren Austin, senior United States, representative, to the United Nations. Then, Mayor Aguirre, presented, or transferred, the property, to the United Nations, the property, and the deed, being accepted, by Mr. Trigville Lee. The 55, the 55 flags, representing each, of the 55 nations, comprising, the United Nations, were raised, to the top, of their individual masts, upon signal, from Mr. Whalen, who ordered, the lowering, of the flag, of the city, of New York. And so, from this playground, which is no longer, a playground, but is now, the property, of the United Nations, we take, the view, and return you, to our studios, in the municipal building. And so, the building, of the city, of the city, of the city, of the city. Thank you very much. Thank you.
