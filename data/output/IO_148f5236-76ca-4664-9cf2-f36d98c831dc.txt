Dear friends, as Mayor of New York, I bring you greetings on this festive day. We in America, joined by fellow citizens of all nationalities, pay homage on this day to the patron of Ireland, St. Patrick, and to Ireland herself. This year in particular, those of us who are of Irish blood are proud to see the tremendous strides being made in the land of our birth. We are proud to see the strengthening of the historical links between the United States and Ireland. The recent signing of a trade and friendship treaty between our two countries, the raising of legations to the diplomatic status of embassies, the exchange of ambassadors, all indicate that the bonds between our two nations will continue to prosper in a friendly and trusting atmosphere. I wish every one of you a happy St. Patrick's Day. May God bless the people of our countries so that all of us may continue to prosper in peace. Have a good time. Happy St. Patrick, have a great shame.avorkanth.com Thank you.
