The Roundtable is heard one half hour earlier, so be sure to tell your friends to listen for the Roundtable at its new time. Today's program presents a discussion on Let's Join the Human Race. Taking part in this discussion are Stringfellow Barr, author, and former president of St. John's College, and Everett C. Hughes, sociologist of the University of Chicago and president of the Society of Applied Anthropology. Now we present Mr. Hughes. The American people and their leaders are now re-examining their foreign policy. One of the questions to which they give conflicting answers is that of our line of defense. Shall it be in Europe? Shall it be beyond or on this side of the British Isles? Shall it be in the Atlantic, to speak only of our eastern line? This question implies another. Who shall be our allies? Shall we choose them according to their presumed will to fight on our side? Or shall they choose us, for whatever reasons appeal to them in this crisis? Behind this, or these, is the even more bitter question. Can we contain this war? Or can we stave off war? And if we can stave it off, how? And for how long? Mr. Barr, where do you stand in this debate? I suggest, Mr. Hughes, that the thing that's confusing the great debate on foreign policy today is that there are two issues, and only one of them is getting very much discussion. We are talking about the military problem, the immediate military emergency springing out of our intervention in Korea and the catastrophic defeat we suffered in Korea. But there's another issue that hasn't been very well discussed, it seems to me, and that's a political issue. What is our foreign policy to be? And until we settle that one, I think most of the military problems become, in a sense, quibbles. The basic problem, I think, is what kind of foreign policy makes sense for the second half of the 20th century. What you're saying, then, is that though we have a short-run crisis, we need a long-term plan. That's precisely the point I would like to make. Well, what is that proposal? I attempted in this pamphlet, Let's Join the Human Race, which the University of Chicago recently published, to propose a long-term plan that we could offer the rest of the world and participate in. And I suggested that we had some inkling of what this long-term plan would be when President Truman spoke of what we call Point Four, his bold new program. So the economic development of underdeveloped areas. But I'm interested by the fact that the program has not been bold, that it's been extremely timid. I'm interested by the fact that a member of the United States Senate could propose $5 billion a year for the purpose, and that we shortly thereafter appropriated less than $35 million. And I asked myself, in writing the pamphlet, what has kept our discussion of this problem on such a low level? And the only answer I could find was that we are not really looking at the actual planet we live on. We're not really looking at the condition of the people who inhabit it. And therefore, all of our proposals have been a little irrelevant. If you'll indulge me, I think I could state my case best by reading a few lines from the pamphlet itself. Let's join the human race. Here's a portion. Let's pretend that you have not yet been born, but will be born this year somewhere on the planet. And let's try to estimate your chances of living a happy, healthy, decent, and useful life. Here then, on the same day, more than 200,000 other babies will be born all over the world. You will have less than one chance in 20 of being born in the United States. Your chance of being born in the Soviet Union will be not much better. These countries may be heavily armed, but most people just don't live in them. You will probably be born colored. Remember that you and the 200,000 other squawking brats who will be the day's baby crop are going to be born all over the planet, and that there are just not many openings in the places where the white race lives. You must take your chances with the other babies, and the chances are you will be colored. Colored black, or colored brown, or colored yellow. Your chances of being born white this year are not more than one in three. Your chances of being Chinese are one in four, or being born in India better than one in nine. If you are born colored, you will probably be born either among people who have recently revolted, and thrown out the white folks who used to govern them, or else in a country that is still trying to throw the white folks out. If you are born in Africa, you are likely to learn the maxim, never trust a white man. If you are born colored, the chances are overwhelming that you will be chronically sick all your life, from malaria, or intestinal parasites, or tuberculosis, or maybe even leprosy. And even if you are not chronically sick, you are likely to be weak from hunger. You have about a two to one chance of suffering from malnutrition, either from too little food, or from food that is not a balanced or nourishing diet. You have a reasonably good chance of experiencing real famine, to the point where you will be glad to eat the bark off a tree. But this chance is extremely hard to calculate. Again, if you are born colored, you have only a one to four chance of learning to read. And since you almost certainly will not own a radio, you will be pretty well cut off from that part of the human family that has enough to eat, and that is reasonably healthy. You will most likely live in a mud hut, with a dirt floor and no chimney, its roof thatched with straw. You will almost certainly work on the land, and most of what you raise will go to the landlord. In addition, you are likely to be deeply in debt to the local money lender, and you may have to pay an annual interest of anywhere from thirty to one hundred percent. What I am describing is the actual condition of mankind in the middle of the twentieth century. But Mr. Barr, has this not been the condition of mankind throughout most of its history? And if that is so, are you not perhaps intending to call our attention to the fact that while we have not in the past been able to imagine how the poor live, the time has now come when they know pretty well how we live, and wouldn't mind living that way themselves? That is precisely the point I should like to make. It seems to me that in proposing Point Four and discussing this problem, we haven't realized that the rest of the world is fed up with poverty, because they are convinced that it's not necessary. And our discussion of Point Four has rested, and our discussion of our foreign policy, has rested, it seems to me, on four quite false assumptions. The first false assumption is that Russia is all that stands between mankind and a stable peace. And this assumption seems to me inexcusable, because if these people in underdeveloped countries find that all the communists have suddenly and unaccountably died, they will follow whoever else will promise to do something about it. The Asians and Africans will go on fighting and planning to throw the white folks out. The hungry will go on fighting or planning to eat. These peoples are in motion. You and I want peace and quiet, so we can enjoy our unbelievable standard of living. They have nothing to enjoy, so they want change. You're suggesting, are you, Mr. Barr, that we're falling into the old fallacy of thinking that we stopped the social movement by killing off the agitator? I am, Mr. Hughes, and that's better put than it was put in the pamphlet. There's a second false assumption that disturbs me, and that is that American know-how and American money can rebuild the world economy, or enough of it to stop Russia. It seems to me quite obvious that this is not the case. Assuming that there's enough money in America to do the job that we are discussing, I see no reason whatever to expect the Congress to vote the money for that purpose. And the reason the Congress won't vote it seems to me equally as simple, and that is that the American voter never expected his taxes to go to that purpose. And for this reason the Congress won't act. I've often thought of this angle of it too, Mr. Barr, that one that's concerned me more is how this all would look at the receiving end, even if the American voter would let his money go to this end. I quite agree with you. Wherever our money goes now, the normal question in the locality it reaches is, why is the American government doing this? What role are we expected to play in the Cold War? But I think there's another false assumption that's even worse, and it came out very heavily in the Congressional hearings about a year ago. And that is the assumption that private enterprise, or as we like to call it in this country, free enterprise, can do the job better than government anyhow. This seems to me preposterous, because if the voter won't let Congress use their tax money to rescue Indonesia or some remote place the voter's never heard of, why on earth should the investor allow the corporation he has invested his savings in to build a road system or an educational system or hospitals for Indonesia? That's not why he invested. I find this one a little harder to understand, Mr. Barr, than your notion that the voter won't put up for it, because if there's been any great migrant and foreign adventurer in the modern world, it has been capital. And capital of Britain, and of this country to a less extent, has gone all over the world. That's certainly true, Mr. Hughes, but I think we're unwise to draw too many analogies from the 19th century, because in the 19th century, when British capital, notably, was flowing to what we call underdeveloped areas now, the population was not in the frame of mind, it's in the middle of the 20th century. Today, anything like a concession to a foreign power, anything like special arrangements for attracting investments, is regarded with deep suspicion all over the world, as you must have seen some of this in your own investigations. What is bothering me here, however, is that while you've said this can't come with this change in the standard of living of the world that might give us some peace, can't come with funds from Washington, or at least not all of it, and that it won't come with private funds from Wall Street, you haven't quite said where it will come. What is your notion of where these resources can come from? Well, I suppose that if the funds need to be public, and at the same time if they need not to be the funds of one government, and least of all the funds of one of the two chief contestants in the present power struggle, Washington and Moscow, the only proper solution would be public funds put up through an international agency, like some of the specialized agencies of the United Nations. Well, one of the things that seems to be bothering the world is that nobody has any money but us. And here you are talking as though money could spring up out of the ground in a lot of these very countries of whose poverty you're complaining. Well, the best economists that I know who have written on this problem, who have thought about the problem and addressed themselves to it, are pretty eloquent in pointing out, Mr. Hughes, that in their judgment dollars are not the only useful currency in this particular job. That, for example, there would be enormous wage bills involved if we were to tackle the job, and that these wage bills could be met in local currencies, even where the currencies are softened. That may be so, but it seems to me that there's a certain implication in all of your pamphlet that lifting a standard of living, which would presumably be done by some kind of industrializing, is a sort of easy thing to do, and it can be done by the neighbors getting together and having a nice talk. I would say that what, from the little I've seen of this industrializing process, that it's a very tough one, not only financially, but in every other way a person can think of. It's a rugged problem, and I certainly hope that the pamphlet doesn't lead people to think that it would be a cinch to do it. I think the United Nations, with proper backing from us and other countries, could do it, and I think the pattern for doing it is already known throughout the world. It was set by us Americans in the Tennessee Valley when we set up the TVA, which is enormously known all over the world. But I think, as you point out, that industrializing any area, shifting its economy drastically, is a little like a war. A lot of people get hurt, with the best management in the world, a lot get hurt. And we'll have to face up to that the way a surgeon faces up to pain. The difference, however, it seems to me is that when you go hurting people in an industrial revolution, they're still there to fight back. And I personally am very doubtful whether there can be any such thing as a basic industrial revolution, which will not raise a lot of political unrest. And no matter how well or how nicely or in how friendly a fashion it may be done, a lot of this political unrest can turn against us, who after all will be in some sense the initiators, as well as against someone else. I'm afraid you're correct. I think you might admit, Mr. Hughes, that some of that danger can be minimized by its being done on a truly international basis. I think one of the difficulties with having Americans do it is not merely the reason I gave that the voter wouldn't back it up or that the investor wouldn't back it up, but that actually you arouse a kind of anti-Americanism by the very violence of the changes that must be made. I think international auspices would partly cure that, but I admit the implication of your statement that they couldn't hope to cure it entirely. Well, of course, I would argue on your side a little bit on this, that whether we cured it or not, it would be whether we managed to do this peacefully, and with everybody loving us or not, we should do it anyway. As a matter of fact, one of my little misgivings, not merely about the whole process, but about your plan for it, is that we Americans may have got a little too much in the frame of mind where we like to be loved. Our good old forefathers, whether British or American or German or whatever, didn't much mind whether the people out on the frontiers of the world liked them or not. Sometimes they were pretty ruthless. I don't think that we will necessarily be ruthless. As a matter of fact, I think we might, in some respects, be too nice, and in the hope that everybody would love us for having raised their standing of living. I think you're correct about us. I think one of our most ingenuous traits, not without a certain charm, is that we're very shocked when we discover that we aren't liked. We assume, in somewhat the way children do, that naturally everybody likes us, and when they don't like us, we tend to sulk and pout and want to go home and say, well then, stew in your juice and we'll pull in our horns and stay within our own borders and on to the teeth and make a Gibraltar. In other words, you're saying that we might turn back and substitute a kind of go-at-alone-ism for our older isolationism. I think that's the constant risk we run, and I would suggest, Mr. Hughes, that the reason some of Mr. Hoover's recent remarks, and Mr. Taft's also alarmed people, was that they detected this go-at-alone-ism and knew that it was irrelevant to the middle of this century, that it isn't a practicable program. Well, I'm still bothered by your TVA model. I know that the TVA has become a world symbol, and I know that nearly everyone who comes here from abroad wants to see this American miracle, and that it has a great appeal to their imagination. I know that it's being tried in river valleys and other such natural areas in other parts of the world. But you seem to suggest that this TVA must be on a world scale, or else not done at all, or am I misinterpreting you? You're not misinterpreting me, Mr. Hughes, in this sense. I think anything of this sort that is done now is all to the good, and I was delighted to see how much of it was being done in Latin America under Nelson Rockefeller's leadership. But I think that we won't get any kind of workable stability in the world until it's done on a very much larger scale than has yet been envisaged. But do you think that we should not do anything in an international way until we can get practically everybody in? I don't see any necessity, Mr. Hughes, to insist on getting everybody in, but it seems to me that unless enough nations come in to make it not an American show, but a human show, that all the risks that you have quite rightly located become very much more staggering in their dreadful impediment to what we are doing. But suppose a person were to say, as indeed you have said, that most of these poverty-stricken peoples, while they may know something about our higher standards of living, are without a radio, and can't trade, and therefore can hardly be expected to be very active in so unusual a thing as an international gathering to talk about world economic problems. It would then seem that we either must wait a long time, or else do nothing. Well, I think you would probably agree with me that the representatives of those people, and notably those now at Lake Success as delegates from their respective governments, are very sensitive on the necessity for this work being done. They're much more sensitive than our press has given us any inkling of. It is certain that a lot of the populations at home whom they represent don't know much about it. My suspicion is that the grapevine would work pretty fast if a TVA of the world, a World Development Authority, got operating in an area that most peasants would find out about it pretty shortly. At present, they are certainly not in a position to judge. That may be, and I can see the point of a world project as an ideal, but I should very much hate to think that we would hesitate to do what we can at the time, on a long-term planning basis, just because we think it would be ideal to have the whole world in. There are some other questions, however, Mr. Barr, that I would like to put to you on the actual process by which industrialization and raising of a standard of living, the process by which that occurs. One thing is quite clear, it seems to me, is that people's actual standard of living goes up, the one they would like to attain goes up even faster. So that it might very well be that a general raise in the level of living of the peoples of the world would increase their envy of the few really bright spots instead of decreasing it. I think that's a risk we would certainly have to run. I know of no way of, no really practicable way of avoiding the risk. I don't think we can afford to say, either morally or in terms of hard-boiled politics, well, let them sweat it out now in starvation, because if they ate three meals a day, they just want a Cadillac anyhow, and they might make more trouble for us than they're making now. So I don't know how to avoid the very genuine difficulty you allude to. And another one like it seems to me, or perhaps worse than this, is this. A lot of the peoples of the world have seen Western industrial capitalism at work. They saw it when it was in its worst phase in the 19th century. To be sure, they've seen it improve a great deal. But they perhaps tend to emphasize its worst features. They think they know us. The Russians have the advantage in the use of words, it seems to me, because they don't know the Russians at first hand. They know only their words. Therefore, it seems to me that we are in the plight of having our propaganda discounted more than they. Perhaps we are driven to the propaganda of action more than the Russians will be for some time to come. I think that's true, Mr. Hughes. I think that only the propaganda of deeds from now on in is going to make very much sense to most of the world. I don't think that the words we are offering them mean very much one way or the other. And I do suggest that the disadvantage at which we are, I agree with you, is much more serious, a much more serious disadvantage as long as we try to go it alone and play Santa Claus from Washington than it would be if we were merely one of the participants, although the biggest participant in terms of money, in a genuinely international enterprise. I think that the way we are, I think, is the way we are. Still along this same theme is this question. Capital has often moved in the past, or has been said to move, to a new region in order to find cheaper labor and to go back to a previous state of employer-employee relationships. What do you think of the possible danger that we might repeat this in some of these new sections of the world, even though we were not the exclusive investors in the deal? I should think that most certainly, if it were done on the basis of private enterprise, which so many people urge, exactly what you fear would happen. I should think that one reason that peoples all over the world have admired the Tennessee Valley Authority is that in this instance, public funds were used with a constant and conscious effort to prevent just the difficulty that you allude to, to make sure that the least privileged elements in the population actually profited by the changes that were being caused. Of course, this last question I put to you in a rather academic way. My own opinion on this is that the 19th century employer, who after all, although he may have been ruthless, was a man who was convinced of the rightness of what he was doing, did not mean to be evil. And I'm also quite convinced that the 20th century American employer, or rather the 20th century engineer, manager, is not nearly so tough a guy as he sometimes perhaps would like to think that he is, and certainly not so tough as many of his enemies make him out. Well, by way of summary, since our time is short, let me offer these remarks. I have tried to suggest in Let's Join the Human Race, I've tried to suggest to the reader, first, that the positive, constructive foreign policy we need, while handling our military problem as best we can, is a policy of rebuilding the world's economy in order that the peoples of the world shall rally in a common effort. That Point Four was aimed at this, but that it's been a timid effort, that it's been timid because our thinking about Point Four has rested on false assumptions. It's true, I added in the pamphlet a kind of proposal, a suggestion, I imagined a kind of world TVA as handling the problem. But I should hope that my readers would pay most attention to the question, are the false assumptions I have enumerated, and that we have discussed here, false? Because if they are, we need a very sharp shift in our foreign policy. And you're saying to the American people, let's be enterprising, but on a world basis, and for everyone. Not merely for the few of us who live in this little rich suburb. Thank you, gentlemen.
