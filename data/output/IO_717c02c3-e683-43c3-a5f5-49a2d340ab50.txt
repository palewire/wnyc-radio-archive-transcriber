This is Cornelia Otis Skinner. I would like to tell you about an organization that is helping to give more young Americans the opportunity to continue their education, to become the teachers, doctors, nurses, and social workers so urgently needed today. It's a chance these young men and women might otherwise never have had if it were not for the United Negro College Fund. You see, the fund helps 32 accredited Negro colleges and universities meet yearly operating expenses. Most of their students must depend on scholarship or work aid, so tuition, board, and room fees must be kept as low as possible. That's why these colleges need your help to give more scholarship aid to deserving students, buy books for their libraries, pay teaching expenses. As a sponsor and as a contributor, I urge you to give generously to the United Negro College Fund campaign in your community. This is John Mason Brown.

It may be that I am an incurable optimist, but I have experienced both the handicaps and the rich opportunities of American life, and I do not think my case is unique. Negro Americans have made important progress in my lifetime, and I expect to see much more, particularly if the opportunity for education is increased. The United Negro College Fund is working to make that opportunity real for thousands of boys and girls by helping to finance 32 private accredited Negro colleges and universities. A contribution to the United Negro College Fund in your city, sent today, will help to make American democracy fulfill its richest promise. A message from John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Mr. Rockefeller. Today, if liberty is to be preserved, all the citizens of the nation must be educated to the responsibilities as well as to the opportunities that are inherent in freedom. That is why I believe that the colleges and universities now training a large share of this country's Negro youth merit the generous support of the American public. Their graduates as teachers, ministers, doctors, nurses, and social workers are an influence for better community race relations wherever they serve. Thirty-two of these colleges are now appealing for aid through the United Negro College Fund's nationwide campaign. As an active worker since the first campaign in 1944, and as a contributor in support of the colleges it represents, it is my conviction that the appeal of the United Negro College Fund is one which no thoughtful American can afford to overlook.
