When I'm part of him, I'll holler. Do ye hear like rushing billows? Wave on wave, and surging fallow. Have all this and sound. Hear the trample, Saxon-Folmen. Saxon-Fearmen, Saxon-Folmen. Be they guys, or I know you'll have. They'll fight the ground. Through the fall of thunder, flag we conquer under. The flag that drives our flag, nor the law is under. From where the country needs us, he is brave as he who leads us. Honor sells how proud he has done. Freedom, love, and rise. Rockies, thieves, and glasses narrow. Flash with fear and flight of arrow. Fluid danger of death or sorrow. Death is glory now. Earl, the reeling, parchment over. Let the earth, gentlemen, cover. Clean a friend, a wife, a lover. Clean a friend, a wife, a lover. Clean a friend, a lover. And of life are written. Flow for glory is given. In value, passing a bird, passing. And leading to heaven. To man of politics, young authority. Would you win a name in story. Cry for all, for life, for glory. Freedom, God, and rise. For their third and concluding number, the Glee Club presents Benny Havens. A ballad sung by sons of West Point for over a hundred years. And sung today wherever West Pointers gather. Come till your glasses, fellows. Come till your glasses, fellows. And stand up in our row. To singing sentimentally. We're going for to go. In the Army there's so priety. From what I'm very slow. So we'll sing our grand, Millicent's end. Of Benny Havens all. Oh, Benny Havens all. We'll sing our grand, Oh, Benny Havens all. We'll sing our grand, Oh, Benny Havens all. To our kind old alma mater. Our rock-bound island home. We'll cast back many upon regret. As for life's feet we roam. Until our land, our battle is. The lights of heaven shall flow. We'll never fail to drink through birth. And Benny Havens all. Oh, Benny Havens all. Oh, Benny Havens all. We'll sing our grand, And so many upon regret. May the army be augmented, So more guns be let flow. May our country in the hour of need, be ready for the cold a sudden a sudden Oh, we're strolling up in thy heart's name for many havens Oh, many havens Oh, many havens We'll sing our remnant and of many havens Oh From West Point we conclude this quarter hour of song by the Cadet Glee Club conducted by Cadet G.
