Come on, Mr. Walker. Well, well, well, well. Hello everybody. Come on, Mr. Walker. Mr. Walker. Mr. Walker. Mr. Walker. Yes, son, what's the matter? Look who's ahead of us. Huh? Well, am I surprised. It's the corn cobblers. And look, they're going to play something. Let's hurry over and listen. Come on. Yeah, my friends. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Golly, I like the way the corn cobblers did the three blind mice. Ha ha. It sure was a lot of fun. Oh, but I almost forgot. Uh, Jeanie here told me she had some sort of a problem. Yes. Yes, Mr. Barker. I have a girlfriend who told... Excuse me, Mr. Barker. I didn't interrupt, but couldn't you find out about Jeanie's problems later? Oh. While the corn cobblers were playing, I happened to wander over to the air-conditioned record house. And I found out that a new album just arrived. Oh, boy, what's it all about? Oh, I didn't have time to listen. I just looked at the cover. It's a story about Paul Bunyan. Oh. And I think that Paul Bunyan's stories are wonderful. Oh, so do I. Oh, you do. Well, I guess that means you boys and girls want to go over and listen to it. Well, it's all right with me, but, uh, now, wait, just a minute, I'll have to ask Jeanie if she wouldn't mind telling me about her problems. Um. Um, hmm. Yes, well, Jeanie. Um, yeah. Well, oh, all right, I guess I can wait. Besides, I want to hear the story about Paul Bunyan. Oh, that's fine. Fine, Jeanie. All right, come on, boys and girls. Let's hurry down the midway to the air-conditioned record house. Here we are. Now, Mr. Barker, you and the others sit down and make yourselves comfortable. I'll go to the room of the new albums and put the Paul Bunyan story on the turntable. Oh, fine. A very good idea. Well, come on, everybody. Let's sit down in these big easy chairs. Oh, yeah. There you are. You over there. That's it. Oh, sure feels good to get off my feet. Why are you so tired, Mr. Barker? Well, I'm pretty busy all week, you know, looking for stories and music for the story fair. And on Saturday mornings, when you're all still sleeping, I'm out here at the story fairground setting up the tents and the stands and finding stories like the story of Paul Bunyan. The poor little Mary was very frightened. She couldn't move. She was so scared. She just stood there like a statue as Neptune raised his trident and aimed it right at her. She screamed and... Oh! Oh, no! Mary! Mary, wake up! Oh, no! Why didn't you stay with us? Oh, no, no, don't stab me. I'm sorry. I won't... Mary, what's the matter with you? No one is going to stab you. It must have been a dream. Oh, oh, I guess it was. Oh, Miss Simmons, I dreamed that Neptune was going to stab me with his pitchfork. Trident, I mean. That's silly. How could he? He's only a statue. Oh, but I talked to several of the statues. To Mercury and to the discus floor and to Cupid and Psyche and then to that awful Neptune. I couldn't have dreamed the stories I heard. Well, I noticed you have a guidebook from the museum in your hand. You must have been reading it before you went to sleep. Well, I guess I was. Gee, it was interesting. My dream. Miss Simmons, I'm sorry I ran away. I just found out that a museum can be very interesting. I'm going to come more often. No, I should punish you. But I don't think you'll disobey again. Oh, I won't. And, Miss Simmons, could I tell the class about my dream tomorrow? Yes, dear. But now let's join the others and go home. We wouldn't want to be locked up here all night with the statue. Oh, no. In case it wasn't a dream, I wouldn't want Neptune to chase me again. Even though I was scared for a little while, I'm awfully glad I came to the museum. Well, how'd you like that? You know, Mr. Barker, that was a wonderful story. Yes. I bet my girlfriend will feel a lot different about going to a museum now. Good. Yes, it's a swell story. Well, I'm glad you liked it, girls. Oh, just a minute. How did you boys like the story about Mary and the gods? Terrific. That's the best one I heard in a long time. Oh, good, good. That's fine. Now, what are we going to do, Mr. Barker? Well, now, let me see. How about listening to some music? I mean, some good music. Now, who wants to hear just music? Now, now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I didn't mean just music. I meant the life of a great composer and some of his best music. Oh, that sounds all right to me. Now, I promise you that this is very special. But I don't want to do anything unless we all agree to it. All right? What do you think? All right. What do you think? Well, all right. It might be good. I'll listen. All right, fine. Now, this is the story of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, a great Russian composer. And Floyd Mack is going to tell you about his life. Who's going to play the music? The Vox Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Max Goberman. Oh, I've heard that orchestra. It's very good. That's right. All right, now, quiet, please. And let's listen to the story and music of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky. How did you like that? You were right, Mr. Barker. It was very good. I'm glad I decided to listen. Good boy. All right, now, uh, now it's time for the Junior Journal Reporter. Come on, boys and girls. Let's go in and take our seats. Say, the news was very interesting today. What do you mean today? It always is. You said it and I'm just crazy about Clarence the hobby mail truck. Me too. Me too. Hey, now, now, wait a minute. I feel like, uh, Venus who was neglected when Psyche came along. Oh, Mr. Barker, don't be foolish. Don't you know we like everybody and everything at the store he says? Well, that's, that's fine, that's fine. You should like everything and everybody everywhere. And here's someone who thinks that way too. I like democracy. Hmm. I'm for equality. Hmm. I say be neighborly. Hmm. Do I practice while I preach? What makes a good American? What do you have to be? Am I a good American? Let's look again and see. Hmm. I don't care where you're from. Hmm. I go by what you are. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. I stand up for my rights. Hmm. But do I stand up for yours? What makes a good American? What do you have to do? Am I a good American? And by the way, are you? Well, come on, boys and girls, let's hurry out of the fairgrounds. Come on with me down the midway. The story fair is over for today. But don't forget to come back again next week for more stories, for more visits to our strange and wonderful tents, for another visit with the junior journal reporter. And don't forget that the Saturday morning story fair, the biggest, the most stupendous show on earth, is absolutely free. So goodbye, boys and girls. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Marsh, Sylvia Davis, Jane Garvin, Hillary Dell, and Court Falkenberg. Sound was by Don Wiedemann.
