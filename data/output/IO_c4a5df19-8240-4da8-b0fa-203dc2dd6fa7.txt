Good afternoon everyone from the 106th Regiment Armory in Brooklyn. Your city station brings you some of the highlights of the interfaith party of the Boys Club of Brownsville. There are many distinguished guests here this afternoon. The police glee club and the fire department band are present to assist in the entertainment. Right now here is the noted folk humorist Sam Levinson who is to be our master of ceremonies. Okay Sam Levinson. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. We are at the Armory Bedford Avenue and Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn where we have about 5,000 children of all denominations gathered this afternoon for a Christmas and Hanukkah celebration. An interfaith party all faces all kinds all sizes all breeds all colors. They've now had their sandwiches and if you want to hear how happy they are I'm going to ask them to say hello to you. A cheer. You have just heard the voices of 5,000 happy children. Right now they're shaking hands with each other in a gesture of brotherly love. Shake hands everybody. There goes the handshake. You can't hear that but I think you can get the general spirit that's coming over the microphone and the airwaves. This party has been organized by the Brownsville Boys Club. Eighth stock who ends the whole thing with the help of very wonderful civic leaders from Brooklyn and Manhattan. I would like at first to introduce a gentleman who is well known in public life. One of the master storytellers and public speakers of America Mr. Harry Hirshfield. Ladies, gentlemen, to the children assembled a few weeks ago in eastern Germany, 250,000 children were put together against their will to cheer for a subversive communist country. I want to see now so they can hear it there what it sounds for 10,000 American children to drown out those in eastern Germany. Let's hear it. канале- Children, you are wonderful, and I want you to listen to this. Twenty-five years from now, I want you to remember this day so that you in turn tell it to your children and their children and their children's children that you live in a land, you live in a city that makes you free. I am now, this is important, I am going to introduce to you a man who today and every day represents and represents specifically today the mayor of the city of New York, this great city, who represents this great mayor. I want you to know that it would be impossible unless you had a government in a city that recognizes your worth and your rights to happiness. We wouldn't be having this today. Let me introduce to you who will speak for the city of New York, so vital at this time, I give you this exceptionally able administrator representing today the mayor and the city of New York, Deputy Mayor Charles Horowitz. Harry Hirschfield, children, ladies and gentlemen. I am here today at the request of Mayor Impeletere to represent him and the people of the city of New York at this remarkable outpouring of the wonderful children of the city of New York, gathered together here in the 106th Regiment Armory at Bedford Avenue and Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn. Now the mayor was very, very anxious to be with all of you boys and girls and to celebrate this event with you. But you know, the city of New York is a great big place and it has a lot of business to conduct as part of its government affairs. And so the mayor has been forced to remain at City Hall, attending a special meeting of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment. And he has asked me to come here and I'm honored and I'm privileged and I'm very happy to be here with you. Now for the benefit of the radio audience who are not given this great privilege of being here in person and witnessing what is going on in this armory, may I say to you in the humble powers of description that I possess, that this is a most inspiring sight. Here we have before us close to 10,000 children, the cream of the American crop of youngsters from all parts of our city and particularly from Brooklyn. Every race, every creed, every color, all are assembled here. And here we are witnessing democracy and Americanism in action. And what is this great event? This is an event being conducted by the Brownsville boys. It is a combination Christmas and Hanukkah celebration. And the sponsors of this affair are the hard-working individuals who constitute the membership of the Brownsville boys. And above all, the leading spirit and the leading force is one of the outstanding great citizens of the city of New York, none other than Abe Stark. He is the outstanding individual responsible and the spark plug for setting off this wonderful affair. Now on this platform to my left, symbolic of the Christmas season, is a magnificent Christmas tree adorned with beautiful ornaments and its many colored lights. And on the right is the menorah, which is the symbol of the festival of lights, the Hanukkah celebration observed by the people of the Jewish faith. And here we have these boys and girls, each one of whom, every one of the 10,000 who had lunch here, refreshments, each of whom is receiving a gift. And mind you, over and above that gifts, we have the unusual situation here where children who never had the opportunity of starting or having a savings bank account, 5,000 of them today will be awarded bank books, opening accounts of $1 a piece for each of them so that they may be started on a career of saving and having something that is their own. Oh, this is wonderful and very inspiring and a great tribute to our American way of life, a great tribute. And I bring to you the gratitude of the Mayor Impelichari and all of the people of the city of New York and congratulations and felicitations to Abe Stark and all others who are responsible for this marvelous affair. God bless you all. Thank you, Deputy Mayor Charles Horowitz, representing Mayor Impelichari for the city of New York. Ladies and gentlemen, we are in this tremendous armory, the 106th Armory, and I feel with all the big brass around, I feel like the rookie soldier, the rookie soldier that walked back of a soldier, hit him on the back, knocked him down, and the fellow got up and said, Do you know who I am? He said, No. He said, I'm General Eisenhower. And he said, Do you know who I am? He said, No. He said, Thank God. That's why I feel about this one. Now, now you know what I mean. Ladies and gentlemen, it falls to my great privilege to introduce one whom I have introduced time and time again. And I'm always happy in the thought of introducing him because I always feel like I am introducing him the first time. Because the first impression of this man, when you see him and hear his voice, you feel exuding from him all that is good and noble. And he is good and noble. And he is good and noble. Every great undertaking in these last few years, topped today by this unbelievable demonstration of freedom, tolerance, a fight for Americanism in every way, regardless of race, color, and creed. He stands first as a citizen, not only of Brooklyn, but of all these United States. With pride, I introduce the head of the Bronzeville Boys Club and this great Chanukah and interfaith movement. I give you with all the pride I can summon and I want you to appreciate this name and you do, Mr. Abraham Stark. Mr. Mayor, Harry Hirschfeld, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, and children all, this is your party. And as your party, I say to you, call it what you may. To some of you, you may want to call it a Christmas party. That's perfectly all right. To others, it is a Chanukah party. That's all right. But as a general overall picture, to every one of us here, to everyone in America, we would like to call it an interfaith party on behalf of all children and all people of America. To those who have made this party possible, the directors of the Bronzeville Boys Club, the Women's Division, the Alumni, the Brookborough Club, and many others as I go on later on that I'm going to speak about, All we are concerned is that you're all happy. And I am here not only speaking for myself, but also speaking for the co-chairman of this entire party. Two of them are on the dais. And I'm going to ask them to stand up and take a bow. One of them is Abe Roth. Abe Roth, will you stand up? And the other one is Judge Arthur Dunai. Judge Dunai. Then there are the chairman of the women's division that are out there working amidst you, and chairman of the 46th Club and the Brookborough and so forth. However, at this moment it is my special privilege to call on a gentleman who two years ago permitted us to run our annual dinner in his honor. And it was one of the most successful dinners in the history of the Bronzeville Boys Club. And last year, again, he called together a group of people within the kind funds of his own bank and helped us raise additional money to make it possible to complete sometime in 1952 the Bronzeville Boys Club that will cost three quarters of a million dollars. And so it is my pleasure to introduce to you the president of the East New York Savings Bank, Judge Edward Richards. It would be fine if you boys and girls could for a moment be as quiet as possible, for it's very difficult to see the president of the United States. Judge Edward Galt to speak from here. I think that I know you boys and girls, and you know me and the East New York Savings Bank very, very well. It was because of our interest in you boys and girls, that I was very happy to have the privilege of joining with Abe Stark in this great and wonderful demonstration. Do not give credit to me in any respect for what has been done. Because the spark plug of this whole affair, the man that has been back of it, the man that has established the Bronzeville Boys Club, the man that is going to build a wonderfully fine building for the boys of Bronzeville is not the speaker, but is Abe Stark. Give him a hand. Give him a hand. Give him a hand. I am here today because I love, admire, and respect the public spirit and the great accomplishments of this man of Brownsville. And I hope he will live many, many years to put into many enterprises the enthusiasm and the strength that he's put into the Brownsville Boys Club. Abe, my hat is off to you. God bless you. Sam, eddie. Ivan, exemplars me. Five thousand of you children are receiving a public school bank account of one dollar each. $1 each. I'm going to ask Dr. Charles Eichel, who has done an unbelievable job in organizing this entire affair here of the children, to bring on the stage a few children to represent all of you. Dr. Eichel. Stay right here. And now I'm going to ask two of the gentlemen on the stage here to make the presentation to them. One of them is Judge Ed Richards, the president of the East New York Savings Bank, and who more than him should present the bank accounts to the children. Then I'm going to ask the deputy mayor of the city of New York, Charlie Hurwitz, to come here. He represents the city of New York and all you children. I'm going to ask both of them to present to the children their bank accounts on behalf of all of you. perhaps there's nothing better in the world that you children should have, except your Bibles and your prayer books, than a savings bank account so that you may build up your financial structure while you are young. I know you'll need it when you are old. I'm very happy on behalf of the Brownsville Boys Club and through Abe Stark to present to some of these folks here a passbook. many, many more of you have already had yours or will get them. As part of this great interfaith celebration being held by the Brownsville Boys at the 106th Armory under the auspices of Abe Stark, we are donating today or giving to 5,000 children bank books opening accounts of $1 each for each child in a savings bank. And it is part of my privilege and honor as the deputy mayor of the city of New York, First of all, to express appreciation to Abe Stark and the Brownsville Boys for encouraging these youngsters to engage in the habit of saving and to present to these children these bank books in the hope that it will mean the start of a great and prosperous career for each and every one of them. I'm now going to ask two of the children, Linda Rose first and then Robert Tomlinson, who represents all of you, to say a word or two. Linda. Mr. Deputy Mayor, it is a great honor for me to receive this bank book from you personally. I know I shall never forget this moment. To you, Mr. Stark, and to the Brownsville Boys Club, there are no words to express our gratitude. I speak for all the girls present today. I know that years from now, I will look back on this day and remember you and your coworkers, co-workers who have made this one of the happiest days in our lives. Thank you, Linda. And now Robert Tomlinson. Robert. Mr. Deputy Mayor, Judge Richards, and ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of all the boys who are here today, I want to thank Mr. Abe Starks for the bust of broaders here, for the delicious lunch, for this bank deposit, and for the wonderful entertainment that we enjoy. I know that you have set a fine example here for us today. And I hope that when we are grown men, we too can set such an example for our children. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. All right. You can go. Thank you. And now, my friends, this great big party just didn't happen. We needed the help of an awful lot of people. And we had to inform the world so that maybe through this party other sections of America would do the same. And who more than our own local paper could have done it? And so we called on the Brooklyn Eagle, the prized Pulitzer-winning newspaper, to help us in this job. And I'm happy to say and I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the president and publisher of the Brooklyn Eagle, Mr. Frank Schwartz, for all he has done in helping us put this party over. And now, there are some gentlemen who have helped tremendously. Mr. Joe Belsky, Mr. Ben Levine, Mr. Phil Boris, and Izzy Lipp of the Kosher Butchers Association. Mr. Nat Messing, who is on the stage right here, Nat Messing, will you stand up? And Ed Hoffman of the Waiters Local 2 went all out to do a terrific job. Mr. Harry Dallas and Abe Silverstein of Local 325 of the Koch and Countemens Union, as well as Arnold Cohn and Theodore Lipsy of the Candy Association. Mr. David Durst and William Walford of the Bakers Union. And Mr. Morris Horn, the business manager of the Provision Salesmen's Association. Now, there are so many that I should thank and I'd like to thank, but that's impossible. You have it in your programs. You can read all the names and know who there are. But sitting on the dais here is the fire commissioner of the city of New York, who is good enough to see that we have the fire department banned here. And I'm going to ask him to stand up and take a bow, Mr. Jacob Gromet. Commissioner Jacob Gromet. Thanks. Thanks, Commissioner. It was wonderful and your men did a marvelous job. And the same goes to the men of the fire department, who also did an exceptional job. Up here on the dais also is the attorney general of the state of New York, who just arrived. I'd like him to stand up and take a bow. Attorney General Nathaniel Goldstein of the state of New York. Would you say a word, General? Let him say a word. Yeah, say a word. Avon, friends. This is a real great party. It can only happen in New York City. It can only happen with Abe Stark as a mentor. I want to wish you all a happy chronicle and a happy New Year. Thanks ever so much. Just like we have one second to introduce Postmaster Quigley. Is he here? How about a bow? Postmaster? That's right. That's right. Kids, we have about one minute. I'm going to turn you back to my good friend Ziggy over here. You've heard him on the records. He's been wonderful. He helped run this whole show. He's going to get us all to sing so the Ziggy Lane so that everybody can hear you at home. All right, kids, we're on the air. Let's sing that song that we sang so well before. God bless America. Come on, kids, let's stand up and sing it. We're in the air. Come, let's sing it. Let's sing it. Come, let's sing it. Let's sing it. Come, let's sing it on. Let's sing it on. Let's sing it on and sing it to the합. Come, let's sing it on and sing it. Of the marvelous holes, so well above. From the valley to the valley, to the coast of the coast. God bless America, my home has been born. God bless America, our home is born.
