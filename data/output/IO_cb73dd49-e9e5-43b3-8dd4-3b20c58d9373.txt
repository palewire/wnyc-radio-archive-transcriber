Every one of them is a potential target for an atom bomb. What are you doing about it? What is your personal plan for survival? This is the 24th in a weekly series of programs called Plan for Survival, broadcast over the Civil Defense Radio Network. This network links virtually every radio station in New York State and operates entirely by air. It can function even if regular communication lines are destroyed. Now, here is Bill Leonard. Later in this program, we'll have an announcement concerning future broadcasts. At the moment, we are concerned with first aid, our topic for today, and our guest will be Dr. Hollis Ingraham, Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health. He'll answer questions that have been sent us by listeners, and then local stations will have the opportunity to discuss the subject as it applies to their individual communities. Our first question, Dr. Ingraham, what should a first aid kit actually contain? The contents of a first aid kit for atomic bombing are common items and easy to obtain. They have already been listed by the New York State Civil Defense Commission. In a bulletin issued to civilian defense directors in May of this year, every family was urged to stockpile a pound of salt, two or three blankets, a pound of baking soda, and a flashlight with several batteries. For each person in the family, there should be stored one sheet, two large bath towels, two face towels, 12 large safety pins, and three rolls of three-inch bandage. What do you use these items for? I can understand, well, the bandages, but how about the towels and the blankets? Well, the blankets are for keeping the injured person warm. The sheets and towels will serve as large bandages, particularly useful in covering burns. The sheets may also be torn up to make extra bandages for stopping hemorrhages, applying splints, and as padding. The salt and baking soda are to be added to drinking water, given persons who have lost blood or have been burned. One teaspoonful of salt and roughly a half teaspoonful of soda should be added to a quart of water. Dr. Ingraham, how about radiation sickness? Do you need anything for that? No, there's no need for first aid treatment of radiation illness. The symptoms are not evident for many hours after exposure, and when they are developed, they require hospital care. The types of injuries which must be looked after are burns, bleeding, broken bones, and open wounds. You may have noticed that no mention is made of antiseptics. In general, it is better not to attempt to cleanse wounds, but merely to stop bleeding and to protect by bandaging the injured part from further soiling. If you handle wounds, you may introduce more germs or drive those that are on the surface into the deeper tissue. Now, although every family should prepare a first aid kit, skill in first aid is much more important. The very best first aid kit is a trained mind. Is there any difference between the kind of first aid I must know to care for ordinary household or automobile accidents and the kind I should know for atomic warfare? No. What you need to know is the same, but there may be a big difference in how you use what you know. After the bomb, there cannot be enough positions to minister to all who need care. And in addition, large areas may be isolated for hours by fire or debris. Under these circumstances, the survival of your family and of your neighbors will very largely depend on what type of first aid care you can offer. There is a distinct difference between the value of first aid in normal peacetimes and first aid in civil defense. Just what is the difference? Well, in peacetime, one should give only minimum aid to the patient before the arrival of a physician. And above all, do nothing that may harm the patient. However, fire will be one of the gravest dangers after atomic bombing, and seriously injured people will have to be moved from the fire area promptly, even though doing so may on occasion increase the seriousness of their wounds. Now, you don't have to learn a great deal to be a real help to yourself, your loved ones, and your neighbors. There are a few simple procedures and facts of what one should and should not do that can easily be learned. Where can I get training in first aid? The State Health Department has developed as part of its civil defense activities a course in self-help and neighbor help. This course requires only eight hours of instruction. At least one adult in every family should complete this course. It's being offered under the auspices of the Civil Defense Commission, and your local director of civil defense will tell you where this training can be had. The course in self-help and neighbor help is designed to do just what its name implies, to enable every individual to help himself, his family, and his neighbors survive from injuries until medical care is available. The subject matter has been condensed so as to encourage the widest possible enrollment. Dr. Ingraham, tell me something. What first aid course is advised for more intensive training? The Red Cross first aid course. Those persons who volunteer to help in the medical aspects of civil defense require more intensive training, and all such people are urged to take the standard American Red Cross course. It's the function of the Red Cross to give the intensive training necessary for all those volunteers for civil defense whose primary function is the care of the injured. The people so trained will assist in first aid stations, hospitals, and other medical installations. All of these people, unless already trained, will need intensive training and first aid. Their functions, while varied, will be roughly comparable to the hospital corpsmen of the Navy and their counterparts in the Army. We're all well aware of the great contribution these men made in establishing the unparalleled record for carrying the wounded in the last war. There is a crying and urgent need for such volunteers in civil defense right now. Will you sum up the problem for us, Doctor? Yes. There are three things to keep in mind. First, the kit itself is relatively simple in nature and will do as much in caring for severe injuries and burns as more elaborate outfits. Second, what the person knows is much more important than the material he stores. Third, the greatest contribution that you can make towards saving lives after an atomic bombing is to enroll in the self-help and neighbor help course or the intensive Red Cross course. Then volunteer for service in civil defense. An alert, prepared, and vigorously cooperating people cannot be overwhelmed. Thank you, Dr. Hollis Ingraham, Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health. Now I'd like to tell our listeners, beginning next week, July 11th, Plan for Survival will present the first of four on-the-spot reports of the civil defense story. We'll have more information about civil defense in just a moment. This concludes the New York State portion of this civil defense program. This is Bill Leonard again. In our studios to answer questions listeners in the New York City area have sent us concerning first aid, we have Dr. Theodore Rosenthal, Assistant Commissioner for Medical Emergency Services of the Department of Health of New York City. Dr. Rosenthal lists first questions from a family living in Queens. They appear to have built their shelter. They're now worried about the fact that they may be isolated for hours in their shelter with some member of their family maybe injured. They ask wouldn't it be advisable to make first aid training a must in every home. All persons in the community are urged to take first aid training, though we cannot compel them to do so. Certainly, I think the sensible thing to do is to be fully prepared for an emergency by getting adequate instruction in first aid. There are several ways to do it. You can take either the standard Red Cross first aid training course or the shorter and simplified first aid course called Self Help and Neighbor Help. Information on these are available at district health centers of the health department, which are located in all boroughs. Of course, all civil defense volunteers have received or will receive first aid training in addition to other instructions. In other words, you can't make it compulsory, which is what that letter suggested. That's correct. You can't do that. Another question on the same theme, and this letter says, why not organize first aid brigades on a group basis in various communities? Wouldn't this induce greater cooperation? The writer of this letter, I think, is confusing two facts about civil defense. If what he means by a first aid brigade is a first aid station, we are planning such facilities. If what he means is to induce people to take first aid courses so that they can help themselves or their immediate families in an emergency, that is something else. Certainly, all people ought to know how to provide simple first aid for themselves and their families. And, as I've said before, there are places to get this information. But I do not see how this aspect of first aid can be made anything more than voluntary. Well, maybe more demonstrations of first aid would help to arouse people to the real need for it. We have already had some public demonstrations of first aid stations. More are scheduled in the near future as additional groups are organized and trained. Here's a group of letters that are concerned with some specific aspects of first aid. Our first one says, I've heard about drinking a solution of salt and bicarbonate to treat shock. Is that really helpful? Yes, but of course, only if the patient is able to drink. The formula for this solution consists of two tablespoons of sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, three tablespoons of table salt in one gallon of water. The patient should be encouraged to drink liberally of this mixture. Another question, sir. Some people say we should put ointment on burns, and others say we should leave the burns dry. What's your advice? As in many other branches of medicine, medical opinion on the ideal treatment of burns is divided. Probably the best and simplest first aid treatment for burns is the application of a simple, clean dressing to the burned areas. This can consist of gauze, or if one is in the home, a clean towel or a clean handkerchief will suffice. In large burned areas, a fluffy material such as Turkish toweling should be placed over the gauze dressing, and then covered with a bandage applied snugly. The woman who wrote this letter is concerned about fractures, which she says are undoubtedly very common after an air raid. If no splints or boards are nearby, what should I do? The use of improvised splints in the emergency treatment of fractures is to be recommended as a first aid measure. If no splints or boards are handy, magazines, newspapers, broomsticks, or any other available rigid material may be used for emergency splinting purposes. Well, here's another question about specific injuries, and this one asks whether bits of glass should be removed from a cut before applying a bandage. Bits of glass or any other found body should never be removed from a wound by a first aid worker. The best plan is to apply a bandage or clean dressing and direct the injured person to medical care. Sir, would you advise that first aid materials such as gauze or towels or splints be stored now in a shelter? Yes, indeed. They should be handy around the house anyhow, not only for disaster emergency, but as a sensible precaution at all times. Here's a letter from a person who received Red Cross first aid training during the last war, and he wants to know if he is still qualified as a first aider. Standard Red Cross first aid certificates expire three years from the date of issuance and are renewable only through enrollment in and completion of another first aid course. The best plan for assisting in emergency first aid work is to immediately volunteer in whatever category of the public health or medical emergency division one is best suited for. Such volunteers will then be given intensive training in the preparation for an emergency. Thank you for being with us, Dr. Theodore Rosenthal, Assistant Commissioner for Medical Emergency Services of the Department of Health of the City of New York. Next week, Plan for Survival will present the first of four on-the-spot reports of the civil defense story. You'll hear the sounds and voices of civil defense workers in action with James Fleming as narrator. Try to be with us, won't you? Until then, this is Bill Leonard reminding you that civil defense is common sense. You have been listening to the 24th in a series of transcribed programs called Plan for Survival, brought to you over a special statewide emergency broadcasting network. Next week, our program will bring you the first of a series of on-the-spot reports with James Fleming as narrator. Meantime, we invite your comments on this series. Remember, the only address you need is Plan for Survival, Box 22, Murray Hill Station, New York 16. Be sure to listen at this same time next week. This is the Civil Defense Radio Network.
