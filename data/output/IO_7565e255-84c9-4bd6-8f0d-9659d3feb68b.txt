The radio's microphones are now in the council chamber in City Hall, and the occasion is the oath-taking ceremony of the Honorable Rudolph Halley, President-elect of the City Council of New York City. They have just made their entrance into the council chamber, and in just a few moments you'll hear the voice of Mr. David L. Schivitz, who will preside and present the regular Ottawa program. Mr. Schivitz. Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous flight, O'er the ramparts we watch were so gallantly streaming, and the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? Please remain standing while the invocation is offered by the Right Reverend Charles F. Boynton, Suffragan Bishop of New York. O God, the fountain of all wisdom, whose statutes are good and gracious, and whose law is truth, we beseech thee so to guide and bless this thy servant, Rudolph, here to be sworn into the weighty office of President of the City Council of the City of New York, that he may be obtain and ordain for our governance only such things as our right and pleasing to thee and to the welfare of the people of this city. Grant unto him, O Lord, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and ghostly strength, the spirit of knowledge and true godliness, that he may discern the truth and impartially administer the law in the law in the fear of the law in the fear of the law in the fear of the alone. In the time of prosperity, fill his heart with thankfulness, and in the day of trouble, suffer not his trust in thee to fail. All of which we ask of thee, O Father Almighty, world without end. Amen.

Mrs. LaGuardia is now presenting personally the gavel to Mr. Rudolph Halley. The Honorable Rudolph Halley, who has just been sworn in as President of the City Council of New York. Thank you, Marie. I regard this gavel as a symbol of dedication to public office, of complete integrity in public office, and of decent, honest, and efficient public administration by a fearless man. In holding this gavel, Marie, I will feel that I am holding the hopes and the aspirations of many millions of people, and certainly my own hopes and aspirations. On this occasion, I would like to say that having, by the people of New York City, and with the blessing and the aid of the Lord, undertaken the responsibilities of the Office of President of the City Council, it is appropriate that I publicly state my concept of the responsibility which I am accepting, and my concept of the dedication which I am making. I believe that we, people of New York City, have given me a mandate, a job to do, a job which I must do, and must do with all of my ability, and never shrinking from it, a job which has definite confines and limitations, and to which I should limit myself so that I can give all of my energies and activities to the task at hand. I believe that mandate is to use every effort within the legal, constitutional powers of my office, in cooperation with my colleagues in office, to bring about clean, decent, efficient municipal government. I believe that that means that I cannot please all of the people all of the time. It believes that I will have to have the courage to do that which is, in my opinion, right, after I have sought and carefully weighed expert advice and received the help of the many people upon whom I know I can count, and on whom I should say I know we, the people, can count for aid and assistance in this job. My election came after I had made a number of statements as to policy. Of these I will not be unmindful. They will always be in the forefront in every activity. And I shall construe this mandate to mean that I shall engage in activity as the independent who has been elected, turning neither to one side nor to the other, but serving all of the people faithfully throughout my term of office. And I thank those in this room, each and every one of you, on behalf of all of the people of the city of New York. Thank you. Dr. Israel Goldstein, Rabbi of Congregation B'nai Jeshrin, will pronounce the benediction. In the spirit of self-dedication to the high purposes with which these ceremonies are invested, we turn our hearts to the source of all inspiration. Thy spirit, O God, implanted in man, doth move him to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thee. Thy prophets have taught us that the measure of man's merit in thy sight is the extent of his concern with the well-being of his fellow men. Millions of thy creatures inhabit this huge and multi-complexioned metropolis. May our chosen leaders keep their minds and hearts attuned to the needs of the masses of the people. May they not hesitate to vent their cleansing wrath upon iniquity. May they bend their compassion to the weak and the underprivileged. May they devote their talents to the improvement of our city's manifold services to all its citizens. May they bend their compassion to the people, upon him who this day assumes high office, an office to which he was elected by the people. May his vision of a community cleansed of its dross be matched by zeal of performance. May he be granted health and strength to endure the strain of public office. May he be granted health and strength to endure the pain of his death. May he be granted health and strength to endure the pain of his death. May he случае days to endure the pain of his death with the obstacles which may obstruct his path, May he be Tuskka who deserve his strength and strength to protect himself from your father's people, May he move them that day his meglio… May he يتions with hisuncias May he step the ways to tutto his part May he Barber ever higher goals for the progress of our community. Thy blessing, O gods, bestow upon all who carry public responsibilities in our city, state, and nation. May peace reign within our borders and flow from our borders like a torrent to all parts of this strife-torn world. Establish thou, O Lord, the work of our hands. The work of our hands do thou establish. The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord cause his spirit to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his spirit upon thee and grant thee peace. Amen. If you will all remain seated, Mr. Halley will receive those who wish to do so in his offices downstairs. But I would like you to remain seated until the members of the Board of Estimates, the council, can go leave the room. Radio's microphones this morning have brought you the oath-taking ceremony of the Honorable Rudolph Halley, who has just been sworn in as president of the City Council of the City of New York. Mr. Halley is now leaving the council chamber and is going to his own offices on the first floor of City Hall on the east end of City Hall, where, as Mr. Schibert has just announced, he will receive the guests and friends who have come here this morning to greet him and wish him success in his new undertaking. He is now escorted by the Board of Estimates and the members of the City Council as they leave the council chamber in City Hall. That is all we have to report from City Hall. We return you now to our studios. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
