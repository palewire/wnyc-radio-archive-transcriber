Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Your services for mankind. Thank you, Mr. President. Mayor Impelitari is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and bowing and bowing and bowing and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Vittorio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. The mayor of Genoa. The mayor of Genoa. The mayor of Genoa. I have the words affectionate and cordial, to my modest person and to my noble city, which I have the honor to represent. There are facts and acts that make men and every act that man makes a unique meaning, but there are acts that make a unique meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, came to Europe and came to my city, she did not have only made a cordial visit to all of us. She also made an homage to the city-mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent to the recognition of the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is also a Genova ambasciatore of democracy, of that democracy that is so expensive to men of the United States, but that is so expensive to be expensive to be used to the Italians, and the Genovese, especially. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, and so every citizen of America, independent of its origin and social class, she can come to come she has been able to come to come to the city-mother of the United States. So this is my visit, this is not only a response, this is not only a response, this is not only a courtesy of Hon. Impiniteri, this is my visit, It is not only a courtesy of the people of cockpit, but it is awesome, is not the opposite of a man who roots into the new democratic democracy, and that has contributed modestly to reconstitue it, it is a salute of this man and of the Italian population to the great people of the United States, to the United States, which we are deeply grateful, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to rid ourselves of democratic libertarian when he intervened so potent in the war and to protect them today with many material sacrifices and of men also, so today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently to defend democracy in Europe and in all the world. Well, the Hon. Impeliteri, the Hon. Sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work because the democratic freedom will be really extended to everyone and there will be peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For some time we Italians don't understand it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just a moment in which we were gravating from the weight of the conflict. We have lost the power of the city and we have lost the territory in which our work could be to exploit themselves. We were miserable and the ruin but the power of this power, this power of this democratic freedom was so alive that we have taken our work. We have worked. weMichael who is tons of Prop Cecilia who does이�se contributions I am tenacious in the work of reconstruction of democracy in our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in looking for your own land is an example to all the genoveses. Derisier, not credier, contrasting by every man and the events of every man, this man knew that this big land exists and looked at it desperately. He went through the mountains and the mountains, and looked at it everywhere, and looked at it wherever he wanted to find the passage he wanted to join the world under the Christian cross. Well, it doesn't matter if he then finds the passage. It doesn't matter if we don't find the passage. If there is to persist, others will find the way. The way to make everyone free, in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great man which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. Thanks, sir. As always, bolster. division. Lt. Inc. Sسب. Nick Post22 S agent. Every little manina, there's the very first day. Every street signorina, said it the very same way. These funny little words don't really mean a thing.

O si, o tra la la. If the ladies should ask you if you care, you don't have a start, a love affair, say, O si, o tra la la. Does it mean yes or no? Does it mean no? Well, yes and no, cause see, o tra la la. Get together and sing, tra la la la. But it's easy to say, so try today. And raise the snake on the sea, come on, stop. O si, o tra la la. O si, o tra la la.
