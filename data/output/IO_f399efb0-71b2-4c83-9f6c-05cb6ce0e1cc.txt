Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. I don't know. The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The National Anthem of Italy and the National Anthem of our own country, very brightly played by the New York City Police Department Band. Now here is Mr. Coleman. Yes. Mayor Impoletari, it is my distinct honor and privilege today to present to you and through you, the people of the City of New York, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of Genoa, Italy. Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The Mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. when he was elected mayor of Genoa last year. He defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success and when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scarnie of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And, Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor the City's Gold Medal of Honor on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome looking man accepting the congratulations of the Mayor and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Pertuzio is about six feet two I would say weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. Honorable Honorable Sindaco of New York of New York is with profound commotion that I heard invest in their I have made the facts and the acts that men have a unique meaning. But there are some acts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Europe and is coming to my city, she has not only made a visit of cordiality, but she has also made a visit to our city of Cristoforo Colombo and this is what he has been sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is also come to Genova and is also a democracy, that is so expensive to the people of the United States, but so expensive to the Italians, especially to the Genovese. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States and so every citizen American, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come to the city, as she has been able to represent the city. So, this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and his mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is also a statement of the people of America who belong to the new democratic democratic democratic democratic and has contributed to the purpose of the country. This visit is the salute of this people of the United States and the people of the United States, the great people of the United States, which we are deeply grateful for the people of America because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made that this people have made up to us, to rid us of democratic democratic freedom when we have intervened so potent in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men and also to protect them. So, today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocini of democracy and have operated intelligently because we have to defend the democracy in Europe and really defend the democracy in the world and defend it in the world. And, onorevole Impeliteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work in this faith because the democratic democratic freedom is really estetic to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. Forse, sometimes, we Italians don't understand. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just in the moment when we were we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We were lost in the city of the city. We were lost in the city of the city in which our work could be exploited. We were lost in the city of the city but the power of this power, this power of this democratic democratic freedom was so vive that we had to take care of our work. We worked, we worked, we worked, we worked for the whole community and to make it work and to make it a better way our country. And with these sentiments, onorevole Impeliteri, I salute you and the city of New York and I tell you that we are tenacious in our work of la democracy in our country. We are tenacious and we are examples We have examples of the example of Genova. The tenacity of Colombo in search of your land is an example of all the genoveses. Very serious. Tolong family. and he looked for it desperately, and he went to the river, and he went to the river, and he went to the estuary, everywhere, looking for the passage that he wanted to find for all the world under the cross, and not matter if he then didn't find the passage, not matter if each one of us doesn't find the passage, if he had to persist, others will find the way, the way so that everyone is free, in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York, and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for, and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy, with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great man which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. Let's go. We'll. The holidays, the Italians love to sing. O-si-co-sa.
