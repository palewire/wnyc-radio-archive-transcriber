Here's to veterans from the Jack Parr program with Jerry Fielding and the orchestra, yours truly, High Aberbeck, and starring America's new young humorist, Jack Parr. Here's to veterans, a fast-moving quarter hour of entertainment and helpful information brought to you transcribed by the top flight talent of radio in cooperation with the Veterans Administration, dedicated to the citizens who served in our armed forces, now working shoulder to shoulder with their fellow Americans to make a stronger and better America for us all. And here he is, the star of this edition of Here's to Veterans, Jack Parr. Thank you, this is Jack Parr. Before we get on with our salute to all you ex-service guys and gals, I'd like to tell you a story about an ex-CB named Phil who got that very common notion in his head, why not start a business of my own? Phil was sitting on a bench one day waiting for a bus. He sized up an attractive advertising message he saw painted on the bench and that did it. He figured out costs and risks, checked his proposition with some shrewd businessmen, and finally took his plans to a bank. The bank came through with a GI loan. The Veterans Administration added its long guarantee, and now when Phil says, good morning boss, he's talking to himself. He owns a paint sprayer, a truck, and a flock of sturdy benches. There are two guys on Phil's payroll now, and he has some profitable advertising contracts and is digging for more. Headaches? Sure, but he's paying his bills on time and the future looks bright. Thanks to Congress, a smart banker, the Veterans Administration, and the determination of careful planning and the know-how of a former CB named Phil. Friends, did you know that a recent radio survey showed that one out of every three people in the United States is now a disc jockey? As a result of this disc jockey epidemic, our country's been turning into a nation of record fans. How will this affect the next generation? Will the kids of the future be born with holes in their heads? Will their mothers transcribe them for release at a more convenient bedtime? And will large families come in albums? The disc jockey is a product of today, which is one of the few things our ancestors can be thankful for. Say, how about that? If there had been radio in the days of our ancestors, would they have had disc jockeys? Here's how it would sound if there had been radio a hundred years ago. And so we conclude another chapter in the true life story of Renée Latouche, Girl Candlesnuffer. The story of one girl's struggle with Louis XIV. We urge you, one and all, monsieur, madame, and peasants, to tune in again tomorrow at the same time. And now loyal subjects of the king, here is your favorite disc jockey. The show that does the Epcats jumping from Marseille to Mobile, Jacques Pars Platter-Perez. Hail and for... Hail and forsooth, gang. This is your favorite knave, Jacques Pie, with another solid record show. Yay and barely, cats, we're really going to have a time tonight. All new releases, we're going to have, we're going to, uh, back in the Bach, chop some Chopin, and poo-poo some Paganini. And later on, as our guest tonight, we're going to have Franz Schubat, whom we all know as Frankie, Tonight we're going to have Franz Schubed, whom we all know as Frankie Boy. By the way, serfs, this is the first quarter hour, brought to you by Honest Pierre, the used horse dealer. Friends, are you still riding around on last year's horse? Well, Honest Pierre has just received a shipment of brand new horses with such outstanding features as white sidewall horseshoes and rear vision saddle. All prices are FOB Arabia. And now catch... And now catch our first record. It's a new little ditty by Wolfgang Mozart, and Wolfie tells me it really jumps. Yea, verily, it's groovy. Head is recorded by Sergai Lombardo, the sweetest music this side of Hanover. All right, Sergai. Thank you, Sergai Lombardo. Thank you, Sergai Lombardo. Thank you. Thank you, Sir Guy Lombardo. By the way, kids, that was Popsy Schneerbaum on the first flugelhorn. Incidentally, that number was played before Igor, Boris, Ivan, and all the gang over at the Siberian Salt Mines. And the next quarter hour is brought to you by the Acme Powdered Wig Company. So now comes a bit of a transcription. Good news from the Acme Powdered Wig Company, makers of fine wigs for over 2,000 heads. Yes, Acme wigs now come in three convenient sizes. Long, very long, and... Hey, who turned out the lights? So, buy an Acme wig today, and soon all your friends will be saying... She's lovely, she's engaged, she's bald. Ah, yes, good old Acme Powdered Wigs. No foolin', Violets. Acme wigs are so realistic, even dandruff can't tell the difference. And now back to the record rack, and we have for you a brand new pop tune, Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. This, of course, was written by that popular young composer, Ludwig von Beethoven. Nice going, lud. We're going to hear this new symphony recorded by that young musical nobleman, Count Spike de la Jones. Spike has arranged this symphony for two oboes and a water hydrant. All right, here we go. Beethoven's Fifth, recorded by Count Spike de la Jones and his orchestra, and I'll be back with you in just a minuet. All right. Gadzooks, that was really solid, Gates. And now, cats gather round, it's time for our special guest. Here he is, that solid-sending scribbler of songs, Franz Unfinished Symphony Schubet. Come in, Franz. It's nice having you with us. Thank you. It gives me real kicks to be here with you, solid cats. Ach, du Wouterini! And it's good digging you again, Franz. What have you been doing with yourself? Oh, the same thing I've been doing for years. Trying to finish that darn thing. Well, Franz, tell us, isn't it true that you wrote a symphony at the age of three? Yeah, yeah. Just think, a complete symphony at the age of three. It's amazing. What's so amazing? It was lousy. But it's still so unbelievable, a three-year-old child writing an entire symphony. There was nothing else to do. I was too young to go with girls. I'll bet you wrote that symphony on three-cornered sheet music, maybe, huh? Tell me, Franz, is it true that a lot of your work has been influenced by Ludwig von Beethoven? Pa, are you choking? Ludwig von Beethoven, Dutchmo, influenced me? Take it easy, Frankie. I can't help it. All the time I'm hearing this, but there's influence, influence. And what does this Beethoven bombe write, anyway? Symphonies, symphonies, nothing but symphonies. Like that fifth symphony of his. Da-da-da-da! That's music, da-da-da-da! That's knocking on the door, Richard! I'm so mad at this man, I could kill him. I could scream! I could scream! Believe me, he did not influence me. Franz, I think you've got bats in your Beethoven, I do. Look, there's something else I want to ask you. Is there any truth to the swing-alley talk that you're forming a new hot trio? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We are going to call ourselves Franz Schubert und his Wiener Schnitzel 3. Wiener Schnitzel 3, the boys jump? Jump? Believe me, strictly wunderbar, well, Rene. We got Johannes Brahms on the cello, good boy, that Johnny. And, uh, uh, on the harpsichord, we got Franz Liszt, also a good man. And once he played with Beethoven. Beethoven, he did not influence me. He did not influence me. And on the violin is me, also a good man. I'm sure of that, Franz, and I'm going to put a plug in here for you right now. By the way, cats, the Wiener Schnitzel 3 is available for picnics, weddings, and guillotine parties. How's that, Franz? Absolutely sooty. But I think you might also mention the trio opens Saturday night at the sign of the old Boar's Head Inn. Oh, yes, that place right next door to the sign of the, you know, vacancy. Did you get all that, cats? Let's really turn out Saturday and give Franz and the boys a great... Excuse me, Jacques, madame, monsieur, and peasants. We must interrupt this broadcast for urgent news. The palace guards have just overthrown the king. The annual spring revolution is now officially underway. Sorry, platter fans. Due to circumstances beyond our control, this program will now come to you from a more convenient country. A while back, I told you about a veteran who got a bright idea while waiting for a bus and came up with a business of his own. I wonder if you realize the importance of the time and everything that veteran did. First, he looked carefully into the matter of whether the time was good or bad to start a small business on limited capital. Then, after he'd figured out costs, he checked his figures with expert businessmen. More time saved. Next, knowing that the Veterans Administration cannot make a GI loan, he went directly to the bank for his. Strike out more wasted hours. He was careful to bring with him his original discharge papers. That saved him an extra trip. The bank took care of his VA loan guarantee. More hours and minutes on the proper side of the ledger. Yes, by knowing what to do and doing it properly, he took the straight road toward profitable citizenship. The goal Congress had in mind when it passed the GI Bill. And that's the Here's to Veterans Tribute from Jack Parr, Jerry Fielding and his orchestra, and yours truly, High Aberback, who with our sponsors, the American Federation of Radio Artists, the American Federation of Musicians, the Advertising Council, and this station have donated their services and time to the Veterans Administration as a public service. Tune in again for another star-studded Here's to Veterans show. And veterans, for advice and help on your insurance, education, loans, medical care, and other benefits, ride or visit your nearest Veterans Administration office. Remember, a well-adjusted veteran means a happier and more prosperous America. And now, a word from your local announcer. musicяч mostly golpards and taxed payloads and play 플러�폐 along those Straßen and mine on those constraints but not to forget. The End Here's to veterans from the King Cole Trio. The End Here's to veterans tribute show, the King Cole Trio's guest is Woody Herman. Woody, it's a pleasure to say welcome to King Cole Trio time.

Naughty Angeline. Naughty Angeline. Angela. Angela. Veterans, let me tell you about an ex-paratrooper named Paul. Paul wasn't happy about the jump he'd made from the Army into a civilian job as a shipping clerk's helper. So he went to his nearest VA office for advice. Said, Paul, I want to do something better than baby-minding a bunch of boxes and barrels. How about it? Well, the VA sent him to another office where they had advisement and guidance people. Paul's very first interview showed mechanical aptitude to a high degree. Next came general educational tests, five in a row. Although he was a bit nervous, he ran up five excellent scores. Before you could say Geronimo, the VA recommended Paul for a high school diploma. Later came a special aptitude test for college engineering. And now he's in college making swell grades in electrical engineering. That's the way Congress intended its program of education and training for veterans to work. And it will work by pointing the way to profitable citizenship for those who really have the stuff. Write or visit your nearest VA office for complete information. Now back to King Cole Trio time for more music. The cream of the top pop crop. Brought to us by the King Cole Trio in person. Oscar Moore with the guitar, Johnny Miller on the bass, and Nat King Cole himself playing at the piano and singing out the song. The song will be another request by our guest, Woody Herman. We're listening, Woody. You know, this is more fun than picking horses. It's more economical, too. King Cole, I'd like to hear you and Oscar and Johnny do a job on one of the new ballads. It sounds kind of special to me, and I know you boys will make it sound even better. It's called Ask Anyone Who Knows. Nat. There is no shore without an ocean. Ask anyone who knows. There is no love without devotion. Ask anyone who knows. A dream will stray and lose its way. If it can't come true. Night and day, all my dreams Are so dependent on you A sigh can mean a sweet beginning Ask anyone who knows It's love that keeps the whole world spinning Ask anyone who knows Ask anyone who knows I have no heart when we're apart It leaves me when you go It leaves me when you go It leaves me when you go And darling, if you don't believe me Ask anyone who knows Ask anyone who knows Ask anyone who knows Ask anyone who knows Thank you. Have you been enjoying yourself, Woody? Oh, naturally. I'm having a ball. Well, how'd you like to go to work? Well, I knew there'd be a catch somewhere. Well, it's your own fault, Woody. You do such a swell job on your latest recording, words get around, you know. And right now, we'd like our listeners to hear the job you do on that leaky faucet song, and it's called Blue Bleep. Well, I'm gone, so turn on the music, Nat. We gone. Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep. Bleep. The faucet keeps it ripping, and I can't sleep. Bloop. Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep. I guess I never should have ordered clam soup. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. I wonder where to go to buy a car cheap. Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep. What is it with the babe next door? What is it she does to me? What mad kind of thrill do I find? Looking at her walking, just walking by. Don't know I'm alive, and she's driving me out of my... Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep. Bleep. Bloop. Bloop. Bloop. Bloop. Bleep. Bloop. Bleep bleep. Bloop. Bleep. The faucet keeps it ripping and I just can't sleep. Oh man, I can't make it. I just gotta get me a plumber. Bleep. Thank you, Woody Herman. A while ago, I told you fellas about the paratrooper who made a nervy jump from a routine shipping clerk job to a college course in electrical engineering. Of course, there's more to it than just being sick of a routine job. What was it that made Paul click all along the line? Well, he had basic abilities to make good and big time competition. He took full advantage of the services offered by the Veterans Administration, including the special counseling furnished by the VA's advisement and guidance people. He had the courage and perseverance to keep his nose to the grindstone till he achieved what he was after. And there you have it. Congress provides the educational benefits. The VA can help you use them wisely, but the real driving force must come from you, the veteran. It's up to you to turn opportunity into worthwhile citizenship. Incidentally, if you veterans in college want to get your subsistence checks on time, be sure your school has notified the VA that you are enrolled. It's time for another trio treatment. The tune to be selected by our guest, Woody Herman. Well, this time, Dick, I've selected something really special. That song about Aunt Hetty. Who? Aunt Hetty. She's all the rage in England, you know. She likes jazz, but she doesn't like music. I don't get it. I think you will when you hear the song. You know about Aunt Hetty, don't you, Nat? Oh, sure. She likes mill and more, but she doesn't like coal. Uh-huh. You got it. Tell me about her, too, will you, fellas? I don't get this. I think you will, Dick, as we go along. Come on, fellas. Aunt Hetty likes kittens, but she don't like cats. Aunt Hetty likes bonnets, but she don't like hats. Aunt Hetty likes beetles, but she don't like bugs. Aunt Hetty likes kisses, but she don't like hugs. If you don't understand this game, we'll give you some clues. Aunt Hetty only likes those little words where the letters come in twos. Aunt Hetty likes gossip, but she don't like news. Aunt Hetty likes boogies, but she don't like the blues. So, when it comes to the blues, you build them out. Aunt hetty likesисл Speaker 2, but she doesn't like the blues. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
