This is Al Jolson. Some of you have seen the story of my life on the screen. Well, it's one of those stories with a happy ending. But have you ever stopped to think how many life stories do end happily? In this great city where I've spent a good part of my life, I've seen tragedy all around me. And yet so much of it, mental and physical alike, can be eliminated. The Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York worked night and day through its vast network of hospitals, medical and social welfare agencies to ease the suffering of New Yorkers of all ages, all races, all religions.

The other day I was allowed to watch an operation of the famous New York Hospital. And I saw with my own eyes something we all seem to take for granted. The exacting skill. The wordless confidence. The miracle of medicine. Modern surgery. Yet even as I learned of this great triumph, I also learned the tragic fact about thousands of our neighbors who are denied medical care. They're denied this medical care because of lack of hospital beds. Scarcity of nurses. No funds available to replace outmoded equipment. The Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, which supports ten great hospitals as well as other medical and social welfare agencies, is now embarked on a great Building Fund Programme.

The director of the Home for the Aged watches the old woman ease her weary body into the chair. He knows what's coming. My children are dead. Now I'm living alone in a furnished room. They told me to see you, that here in this place all people like me can stay. This is a home for the aged, Mrs. Gross, but we have no room for you now. There's a waiting list of 650. I'm sorry, Mrs. Gross. But can't you give me just a corner someplace, even a bed in the hallway? The director shakes his head.

To help these children, the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York plans to expand its child care work through a great building fund program now underway.
