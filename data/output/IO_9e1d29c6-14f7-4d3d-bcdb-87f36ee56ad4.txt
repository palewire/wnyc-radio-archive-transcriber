Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to call your attention to the fact that we're about to start the regular order of programs. Commissioner Mustard of the Department of Health and the Mayor of the City of New York are on their way here. It seems like only a few weeks back, or a few months at best, that the cornerstone ceremonies of this wonderful health center were the occasion at that time here in Brownsville. And today we see this magnificent building. And now while we're waiting for the Commissioner of the Department of Health, Dr. Mustard, Dr. Frant will take over and act as chairman until such time as Commissioner Mustard and the Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, arrives. Dr. Frant. Honored clergy, guests, ladies and gentlemen, it's a great privilege to stand here before you and act until Dr. Mustard, the Commissioner of Health, comes in introducing those parts of the program which will take place before the Mayor gives his speech. Dr. Frant. I now take great pleasure in introducing the Reverend Boyd S. Gent of the Tabernacle Baptist Church, who will give us the invocation. Reverend Gent. Oh God, our Father, who maketh Thyself known in the stillness, let us feel Thy presence on this occasion. We thank Thee for this great building, this life-sustaining institution, whose health-beneficent rays of prevention as well as cure, shall shine forth to bless Thy children of all races and creeds. We thank Thee for the Mayor of our great city, under whose administration this building was planned and carried out to its completion. We thank Thee for our Burr President, who helped to make this building a reality, and for the great number of civic leaders here in Brownsville and East New York and Kenoshe, who have led on in the fight to establish the needs, and for those who worked with them and can now rejoice in the future. Bless him who shall head this health center and all of us in the future. bless him who shall come here for advice and treatment of mind and body. Come this way, Lord, I thank Thee for 타 layouts of the여x dr Mint and WestCT.

If you will please keep standing, we will now have the Star-Spangled Banner by the Police Bleed Club. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. of the program, which is going to be very hard for me as deputy for Dr. Mustard to fill. In the first place, Dr. Mustard is coming, and therefore he will have remarks. In the second place, there will be other people with remarks. There are only a certain number of facts connected with the health building that we have in front of us, and I have to be very careful not to give you any of these facts before the speakers who have them all listed are going to give them to you. So that, as I said, it's quite hard to know just what to say in place of Dr. Mustard at this time. I can say to you, however, that one of the primary objects of the health department which Dr. Mustard so gloriously heads, one of the objectives is to have centers such as this building all over the city of New York. And when you go inside and see our building here, you too will be proud of the work that we can do for the people of the city of New York. In these buildings, as you know, are the administrative offices of the district personnel and the clinics and services which take care of the local needs. These buildings are ones to which you should come for help and ones where we will be glad to help you. With those introductory remarks, which as you note don't tell you anything much about how much the building costs and so forth, I should like to introduce some of the people of Brooklyn and some of the people of this district who have been most enthusiastic about helping the health department's programs. They won't be in order of importance because all of them are important. But I do want to say that when we come to the end, we have a very important person, namely your borough president. And I'll start off now with Mr. Alfred A. Lama, Assemblyman. Will you rise, Mr. Lama? Honorable Hyman Shorenstein, former commissioner of records. Honorable William Rosenblatt, state senator. Honorable John J. Lynch, commissioner of borough of work. Honorable William Rosenblatt, senator senator. Honorable William Rosenblatt. Honorable William Rosenblatt, senator. hon. i. Foran. Mr. Heron is here for Mr. Sin пожar. Mr. Jacob Wraller, secretary of congressman, seller. Mr. H. Gott. And as I am not a Brooklynite, I know there are more here, and I wonder whether I can impose I can impose on Mr. Lynch maybe to tell me the names of a few other distinguished guests. Commissioner Leavitt of the Market Department. Magistrate Joe Nice, formerly of the Market Department. Assemblyman Anthony Trutter. Former United States Marshal James M. Power. The Reverend George Keith Roman. Judge Harry Eppett. Miss Beedie Markowitz. Mrs. Helena Spurdy. Mrs. Anne Brodsky. Mrs. Louise Haslam. I know these ladies, but I don't know their names. Mrs. Anne Brodsky. And all the other people in this community who, by their efforts, made this building possible. And now, I want to introduce the Honorable John Cashmore, President of the Borough of Brooklyn. Reverend clergy, Dr. Frank, distinguished guests, friends and neighbors of what we call the greatest city's greatest borough, the Borough of Brooklyn. But you and I realize that Brooklyn is only one of the five boroughs. I'm going to try and break this down for you in very, very simple language. The budget of the city of New York is $1,197,000,000. And when you, as the chief magistrate of this city, have a budget of that size, you know you're going to be criticized at times by some of the newspapers. But there's another side to a budget of $1,197,000,000. And as you look up here and you see this building, you and I know that it costs money. It's $875,000,000. That's a lot of money. And you may be tempted with an appropriation like that to say, let's put it off for a few years and maybe the prices will come down. But you and I also know that the youngsters won't wait. They have to grow up. You and I know that there's a saying nobody knows who invented it. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. And when you go into this building, down into the basement, you'll see an auditorium that can be used to educate the mothers and the youngsters of this community that comprises almost 300,000 people. And then you go up onto the first floor, you'll see the administrative staff and their offices. And in the very rear of this building, you'll see a dental laboratory that you'll find no better equipment anywhere else in the world. In fact, it's a pleasure to have your teeth taken out. I said that to see how far my voice was carrying. Now, let's take a look at what really happened. In the year 1833, there was a young man who worked in the patent office down in Washington. And he wrote a letter of resignation in which he said he was a conscientious man and he felt that nothing else could be invented that would add to human mankind. And therefore, he was turning in his resignation. That was the year 1833. How fortunate this country was that we didn't have many men like that. Because when you consider that while war brings out men who are destructors of the human race, we still have humanitarians who can take and discover a little germ like microbes and the tuberculous germ. And then we realized that in those days it was killing one out of seven people. And today we have it practically conquered through the invention of penicillin and streptomycin. Now, it isn't very easy to be faced with a budget like this. But it is easy for the man who has led this city for three and a half years. A quarter of a century ago, he was a young cop. And being a young cop on the police force of the city, he had many chores in the day and a great many at night. And he come to know the needs and the wants of the people and especially the youngsters. The youngster, unless somebody helps them, will always strike out. He knew the youngster who didn't have good vision, who needed eyeglasses. Here he can be taken care of. He knew the youngster whose teeth were so badly gone that for the rest of his life he was going to have that tremendous handicap. Here that youngster can be taken care of. He knew of the unfortunate boy or girl who had a disease that will break down the brain and the mind. Here that boy or girl can be taken care of. He knew of the young couple who was going to have a youngster in their family. Over the years of the newborns from John H.awareatra,�andak.car He knew that wasn't the fact parodinkansen Henrich. He now even fell in the fare spot. Period your own clips. Now I would seem to ask you the last two hours a week. Roger on launched his進行 hunt. He told us about. He didn't miss that all.
