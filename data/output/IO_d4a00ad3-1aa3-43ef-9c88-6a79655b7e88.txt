Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We greet you from our studios high atop the municipal building where we are about to witness the completion of a project to modernize and streamline your city station. Eighteen months ago, we dedicated our new equipment and studios. Tonight, we celebrate the final touches, the acceptance of the murals and sculptures presented to this station by the Federal Art Project of the City of New York, marking the completion of this unusual undertaking. We hope to convey to you some of the pleasure we are enjoying in the formal presentation of these beautiful works. And although we use the term formal, in order to make this occasion a bright one for you as well as for ourselves, we have asked Ezra McIntosh, better known to you perhaps as the voice of the theater, to introduce informally the interesting personalities who are with us here and make this a festive evening rather than a formal one. But before getting along with Mr. McIntosh, our maestro Macklin Morrow stands before the WNYC Concert Orchestra. His baton is raised as they are about to play the scherzo from William Grant Still's Afro-American Symphony.TERM 양 MICHAEL ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ � link to the ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ to the elite. The common man in the street was able to see what the common artist of the street was able to depict and to enjoy and like it. I am here today to make an especial plea for the cooperation between the architect, the muralist, and the sculptor. We have been perhaps friendly enemies, but very widely apart in our handling of the problem of creative design in large forms. The architect has gone his way, the muralist his, and the sculptor has also taken a different path. In fact, there has been so little cooperation between them that when a building is erected and decorated, sometimes the mural artist and the sculptor do not even know what was in the architect's mind or he in theirs. And we find modern buildings with classical and extremely reactionary decorations in them. We find very old-fashioned buildings with extremely modern decorations in them as, for example, the very building in which these magnificent murals have been placed in our own large municipal government building. It seems to me that the time has come when architects and sculptors and sculptors and painters should recognize that they are each one arm, a sort of a three-armed creation of one and the same aesthetic idealism. And when they will have gotten together sufficiently to be able to express in a unified way the things that they feel in common, when the architectural structure will be so arranged that no one will be able to realize where the structure ends, where the sculptor introduces the planes of light and dark that create the shadows in his building, and where the muralist adds that color to both the form created by the architect and the shades and shadows created by the sculptor, that the building becomes an integral whole, we will have reached some stage in the development of modern art that in very ancient times was considered the acne of perfection. Thank you very much, Mr. Shade, and we hope that time will not be long hence. It's a great deal of fun to talk like this, but there's hardly a conversation that won't be just as enjoyable after some really fine music. Every eye is fastened on Maestro Marrow's baton and what's he going to play, Mr. Elliott?
