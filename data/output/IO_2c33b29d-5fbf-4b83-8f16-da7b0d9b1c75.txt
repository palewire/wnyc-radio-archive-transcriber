The Glee Club sings next a medley of Welsh folk songs, the Glee Club sings next a medley of Welsh folk songs, the Glee Club sings next a medley of Welsh folk songs. The Glee Club sings next a medley of Welsh folk songs, Long thy ruin's soul, the day is shattered down, and broken heart, long recall the woeful might. All thy strength shall never burn, never shall thy dreams return. The fessence i shall pig for praise for thee. Long thy ruin's cold darauf ing, Aades Ch espero. In the hollow, do ye hear like rushing billows? Wave on wave, and surging fall off, as all is this found. Hear the tramples, Saxon-Fomen, Saxon-Fearman, Saxon-Fomen. Be they night, or hide, or yaw, and play the white background. Through the fall of thunder, flag we conquer under. The flag that drives our flag, nor the law is all in thunder. The world where the country needs us, he is brave as he who leads us. Honor sells how proud he has done. Freedom, love, and rise. Froggy thieves and glasses narrow, flash with fear and slight of harrow. Fluid danger of death or sorrow, death is glory now. Earl, a reeling, heart, men, o'er, let the earth, gentlemen, cover. In a friend, a wife, a lover, tremble on the floor. Hands of life are risen, love for love is given. Freedom, love, and rise. For their third and concluding number, the Glee Club presents Benny Havens, a ballad sung by Sons of West Point for over a hundred years, and sung today wherever West Pointers gather. Come fill your glasses, fellows, and stand up in the row. To singing sentimentality, we're going far to go. In the army there so dry at sea, from motion very slow. So we'll sing our grand Millicenters of Benny Havens, of Benny Havens, of Benny Havens, of Benny Havens, of Benny Havens, to our kind old alma mater, our rock-bound highland home. We'll cast back many upon regret, as for life's feet we roam. Until on our last battle's pierce, the lights of heaven shall flow. Till on our last battle's pierce, the lights of heaven shall flow. Till on our last battle's pierce, the lights of heaven shall flow. And Benny Havens, of Benny Havens, of Benny Havens, of Benny Havens, to our last battle's pierce, the lights of heaven shall flow. May the army be augmented, so more guns be let flow. May our country in the hour of peace be ready for the fall. May the time of those who let you face me of those who flow. We're strobing love, peace, I heart, say. May the time of many events, the players of Benny Havens, of Benny Havens, of Benny Havens, of Benny Havens, of Benny Havens. and yet then said a penny haven from West Point we conclude this quarter hour of song by the Cadet Glee Club conducted by Cadet G.
