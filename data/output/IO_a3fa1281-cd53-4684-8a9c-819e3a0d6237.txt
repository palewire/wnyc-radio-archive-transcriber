He was soldier boy on marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on now, sound, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft eyes of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, it won't be long, we're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, hooray. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I've hunder, wondering, darling, is your true.

It's the time we do, and the harvest days are over, just be near, and the harvest days are over, and the harvest days are over, and the harvest days are over.

But you love me, but not me, I think so good for you. When you hear the rest of the things in me, for joy, love, and praise the U.S. sing. And when the birds stand through, in the forest of the night, there will be a hot night, you'll come tonight.
