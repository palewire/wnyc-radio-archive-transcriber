O God, O ye faithful, joyful and joy of mine, Stabbing, O stabbing to heaven. Come to redeem us, we host the King of Angels. To the bread of the Lord is Christ alone. Sing, Father, and heaven. Sing in hallelujah. Sing, even, and the Lord of heaven. Glory to God, all glory in the highest. Sing, even, and the Lord of heaven. So come, let us adore Him. Christ alone. Sing, Lord of heaven. The Lord of heaven. Sing, Lord of heaven. Sing, Lord of heaven. Sing, Lord of heaven. Sing, Lord of heaven. Sing, Lord of heaven. CHOIR SINGS To the Lord.
