The ancient land of Palestine, the cradle of religion as we know it in the modern world, the Old and the New Testament, forms a contact with the equally ancient city of New York, but not quite so ancient in the history of things, when the mayor of Tel Aviv, Mr. Israel Rocha, is received today by the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer. Mr. Whelan is now just discussing a few preliminaries, and in a few moments when our guests are seated, you'll hear the familiar voice of Mr. Groveray Whelan, who generally escorts our guests. And now Mr. Whelan. The police police club will render the star-spying Obama. Oh! Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming. Both cross-stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched Was so gallantly streaming And the rockets there glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the ramparts we watched Palestine National Anthem Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the ramparts we watched The ramparts we watched A inlexio, Zofio Odlovto, tic vosellu A tic vò, hanu shòmò Lo shub l'eret avosellu Lo irvò, lo vittò mò Lo shub l'eret avosellu Lo irvò, lo vittò mò Mr. Mayor, may I ask the President of the Jewish National Fund of America, Judge Morris Rothenberg, to present the Mayor of Tel Aviv. Judge Rothenberg. Judge Rothenberg. Judge Rothenberg. To you at this time, his honor, the Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Distinguished guests. Most distinguished guests. Guests. Guests that we have been reading about and sympathizing with for so long. How can I adequately express the welcome of New York City to all three of you? To Mr. To Mr. His honor, the Mayor of Tel Aviv. To his sweet lady. And to Mr. Hartsfeld. You know, Mr. Mayor, you and I have our troubles. Mr. Mayor. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. We had hoped that when the day would come, that we would have the privilege to welcome you, sir. That we'd meet you at the Battery that's down here a ways, and bring you up to City Hall along in one of the most celebrated visits in the history of the city. And we planned it. We hoped that it would happen that way. And now see what happened. However, I have a great privilege and a pleasure to extend the official greetings of the city of New York to you, our most distinguished visitors, to the Honorable Mayor Rocha, Mayor of Tel Aviv, who, by all the standards, is one of the outstanding personalities of the greatest urban center of Jewish Palestine today. And to you, Mrs. Rocha, and to you, Mr. Hartsfeld, a very hearty welcome to our city. I am especially happy to welcome you, Mayor Rocha, at this friendly season of the year. Although, we'll have to eliminate the snowfall of the other day from that consideration. It is still in that spirit of friendship that we welcome you, a time which provides joyous expression to the spirit of brotherhood and brings into focus the realization that we all have a common bond in the service of humanity. This bond of fellowship is an indelible influence in the lives of Americans, and particularly New Yorkers, who are representative of so many fates and so many national extractions. I can't think of a better demonstration of this feeling than the message of goodwill and friendship that was sent to leaders of the Roman Catholic and Protestant faiths at Christmas by the Synagogue Council of America, issued in behalf of all the rabbis and synagogues in the United States. I would like to quote part of that message which I feel symbolizes the spirit to which I refer. Quote, It has been one of the heartening manifestations of goodwill between our respective fates that Christian leaders have made it accustomed to express greetings on the occasion of our holy season. At this Christmas time, when the Christian world dedicates itself to goodwill, it is our reciprocal privilege to greet you and through you, the members of the Christian community. End of quote. We greet you, Mr. Mayor, as a leader and representative of a new and honorable state. We greet you personally as a man who has dedicated himself to the high purpose of enlisting encouragement and material assistance for a liberty-loving people in their struggle for the God-given right to decent living conditions in a troubled world. A beautiful Thank you.
