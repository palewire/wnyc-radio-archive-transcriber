Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. New Yorkers have come to City Hall Park this evening to watch one of the town's Christmas time traditions, the lighting of the city Christmas trees. During this program, taking place on the steps of City Hall, you'll hear Mayor F.H. Lagardia's annual Christmas message to his fellow citizens. And after the mayor's address, his son Eric is scheduled to press the switch that will light the 22 Christmas trees in the parks in all the five boroughs, including the 40-foot tree in front of City Hall. And now we take you to the front of the City Hall steps where we hear a musical program by the New York City Police Department, Glee Club. The ball head, as I understood, is the bravesty.

Some have the most humble purpose of being turned into pulp that makes paper to carry the spoken and the written word. But what loftier purpose can be served by this beautiful tree that stands here than to stand forth in City Hall Park as the emblem of our real civilization, as that emblem of peace and goodwill that we need to show to the peoples of this city that we are a peaceful nation, that our citizens from all lands are here living peacefully together, and that we breathe to the people of all the world peace and goodwill. Thank you, Mr. Isaacs. I now take pleasure in presenting the mayor, who will give his Christmas message to the people. In keeping the beautiful custom established by the Department of Parks, the mayor joins in extending to the people of the City of New York his personal wishes for a merry Christmas. It is quite proper that approaching the day of Christmas, we pause from our labors for just a few moments and give thought to the significance of Christmas day we will be observing on the few days. Christmas has a real significance to people of all creeds. It signifies the mission of the Son of God on earth. A mission of brotherly love, of justice, of happiness, and of peace among all people. We are fortunate in this country that we have been better able during the last few years to give meaning to this lesson. We have been fortunate in being able to enjoy the blessing of peace. but we cannot be fully and completely happy if there are others in the world who are suffering because of war. We want to share the happiness of peace with all the people of the world. and let our Christmas prayers be dedicated to him in the highest for world peace. To the people of the city of New York, may you enjoy your Christmas holidays. May that enjoyment be in the midst of your own families. and let us announce to the entire world that we shall glorify him in the highest and pray for peace toward men of goodwill. A merry Christmas to you all. I think we can all add amen to that. The tree will now be lighted by Gene Lugardia who will throw the large switch. ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to the ceremony of the lighting of the Christmas trees being held on City Hall steps. They're just throwing the switch which is in the center of a huge Christmas wreath in front of the steps. The mayor just finished speaking and just then the lights in this 40-foot tree with a beautiful star on top of it overlooking the city hall park were just lighted. At the same time there are 22 trees in all covering the five boroughs of the city all lit up at once as that switch was pressed. In Borough Hall in Brooklyn Joyce Kilmer Park Bronx Kings and the Borough Hall in Richmond Park. The mayor just posed in front of the wreath and in front of the switch with his little daughter after the pressing of the switch. And now I believe we're to listen to the Sacred Heart Boys Choir. The Lord amid the snows upon the winter night will form the child the Christmas rose the king of love and light and why to sing the shabbat and the Christ of every child and that his blessed blood has got their exultation for Oh come let us adore him Oh come let us adore him Oh come let us adore him cross the Lord Oh give the heart with rapture gloves to greet the holy night that gave the world his Christmas rose his king of love and life every horse of his name the praise of the love from time right to I became that we with him adore Oh come let us adore him Oh come let us adore him Oh come let us adore him Christ Christ the Lord Come let us adore him Oh adore him Christ the Lord Oh Give us Christina Oh, come, let us adore Him. Let us adore Him, Christ the Lord. Let us adore Him. Let us adore Him. Let us adore Him. In the hills where they lay, Rocking things and sheep, On a cold winds of night, With so, so need. Lo-well, lo-well, lo-well, lo-well, Who is the King of Israel? Lo-well, lo-well, lo-well, lo-well, Who is the King of Israel? The League Club will now present O Holy Night. What? What? What? Huh? I don't know. What? What? Oh, holy night, the stars are brightly shining. It is the night of the dear Savior's birth. Long lay the world in sin and error pining, Till He appeared, And the soul felt His words. A thrill of hope, The weary world rejoices, For young the praise, A new and glorious Lord. Oh, Lord, your knees, Oh, hear the angels' voices, Oh, life. Batah-i-dice O'er, When Christ was born? Oh, life divine! All night divine, all night, all night divine.

And just at this moment, ladies and gentlemen, from the 40-foot tree across the park, there appeared a vision. It's Santa Claus. And the park department band, at the foot of the Christmas tree, playing Jingle Bells, we return you now to our studios in the municipal building. Thank you.
