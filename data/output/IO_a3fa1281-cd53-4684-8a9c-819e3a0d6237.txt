The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay on the rim In thekarines It breaks my heart to go. Something tells me I am near At the front to fight the foe. Give a soldier, boys, a marching And I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, Where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew And all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, fall in, it won't be long. We're on our way, hip hip hooray. We're going down south, hooray. We're going down south, way, way down the road. And since makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I've hunder Wondering, darling, if you're true. Listen to me, darling, if you're true. Listen to me, land and shun's land Though the ocean waves divide Absence makes the heart grow thunder Longly through the night And the sea is pure true. Listen to me, land and shun's land Though the ocean waves divide Absence makes the heart grow thunder Longing to be near your side Be near your side She was happy till she met you And the fault is all your own If she wishes to forget you You will please leave her alone She has come to her old mother Just because there is no other She'll be happy in her own sweet home When the harvest days are over Yes, she's here Christ, she's here And the sun gets flowers No, she's died so clear She's died so clear You will keep the word you said That's the time we do shall wear When the harvest days are over Jesse, dear My Jesse The day he would come with a strong head and love And the land stayed on He's life off the floor With a trail he adored And the land stayed on But his brain was so loaded It nearly exploded The poor girl would shake me along He carries the trail with the tall bearing ground And the past day long Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline My Adeline At night, dear heart At night, dear heart At night, dear heart For you I find For you I find For you I find In all my dreams In all my dreams Your fair face be I feel your heavenly theme. You're the flower of my heart. Sweet as a night, sweet as a heart. Sweet as a heart. Sweet as a heart. Sweet as a heart. Sweet as a heart. You're the flower of my heart. She's a bird in a gilded way A little branka, a shady green spot No happier home I find My heart's barely gone, I love only one She's the girl I have to be mine Just one girl, only just one girl Well, all of us I know that they're not my friend But always, she is just a play I'll be happy forever with just one girl I'll be happy forever with just one girl I'll be happy forever with just one girl I'll be happy forever with just one girl I'll be happy forever with just one I'll обяз mind Detectives orden Moving Hot Up Up Up Up Up Up The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Marie. Say au revoir, but not goodbye. The past is dead, love cannot die. We're better far had we not met. I love you then. I love you then. Lady, Lady, give me your answer too. I love crazy, oh for the love of you. You want me a smiling man, I can't afford a fairy. But you love me, oh for the sea, I think so good for you. When you hear the rest of the things in me. For joy, love and crazy you might sing. And when the birds stand true. In the forest of the night, is there real hot night? You'll come and sing. You'll come tonight. I see you when you hear the rest of the things in me. For joy, love and crazy you might sing. And when the birds stand true. And when the birds fall, I get there real hot night. You'll come tonight. We'll come tonight. And when the birds fall, I get there real hot night. And when the birds fall, I get there real hot night. I get there real hot night. Let's go tonight. Hey, Shh Dong.
