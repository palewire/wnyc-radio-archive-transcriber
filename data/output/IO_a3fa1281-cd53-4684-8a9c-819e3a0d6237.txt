The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay At home say they can no longer, not their God Oh, I can風 con갔, for I can name some I am near at the front to fight the foe. The boys are marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling, goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, follow this, it won't be long. We're on our way, hip hip hooray. We're going down south hooray. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I thunder. Wondering, darling, if you're true. Distance only lands and shone lands. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother. Just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, yes, she will, right, she will. And the sun gets flowers, no, she dies so clear. She dies so clear. You will see the word you say. You will see the word you say. That's the time we do shall wear. When the harvest days are over, yes, she will. Just be near, my just be near. You will see the word you say.
