The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the dull subtly break my heart to go. Something tells me I am near at the front to fight the foe. Heal us, soldier boys, on marching and I can no longer stay. Come, I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, fall in, it won't be long. We're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, full air. And since makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Never gonna use them just byatever we say. I know in and while they're speaking more. You're the same, picture and answer is surprising. bearders can wake up in the afternoon when I speak UK. Oh, thunder, that is why I long for you. Lonely through the night I thunder, wondering, darling, if you're true. Distance only lands and shuns there, though the ocean waves divine. Absence makes the heart grow thunder, longing to be near you. Be near your heart. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother, just because there is no other. She'll be happy till her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, yes, we do, Christ has been. And the sun gets flowers, no need, Christ, oh, please, need, Christ, oh, please. You will see the word you said, that's the time we do shall wear. When the harvest days are over, yes, be dear, may, may, may, may be years. k H ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha He bled off the floor with a chair he adored as the band played on. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded, the poor girl would shake me along. He's there is a girl with a ball-earing ground as the band played on. Sweet Adeline, my Adeline, at night, dear heart, for you I find. In all my dreams, your fair-faced be. You're the flower of my heart. Sweet Adeline, my heart, we love. He's only a man in a fearless pain, a beautiful sight to fear. You may think he's happy and free from care. He's not the most he seems to be. He's done when you think of a wasted life. For you cannot make me wait. And her beauty was sold for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a gilded way. A little brown car, a shady green spot. No happier home I find. My heart's barely gone, I love only one. She's the girl I left behind. She's the girl I left behind. Just one girl, only just one girl. I'll be happy forever, she's the girl. I'll be happy forever, she's the girl. I'll be happy forever, she's the girl. I'll be happy forever, she's the girl. I'll be happy forever, she's the girl. I'll be happy forever, she's the girl. I'll be happy forever, she's the girl. I'll be happy forever, she's the girl. I'll be happy forever, she's the girl. izan Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
