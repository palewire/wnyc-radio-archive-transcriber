It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great Admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The Mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic person. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Your services for mankind. The mayor of the photographers that we have here on this bright day at the city hall plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Pertuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. The mayor of Genoa. And for all our decapAC thank you. It is with profound commotion that I have listened to her words affectionate and cordial regarding my modest person and regarding the noble city that I have here the honor to represent. There are facts and acts that men do to make it. And every act that man has a particular meaning, so when she, the honor of Impiniteri, is here in Europe and is here in my city, she has not only made a visit of cordiality, she has also made an homage to the city of Cristoforo Colombo, and this is what I have heard from the people so connected to the land of America. But she, the honor of Impiniteri, is here in Genova, ambassador of democracy, of that democracy that is so dear to the people of the United States, but that is so dear to the people of the United States, so dear to the Italians, especially to the Genova. For this, the honor of Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, God who's hunting for all the African nations, those Allahs, cool running , the religion of American languages, independentist of their origin and social liking, people can achieve andimoniously on how much of their great resigns under the city has been redeemed. So this visit is not only a response, not only a courtesy of the Hon. Impeliter. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States, and his mayor, who has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. This visit is the statement of an uomo that belongs to the new democratic democratic society and has contributed to the rest of this woman and the population of the United States. This visit is the great people of the United States, the United States of the United States, which we are profoundly grateful. Because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to rid ourselves of democratic democratic freedom when it intervened so presently in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men also. So today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently because they have defended democracy in Europe and really in the world. And, well, onorevole Impeliteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work with this faith that we work with. Because the democratic democratic freedom are really being extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. Not easy. Not easy. Not easy. Forse talvolta noi italiani non siamo compresi. Bit of Chaparriking and be mitigating for nothing, a ripp时间 else. We thought of the sense inEurope, assented by a bit of puisque cigarettes and dioxidian for resistance or whatever. We have made them didnt establish anything, yes, but we are not experiencing it. Forza, l'attaccamento a questa fede democratica era così vivo che noi abbiamo ripreso il nostro lavoro. Abbiamo lavorato, lavoriamo, disperatamente lavoriamo per ricostruire moralmente e materialmente il nostro Paese. E' con questi sentimenti, onorevoli imperiteri, che io saluto lei e la città di New York e le dico che siamo tenaci nell'opera di ricostruzione della democrazia nel nostro Paese. Siamo tenaci e abbiamo degli esempi. Abbiamo degli esempi soprattutto a Genova. La tenacia di Colombo nel ricercare la vostra terra è un esempio a tutti i genovesi. Deriso, non creduto, contrastato da ogni avversità, dagli uomini e dagli avvenimenti, quest'uomo sapeva che questa grande terra esisteva e l'ha cercata disperatamente. E' andato assondando alle foci dei fiumi, è andato cercando negli estuari, ovunque, cercando quel passaggio che lui voleva trovare per congiungere tutto il mondo sotto la croce cristiana. Ebbene, non importa se lui poi non ha trovato il passaggio, non importa se ognuno di noi non trova il passaggio, bisogna persistere altri, troverà la strada. La strada perché tutto il mondo sia libero in pace e nel lavoro. Grazie. Mr. Pavia, will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to general, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which mean so much to us and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
