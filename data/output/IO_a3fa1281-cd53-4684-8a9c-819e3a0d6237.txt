The End Two little girls in blue, lad, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad, two, one, your father's home. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted above. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I see. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were boys. Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. The grass when man was was morning, they blew, or dare I be shy. When they just read us, my darling, no comrade was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken. And a mother's heart has broken. There is just another thing. From the old home that we've all. There is still a memory living. There's a father unforgiving. And a picture that is true. For the world. She's my sweetheart, I'm her beau. She's my Annie, I'm her beau. Goodwill rally, never to pass. Give her an easy, give her a free heart. One evening in the month of May.
