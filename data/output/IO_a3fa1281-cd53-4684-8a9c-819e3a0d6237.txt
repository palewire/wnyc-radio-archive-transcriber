The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the fuss of night He held at the front to fight the foe. He was soldier boy on marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling, goodbye, darling, pray. Come on now, sound, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, it won't be long, we're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, hooray. Hip, hip, hooray. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. Hush, hip, hooray. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Hush and snakes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I thunder. Wondering, darling, if you're true. Distance only lands and shone's there. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near you, son. Be near your son. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother just because there is no other. She'll be happy till she'll be happy till her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, yes, we do. Pisces inney But I'm 성ban's upperset". Just be there! My justy! The Highland Men The Manly Dog, and the band played on. He's like a blossom flow, with a trail he adored, as the band played on. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded. The poor girl would shake me along. He's there, he's a girl with a ball-earing ground, as the band played on. Sweet Adeline, my Adeline, at night, dear heart, for you I find. In all my dreams, your fair face feels. You're the flower of my heart. Sweet Adeline, my Adeline, my Adeline, my Adeline, my Adeline. He's only a man in a fearless day, a beautiful sight to hear. You may think he's happy and free from care. He's not the most he seems to be. He's done when you think of a wasted life, for you shall not make me wait. And her beauty was sold for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a year of my heart. A little brown car, a shady green spot, So happy and free from a happy home. My heart's barely gone, I love only one. She's the girl I love to be mine. She's the girl I love to be mine. She's the girl I love to be mine. Just one girl, only just one girl. Where are all the signs, oh, but they're not my friends. Come away, she is just one day. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. Wonder. I'll be happy forever, Christian. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. She was sweet. Wonder. She's sun off.

Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Comrades, when men was born, they blew their life behind. When they just read us, my darling, old comrades, what's there by my side?
