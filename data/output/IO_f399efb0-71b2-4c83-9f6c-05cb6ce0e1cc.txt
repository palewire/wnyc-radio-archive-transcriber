Now here is Mr. Coleman. Yes. Mayor Impoletari, it is my distinct honor and privilege today to present to you and through you, the people of the city of New York, the honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the mayor of Genoa, Italy. Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. the mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. Now, the world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of the government of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. when he was elected mayor of Genoa last year. He defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic person. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scarni of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And, Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor on Mayor Vittorio Plutuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the Mayor and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. The Mayor of Genoa, The Mayor of Genoa, The Mayor of Genoa, the Mayor of Genoa, The President of New York is with profound commotion that I have listened to his words affectionate and cordial regarding my modest person and regarding the noble city that I have here the honor to represent. There are facts and acts that are made by men and every act that man has a unique meaning, but there are facts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is here in Europe and is here in my city, she has not only completed a visit of cordiality, she has also made a homage to the mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the recognition of the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is here in Genova, ambassador of democracy, that is so expensive to men of the United States, but so expensive to the Italians, especially, for this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, for which every citizen of America, independent of their origin of their own social class, can come she has been given to the high level of representative of the city. So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri, this visit is the most important thing to visit of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States, and its own mayor, who has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. This visit is also the most important thing to say that the man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic American world has continued to drive a thank you for those who have given us to build who got tough. We know all the sacrifices that this people have made for us to give us democratic libertarians when we have intervened so potent in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men. So today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocination of democracy and have operated intelligently because it is to defend the democracy in Europe and in all the world. Well, onorevole Imperiteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it's with this faith that we work because democratic liberation is really being in the world and there is peace and work for all. It is not easy to do. For sometimes we don't understand it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is happening right when we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We have lost the city of Città Care territory in which our work could be exploited. But the commitment to this democratic faith was so vivid that we have taken our work. We have worked. We are working. We are working. We are working for our country to rebuild our country. It is with these sentiments, on the other hand, that I salute you and the city of New York. And I tell you that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of democracy in our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in searching for your land is an example to all the genoveses. The tenacious of the people who knew that this great land existed and looked at it. And he went to the river and looked at the river and looked at it. And looked at it in the river and looked at it. And looked at it in the river and looked at it. Still, he saw the future and all of us found the road... ....", safe place. Even if he found the road we needed to find the plurality of other nations of the church. Saying that for me has不能 compound ? that the world is free, in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end we shall succeed, we shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
