What was won yesterday was more than a political victory. Nor can I even claim that it was a victory for my party. It was a decision by a vast majority of our citizens, with no distinction of groups or elements or individuals, to continue on the course pursued for seven years under the leadership of our chief executive, who has so far steered the ship of state through the storms and reefs that beset the whole world at this time. With the election, passes whatever bitterness there has been in the campaign. Franklin Roosevelt will be the president of the whole country, and I am sure that those who supported Wendell Wolke will now join the president in his efforts to keep our nation out of war, and to carry on the program of economic progress that has brought us so far on the road to recovery. Let me, as national chairman of the Democratic Party, express my appreciation and gratitude to those who have helped us to bring about a result which the whole world will recognize as perhaps the greatest triumph for democracy of modern times. Let me convey to all the voters, for I realize that the victory is not of a party, and that it was due to the help of millions of conscientious men and women, of every party and of no party, the president's acknowledgment of the tremendous honor that has been conferred upon him. The country has voiced its faith in a great president, and the president is vindicated in his faith in the people of the United States. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've just presented an exclusive interview with the Honorable Edward Flynn, Democratic National Chairman, who has given his point of view, his expression of opinion here, regarding the Roosevelt victory. flying cameras happening along lasering foreign Southkey High
