Through the folds of thunder, Flag we conquer under, The flag that tries not to hide, For the loyethon of the thunder, From which is our country needs us, He is brave as he who leads us, Upon a child, how proud he heads us, Freedom, God, and Right. Froggy thieves and vases narrow, Flash with fear and flight of arrow, Fluid things of death or sorrow, Death is glory now. Earl the reeling, harsmen, o'er, Let the earth's end, o'er, When a friend, a wife, a lover, Cremble on the floor. Grand of life are riven, Glow for glory is given, With land in the spring of Belgium, And living to heaven. Grand of heart, young of glory, Would you win a name in glory, Cry for home, for life, for glory, Freedom, God, and Christ. For their third and concluding number, The Glee Club presents, Benny Havens, A ballad sung by Sons of West Point for over a hundred years, And sung today, wherever West Pointers gather. Come fill your glasses, fellows, And stand up in our row, To singing sentimentally, We're going for to go. In the army there so dry at sea, From motion very slow, So we'll sing our grand-decentes, Of Benny Havens' foe. O Benny Havens' foe. O Benny Havens' foe. O Benny Havens' foe. We'll sing our reminiscence, Of Benny Havens' foe. To our kind old alma mater, Our rock-bound island home, We'll cast back many upon regret, As for life's feet we roam. Until on our last battle's feet, The lights of heaven shall flow. We'll never fail To drink through birth, As Benny Havens foe. O Benny Havens' foe. We'll sing our grand-decentes, Of Benny Havens foe. May the army be augmented, So more than sea let's flow. May our country in the hour of need, Be ready for the fall. May the time of the soldiers let me, And be a chosen soul. May the time of the soldiers let me, And be a chosen soul. May the time of the soldiers let me, And be a chosen soul. May the time of the soldiers let me, And be a chosen soul. May the time of the soldiers let me, And be a chosen soul. May the time of the soldiers let me, And be a chosen soul. From West Point, we conclude this quarter hour of song, By the Cadet Glee Club, Conducted by Cadet G. S. Harper, With Warrant Officer Barry Drews in charge, And Cadet W. S. Fisher, pianist.

The final part of the commission is to introduce, To the principal's office, Will be broadcast over station WNYC. May we introduce Pete McGinnis. Now, what do you think of anything, Being 300 years old, Pete? Well, I want to let my good friends know, That it's been 300 years of royal welcome, That we have in the borough of Brooklyn. And in this borough, Gathered many tongues of many nations, All over the world. And we live all happy together, No matter what race we come to, No matter what our religion is, God has given us that feeling, That we shall continue to love one another, Irrespective of our religion, Our politics, As long as we are all good fellows together. I say in this great borough, In 300 years, It has developed, And it's been a thing, Of an inspiration, For the whole world. Those that have never had the chance, To see our great borough, Highly come here, To see our tall buildings, Our great manufacturers, Our many things of the interest, That help supply the good things, All over the world. Oh people, When the opportunity comes to you, Highly visit our borough. We are the borough, We are the borough, Of good hearted people, Good natured people, No drive was ever started, In the borough of Brooklyn, That ever fell down. This borough has been generous, In everything. War front drives, Red cross drives, War front drives, Cancer drives, And many, many others, Because the people of Brooklyn, Were always generous, And they give, They give them out, To this hunger famine, All over the world. And I hope the world, In return, Won't take advantage of ours, As has been done, On many occasions, But love and enjoy the friendship, Not alone of the borough of Brooklyn, But the good people, That come from all parts of the world, To make our country, What it is today. And Brooklyn is one of the springs, In our country, That has developed, And we in Brooklyn, Are very, very proud, That we are residents of this borough. I thank you. Now Pete, You've committed a grave error, You haven't said a word about Greenpoint. Well I wanted to be a little modest, I want to feel this way, That to me, Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world. It is a spot, Where I was raised, And first seen the light of day. At number 132 Eagle Street, Thanks be to God, There was a Greenpoint. Thanks be to God, That the light of day, Gave me my opportunity. And to the people of Greenpoint, I worked and worked, The same as every other man, And labored on the docks. I put lumber, I worked in the whole of business. I am proud, I tell you, I was a long shaman, I am delighted to say, That I work with men, And I've done the same thing, As every other man done, Work for an honest living, And thanks be to God for that. Thanks be to God. As we stand here, And look down historic, Fulton Street, We get some idea, Of the development of Brooklyn, As we look, As we said before, At the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore, Would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, Surely, I'd be glad to, On our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more, And we'll have an anniversary, For the oldest public building, Housing of Borough President. It may interest you to know that, This building was started in 1836, And then a depression set in, It lay here in Brooklyn, As a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected, In 1848. That's when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000, For the land, Which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there, On the right hand side, That old Arbuckle building, That's coming down, And we're going to build $11.5 million, Kings County, Supreme Court building. Then you go down a little further, And we're going to have, A brand new, Post office site. The old post office building, We're still going to keep there, And we're going to renovate that, And we're going to have a car, And other ones, Thanks a lot. We're here at Brooklyn, At Borough Hall, As we stand here, And look down historic Fulton Street, We get some idea, Of the development of Brooklyn, As we look as we said before, At the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you, Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, Surely, I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary.

We go down a little further, And we're going to have, A brand new, Post Office site. The old Post Office building, We're still going to keep there, And we're going to renovate that, And use it for a federal court. This whole Brooklyn Civic Center, Is going to be flanked on both sides, By public buildings, And right in the center of it, Is going to be a war memorial. And it's going to be a useful one, Instead of brick, lime, lumber, and cement. It's going to be in honor of the, 327,000 boys and girls, Who fought in this war. And don't forget, Brooklyn supplied more, And that 327,000, And of your 39 states in the union. In this war memorial, You're going to have, An auditorium that holds 1500 people. And then you're going to have a room on the right, Where the trophies that our boys captured, From the four corners of the world, Is going to be on display. And on the left hand side, Is going to be a room in bronze, Where the names will be inscribed, Of every boy and girl, Who made the supreme sacrifice. And downstairs, This is very interesting, And I believe you'll like it. We're going to have a room, For each of the veterans organizations, Which isn't anywhere in the city of New York. We're going to have the American Legion, The King's County, The Spanish war veterans, The Catholic war veterans, The Jewish war veterans. They're all going to be down there, In that one building. So as any of these 327,000 veterans, Need assistance, They'll have a central location, Point to which to go. Thank you. I appreciate you very much, Mr. President, Your busy life, Stepping by this way, And taking a few moments. That was quite a celebration, You had down with Hamilton Ferry, Wasn't it? You want to say a word about that? Yes, that was a big thrill. I'll tell you a little about that. A ferry boat, Known as the Moran Tugboat Company, Supply this company. Well he lives in Brooklyn, And he's a resident. I wonder if we can pick up somebody here, Will you? I shouldn't say, Pick up, that's the wrong term. He's a new car, Duke aboard, I was walking across this square with Pete McGinnis, I'm by a very athletic young man, Took hands with him, And he says, How are you? He says,
