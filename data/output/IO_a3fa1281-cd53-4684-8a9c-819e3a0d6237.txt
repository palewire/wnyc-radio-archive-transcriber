The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the fog, I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, babe Goodbye, darling, I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am near the end Something tells me I am near the front to fight the foe I am near the end of the front to fight the foe I hear the beautiful calling, goodbye, darling, pray. Come on, now sound, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song, jump on, it won't be long. We're on our way, it's pit for rain. We're going down south, through rain. And since makes the heart grow thunder, ooh. And since makes the heart grow thunder, that is why I long. And since makes the heart grow thunder, that is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I thunder, wondering, darling, if you're true. Lonely through the night, the sun shines through. Distance only lands and shams there. Though the ocean waves divide, Absence makes the heart grow thunder. The sun's a-lossed sun, longing to be near you. The sun's a-lossed sun. Be near your sun. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother, just because there is no other. She'll be happy till she'll be happy till she'll be happy. In her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, yes, she will, right, she will be. When the sun gets flowers, moon, it dies so clear. You will see the word you say, that's the time we do shall wear. When the harvest days are over, yes, she will, my, yes, she will. When the harvest day goes on, The portion of the garden The band played on. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded. The poor girl would shake me along. He derries the girl with a small-earing friend. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. The band played on. I left to be mine Just one cell Only just one cell Where are all the time But they're not my friend But always In just one place I'll be happy forever With just one cell I'll be happy forever With just one cell I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever Sweet Rosie O'Grady My dear little Rose She's my steady lady Most everyone knows And when we are married How happy we'll be For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady And Rosie O'Grady the sea In the close of our time In the close of our time Going through the shady lake With a lady's life With a lady's life To hold her hand And see her good And that's a very good sign And see your birthday home She's my close of our time As I walk along the Wapu Long with an independent air You can hear the girls declare He must be a millionaire You can hear them sign Wish to die You can see them Weep the other eye At the man that broke the bank At Monte Carlo And what's along the Wapu Long with an independent air You can hear the girls declare That goes a millionaire You can hear the sign And the sign And the reason with the other I'm a band And the bank At Monte Carlo Don't you hear them sound Don't you hear them sound They are ringing out The glory of the day Don't you hear them sound Thank you.
