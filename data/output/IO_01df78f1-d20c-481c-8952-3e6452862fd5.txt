Thank you. Thank you, boys. You were really wonderful. God bless you. I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, quiet back there, please. Thank you. Wonderful orchestra, really. They love music. They sleep music. They eat music. If they can only read music, that's it. I'm only kidding. If I said anything to insult you, I thank you. I would like, ladies and gentlemen, to introduce to you a young lady. When I say a young lady, I really mean it because she's a very, very beautiful young lady, and she's a grand star in her own right. She's a grand 20th Century Fox star. Incidentally, I'm under contract with them, and I just signed a 10-year contract with them, and next week they're going to let me read it. This young lady has been doing such a wonderful job in all the camps and Navy bases and everything, and her very swell and grand husband, who is in the Navy right now. In the Marines. I'm sorry. Pardon me. Well, all right. Thank you. Well, what's the difference? Huh? Thank you for correcting me. He's in the Marines, and oh, boy, and he's doing his part. He's doing a great job. May I present to you Annabella, Mrs. Tyrone Powell, ladies and gentlemen. I'm awfully sorry. I'm sorry about the Marines. Oh, darling. Ladies and gentlemen, I have to make a confession first, as you'll be able to realize very soon. I'm awfully bad to make speeches. So this morning, they gave me that to read to you. And on the way over in the car, I tried, and I found out that I was as bad to read it as to try to make it by myself. So if you don't mind, I'll try in my own words to tell you what I feel. And if my accent is not very good, and if I don't always use the right word, I want you to know that at least it comes from the bottom of my heart. I'm an American citizen now, and I'm very proud of it. I'm married to an American citizen. You know who he is, and I'm very proud of it, too. Thank you. But I was born in France, in Paris. and coming from Europe, as I suppose many of you did, and you have some of your family and some of your parents over there, you know all how much they are waiting for the American soldiers to arrive. So what we are going to try to do today and every day is to try to hurry that day of freedom for all those poor countries over there. And for that we need more guns and more tanks and more planes, and for that we need every penny we can give. Because a little while ago, 15 or 16 months ago, we were asked to buy defence bonds. And that was wonderful. We had to defend ourselves and we wanted to fight and we were hoping to win. But today, what you are asked for is even more exciting, because today we know we are going to win. But we want to win quickly. And if you can remember that maybe each time you are going to give a dollar, each time you are going to buy a bond, it's going to bring peace nearer to us. Maybe it's going to save an hour or one minute. So if you think of that when you are going to give the dollar, don't wait an hour. Don't wait a minute. Don't wait a second. But please, please do it now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Annabella. Thank you. Lots of good luck. Amara gots to tie. After all, what has Tyrone Powell got that I haven't got? I'm sorry to say. But, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure now to present to you, at this time, a gentleman who is the chairman of the War Emergency Board of the fur industry who discusses the records of the War Emergency Board. May I present to you the chairman, Mr. Lou White. Here he is, Mr. Lou White. Ladies and gentlemen, my friends have often told me that I look ten years younger with my hat on. And I'm sure that I'll feel at least 20 degrees warmer if I can keep my hat on. Pardon me, Mr. White. May I interrupt? Were you caught in the hair raid? If I had the humor that our friend Mr. Burrell has here, I could answer him. If you also had my hair, it would be all right. The War Emergency Board of the fur industry, composed of labor and management organizations in the industry, has done an outstanding job in its war effort activities. It has sponsored the previous war bond drive, the salvage drive, the blood donors drive, and through its war chest, recently distributed $250,000 to war relief agencies of the Allied nations. The Board's greatest gesture was the creation of the fur vest project, which is now of national scope and operation. Thousands of fur-lined vests have been distributed to brave merchant seamen of the Allied merchant marine, and this project is to be continued indefinitely to ensure a steady flow of these vests for the duration of the war. This project was made possible through the patriotism and generosity of the fur workers. Many of you, within the hearing of my voice, are giving unstintingly of your time and labor for this most worthy cause, and I'm sure you'll continue to do so. We are here today to ask you to make another contribution, but one which will not require your time or even effort. The United States government is asking you to put your money into the finest and safest investment in the world. Not only will you receive a good rate of interest and ensure yourself against poverty and distress in the years to come, but these bonds will pay big dividends in victory, freedom, and the peaceful pursuit of happiness. Bring those boys over there back quicker by backing them up with your dollars over here. And now it is my extreme pleasure to present to you a dynamic personality, a real friend of the fur industry, a man who has been untiring in his duty and devotion to his country and his city. His honor, the mayor of New York, Fiorella LaGuardia. Mr. Chairman, Benny, who said this was a ghost town? I wish some of these employers were trying to bring back starvation wages, and the sweatshops, and Macy's and Bloomingdale's and Abraham and Strauss could come here and see this ground. And incidentally, while we're fighting this war, we are not going to permit labor standards to be brought down. Now let Bloomingdale and Macy and Abraham and Strauss and Lord and Taylor take note of that and perhaps look at their own payrolls and give their employees a better birth. You know, Ben Gold asked me to come here to make an appeal for this second war loan, and after he asked me to come here and make the appeal, he just now told me you're oversubscribed already. And of course I know that the fur industry will come through as they always do. You know, as I said last night at Carnegie Hall, the matter's very simple. We either loan the money to our government and get it back with interest, or else Hitler and the Japs will come over here and take it away from us. We get nothing back. And we're not going to let them come over here. And that is why we want to make this second war loan not only successful, we want to oversubscribe it, and I am sure that the flourishing, prospering, great industrial town of New York will lead the whole procession. Now, of course, we have no illusions about this, men. It's going to be a long and difficult war. There's no doubt as to the outcome, but we must do a complete job. And that means that there is a great deal of hard and difficult fighting ahead. The news this week is rather encouraging. The French the British and our American troops are chasing Rummel and his army into the waters of the Bay of Tunis. The army of the Soviet Republicans are pushing back every attempt of the Nazi forces to break through again. The Russian army has now the Nazi army in the mud up to their knees and pretty soon they'll have them in the mud up to their necks. It wasn't so many weeks ago when Hitler was making preparations for his march into Moscow. And as I told you at the meeting Madison Square Garden the only time the Nazi army will see Moscow will be when they'll be taken there as prisoners of war. and yet as I say there's a great deal more fighting to be done. And we have to fight until we've beaten and crushed and destroyed the Japs Hitler and his little pal Mussolini too. None of them are any good and never were any good. And some of us knew that they were no good all of the time. So I want to congratulate the fur industry of New York City employers and the organized workers of the fur industry in getting an early start in this war loan in setting the example to other industries and I know that you'll make good for your country this time as you always make good. This war is not only for our protection it's for a better world to bring about the assurance of peace and economic security not only for our people but for the people of the entire world. thank you thank you honor for being LaGuardia was really a wonderful wonderful speech I know the little flower so well I call him bud I am never forget the time I landed California I came in on a plane and I landed at LaGuardia airport right on the brim of his hat but I do want to tell you incidentally I'm wearing an Adam's hat myself looks like Adam Warren but I do look he's rehearsing there again thank you what do you may I now you'll get a chance really to play that music they've been rehearsing there for about 15 minutes may I introduce now once again the little lady that sang our national anthem at the beginning of the show and she's going to do a little song for herself and for you lovely ladies and gentlemen may I present to you the star the singing star Rosalinda Miss Jean Merrill let's give her a swell reception Miss Jean off we go into the parable yonder climbing high into the sun here they come as we can meet our thunder and a noise before the sun down we dive to smoke our flame from under off with one terrible roar we live insane but go down insane place nothing else love the army core fighting men guarding the nation's border we'll be there followed by more in Eshelaw we carry on fighting nothing else about the army people lovely thank you very much so long Mayor LaGuardia Honorable Mayor LaGuardia thank you very much hope 343 comes in I want to tell you I I'm only kidding Mayor you know you know just goes to show you now Fiorello who just walked off the stage did you see him smile it goes to show you when you take a man like the Honorable Mayor LaGuardia when he can smile and we can say what we want to a man like the mayor when we say what we want to the president we must be living in a land of freedom and democracy and I really mean that sincerely ladies and gentlemen I would like I would like to introduce I would like to introduce a gentleman who's been doing his utmost and been doing a sensational job taught the war effort he he has a very marvelous position in the treasury department and he's going to say a few words and I present to you Mr. Mitchell of the treasury department ladies and gentlemen thank you Mr. Pearl I'm not going to talk to you about bonds I know as the mayor said that you people will assume your obligation what I want to talk to you about is what you are going to think during this bond drive and it's been said far better than I could tell you a long time ago by Thomas Paine he wrote it at the time of the revolution when we at that time also had a crisis this is what he said these are the times that try men's souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men and women tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph I call upon not a few but upon all not on this state or that state but upon every state and up and help us lay your shoulder to the wheel better to have too much force than too little when so much is at stake it matters not where you live or what rank of life you hold the evil or the blessing will reach you all the far and the near the home country and the back the rich and the poor will re-suffer and rejoice alike the heart that does not feel now is dead the blood of his children will curse his cowardice who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved the whole ask yourself just one question will you be proud of your boys when they come home of course you will now ask yourself another will they be proud of you you know the answer you're going to make them proud of you and I want to present one of the boys that we can be justly proud of a man who has seen action on practically all the fighting fronts a man who has done his work as we shall do ours from the coast guard mr.

Thank you. You're really wonderful. And now I think it's time that I'm going to retire, ladies and gentlemen, as you master ceremonies, and turn this program over to one whom you all know, and I think, and I believe, and I'm sure you respect. He's a business manager at the Furrier's Joint Council. He is one of the most elegant voices of Labour. He's been, in a large measure, responsible for the success of this rally, and his associates in the union have given their time and energy in the handling of arrangements. May I present to you, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Irving Potash, and thank you, and good afternoon. Thank you. Now, first of all, let's express en masse thanks to Mr. Milton Perle for his generosity and his kindness to come here and be with us and introduce everybody. Give the hand now, everybody. Thank you. Secondly, let me inform you that you stay on, and if you get into the shop a half hour or more later, you will be permitted to work it off, so stay till the meeting is over. And thirdly, let's see whether we can take our hands out of our pockets, all of us here. This is not just a meeting for the speakers from the platform. This is a meeting where all of you will have to speak. Those of you on the sides, all over, take your hands out of your pockets, and the rest of you to the right of me and those in the front. Let the gentlemen from the Treasury Department, let the United States government representatives know that you are here not only to listen to speeches, but you are here to demonstrate your readiness to support with money and with everything until we smash Hitlerism and wipe them off, the face of the earth. Get your hands out and put them up and this pledge to the United States government representatives here. Let's see your hands. Take them out of your pockets. Let's see this pledge from everybody here at this audience. Come up with your hands. Take them out. They won't freeze all over, down the other side. Express your opinion and your determination. Next, you have on this platform her workers, women, mothers, members of our union, workers in this industry who have given their sons in the United States armed forces, some of them two sons, some of them three, some of them their sons and daughters, some of them sitting on this platform, your sisters, working with you in your shops, members of your union, have had their sons over on the other side, who have already made their supreme sacrifice, who have already laid down their lives so that you and I and the rest of us in this world may live free of the boot of Hitler. They are right here, the mothers, your sisters, and your fellow members of your union and your industry. You have here a mother of a hero. You have read the newspapers only the other day of a member of our union, a young worker by the name of Abrams who was a lieutenant in one of the bombers' fortresses that sunk three German ships in the Atlantic. That hero's mother is right here on this platform. These mothers have given their sons and the United States Treasury Department is calling upon us to give money to buy bonds so that the United States government may be able to buy the best that the American people and the American workers can produce, the best ships, the best trains, the best tanks and guns to their sons and the sons of millions more to put an end to Hitlerism, to put an end to slavery, to bring about the world free of the threats, free of the slavery imposed by Hitler and the conquered people, to bring about a better and freer world for all of us. These are the mothers here who have sent their sons for that purpose. Last night, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Morgan Cowell, spoke at Carnegie Hall and is opening remarks. When he opened the speech, he said, the second friend is no military secret. We all know that just over the horizon, we of the United Nations are piling up the thunderclouds of the greatest attack in history. Now we are ready to deal a few blows ourselves. And there will be blows that I can promise that will rock Nazi Germany to its rotten, blood-stained foundation. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States government, the Cabinet member of our government, opened the speech last night with a statement that we are ready and this second war-bound drive is raised in order to make possible the invasion of Europe, in order to make possible the joining of hands of our brave American boys, of the heroic boys of the British Army, with the heroic people and army of the Soviet Union, in one mighty invasion of Europe that will once and for all put an end to Hitlerism and his slavery. And it is these bonds that we made you to buy today that will give the answer of the fur workers to the American government that we will give and give and give in every way possible to make possible the realization of the invasion of Europe, to make possible victory over Hitlerism in 1943. Now, it is my job and present job to introduce to you the next and last speaker, one who has inspired and led our union with its 80,000 members all over the United States and Canada to make a record of war activities that is a shining example for the entire labor movement in this country, one who is the inspirer of 7,000 members of our union who are today in the armed forces and who inspires these 7,000 members to fight in the front ranks of the American armed forces and who will give an account of themselves in the same manner and even more and even with greater sacrifice than the membership of our union that has stayed behind to support them on this side. It gives me pleasure to introduce to you the president of the International Foreign Leather Workers Union, Ben Goh. Friends, since that we are bound to enter a new very important and perhaps decisive phase of this great tragedy of mankind, it seems that a great many developments will take place in the year of 1943. It seems that a great many battles will take place in the very near future and every battle will bring closer the day when all of us and the entire civilized world will gather to celebrate the great moment of the collapse of the Nazi cannibals and the victory of the civilized world. Tables are definitely turning, slowly but surely. Not long ago, Hitler and his chiefs were bragging about the superiority of the German weapons. Today, it is generally recognized that our country alone succeeded in outproducing the Nazis to the decree that even the Nazis recognized this fact. Both in quality and quantity, our weapons are superior to the Nazis' murderous weapons, all against Turkish vet articles. In the morning, he was th Sekir together, I know he had an liberation is followed. and the Russian Sturmawiks are bombing Germany without a stop. And he feels the taste of his blitzkrieg methods. Not long ago, Churchill, in his speech stated to the British people, that the only thing that he can offer them is sweat and tears and blood. Today, Hitler and Gables and Gering sing that song and they talk to the German people of blood and tears and sweat. Not long ago, all of us were afraid that Hitler might carry out his threat to invade the British arms. Today, there is a great deal of talk about invasion, but the invasion of the United Nations and the European continent that will catch Hitler and the most brutal milkcracker in the history of military matters. On the one side, our boys and our British boys. On the other side, the glorious Red Army that will split the Nazi army and annihilate it. Until the Casablanca decision of unconditional surrender will become a fact. Until recently, Hitler kept on talking of speedy victory. Now, in our ranks, the talk in a speedy victory. We are done. Interested in that victory? Come as soon as possible. We can't afford to prevent this war too long. It is no more that great, invincible, Nazi cannibal army that threats the entire world. The Minas de la Beric and the Soviet Russian battlefields will never fight again on the side of the Nazis. In order to carry through that great fight of mankind, we must make every effort to help our government, help the armed forces of the United Nations to make that possible. And we gather today publicly and officially to reassure our decision and make it clear that we are ready and willing and eager to back up that decision by action. Now, we are opening the great campaign for 13 billion dollar bonds. And the fair workers who hate fascism, who hate reaction, who despise oppression, who are always on the job to fight for democracy and freedom and the rights of labor and the well-being of our nation, are called today to make the opening. The International Union intends to develop an intensive campaign to contribute two million dollars to this fund to buy bonds. I ask, is there a motion to instruct the General Executive Board to develop a campaign among these members for two million dollars in this month? Is there a motion to that effect? Is there any seconder to the motion? regularly moved and seconded to instruct and empower the General Executive Board of the International Union to develop the campaign for $2 million war bonds. All in favor signify by raising your hand and keep it up. Keep it up. Keep it up. Let's have a picture so that we can see it, whether there is a unanimous decision. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Beat Marksnell. Done. Any opposed, raise your hand. And this is the unanimous decision that we again serve no rest on the cannabis and on the appeasers and the agents of Hitler that we are ready to fight to the last drop of blood to annihilate the Nazis for the victory of the civilized world. At this time, may I ask you to take your heads off? Take your heads off. I introduce... And ladies and gentlemen, with this unanimous decision of the fur industry to back the second war loan of the United States government, we bring to a close this program of which has been taken part in the 29th Street, 7th Avenue corner, at which point the war emergency board of the fur industry has held its war bond rally. Among the speakers that were heard on today's program was his honor, the mayor of the city of New York, Mayor LaGuardia. Milton Burrell served as MC for part of the program. Henry Angle, chairman of the war bond rally committee of the fur industry. George I. Fox, chairman of the war bond committee. Lou White, chairman of the war emergency board of the fur industry. And Jean Merrill, that is, a metropolitan opera star, who sang the Star-Spangled Banner and the Army Air Corps song. And also, we just heard from the president of the Furious Union, Ben Gold. Ladies and gentlemen, we, before we leave, remind you that once again, when you buy bonds, you are only lending your money while your own brothers, sons and husbands are giving their lives. And so, on the theme of any bonds today, we conclude this program, which has been a public service feature of your city station. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System. instituted by Natasha.fee 17h youth by Cav Designers. ersatzium chiens. bowled vEdou minds. emergencies with disaster. Suspisead to refer ihr, whisper.
