When you walk by a war bond, remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the boys overseas are giving their lives. You are only asked to lend your money. And on this theme, your city station microphones are set up at 29th Street and 7th Avenue on the southwest corner to bring you the ceremonies of the war bond rally of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry. Among the notable speakers to be heard will include our own mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Fiorello H. Ligardia. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Henry H. Engel, who is chairman of this rally. Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a privilege to present a great singing star who has graciously consented to be with us at this monster war bond rally. She has sung with the Metropolitan Opera Company, the San Francisco Opera Company, and is now one of the stars of that smash hit operetta, Rosalinda. It gives me great pleasure to present Miss Jean Merrill, who will sing our national anthem. Thank you.

Keep the home fires burning while the hearts are yearning. Though the land be far away they dream our home. There's a silver lining through the dark clouds shining. Turn the dark clouds inside out till the boys come home. There's a long, long trail a-winding until my dreams all come true. Till the day when I'll be going down that long, long trail with you. We're on our way, glory laying down. It's a long way to Tipperary. It's a long way to go. It's a long way to Tipperary. The sweetest girl in all the world to me. So goodbye to Pinkanilly and farewell, Esther, swear. It's a long, long way to Tipperary. But my heart's right there. Nights are long, sinuendo away. I think about you all through the day. My body, ooh, my body, ooh. Nobody quite so true. Miss your voice, the touch of your hand. I long to know that you understand my body, ooh. My body, ooh, my body, ooh. Your body, miss your voice, the touch of your hand. Ooh. Over there, over there. Send a word, send a word over there. That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming. The Yanks are coming everywhere. So prepare, say a prayer. Send a word, send a word to beware. We'll be over, we'll be over. And we won't come back till it's over, over there. Over, over there. Yes, sir. Wonderful, wonderful. Come on, let's give him a big hand. Come on, let's give him a big hand. The Coast Guard Quartet. Come on, look at that. Come on, look at that. God bless you, boys. Well, it just goes to show you, ladies and gentlemen, that what a land of democracy and freedom that we're living in. Well, we can have four boys to come up here and sing from the well right from the bottom of their heart and really mean everything and really mean it all. Thank you, boys. You're really wonderful. God bless you. I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, quiet back there, please. Thank you. Wonderful orchestra, really. They love music. They sleep music. They eat music. That's it. I'm only kidding. If I said anything to insult you, I thank you. I would like, ladies and gentlemen, to introduce to you a young lady. When I say a young lady, I really mean it because she's a very, very beautiful young lady and she's a grand star in her own right. She's a grand 20th Century Fox star. Incidentally, I'm under contract with them and I just signed a 10-year contract with them. And next week, they're going to let me read it. This young lady has been doing such a wonderful job in all the camps and Navy bases and everything. And her very swell and grand husband, who is in the Navy right now. In the Marines. I'm sorry. Pardon me. Well, all right. Thank you. I'm sorry. Well, what's the difference? Huh? Thank you for correcting me. He's in the Marines. And oh, boy. And he's doing his part. He's doing a great job. May I present to you, Annabella, Mrs. Tyrone Powell, ladies and gentlemen. I'm awfully sorry about that. Thank you. I'm sorry about that. Oh, darling. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I have to make a confession first. As you'll be able to realize very soon, I'm awfully bad to make speeches. So this morning, they gave me that, to read to you. And on the way over in the car, I tried and I found out that I was as bad to read it that just to try to make it by myself. So if you don't mind, I'll try in my own words to tell you what I feel. And if my accent is not very good and if I don't always use the right word, I want you to know that at least it comes from the bottom of my heart. I'm an American citizen now. I'm an American citizen now. And I'm very proud of it. I'm married to an American citizen. You know who he is. And I'm very proud of it, too. But I was born in France, in Paris. And coming from Europe, as I suppose many of you did, and you have some of your family and some of your parents over there, you know all how much they are waiting for the American soldiers to arrive. So what we are going to try to do today and every day is to try to hurry that day of freedom for all those poor countries over there. And for that, we need more guns and more tanks and more planes. And for that, we need every penny we can give. Because a little while ago, 15 or 16 months ago, we were asked to buy defense bonds. And that was wonderful. We had to defend ourselves. And we wanted to fight. And we were hoping to win. But today, what you are asked for is even more exciting. Because today, we know we are going to win. But we want to win quickly. And if you can remember that maybe each time you are going to give a dollar, each time you are going to buy a bond, it's going to bring peace nearer to us. Maybe it's going to save an hour or one minute. So, if you think of that when you are going to give the dollar, don't wait an hour. Don't wait a minute. Don't wait a second. But please, please, do it now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Annabella. Thank you. Lots of good luck. Tomorrow he got to tie. After all, what has Tyrone Powell got that I haven't got? I'm sorry to say. But, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure now to present to you, at this time, a gentleman who is the chairman of the War Emergency Board of the fur industry, who discusses the records of the War Emergency Board. May I present to you, the chairman, Mr. Lou White. Here he is. Mr. Lou White. Ladies and gentlemen, my friends have often told me that I look ten years younger with my hat on. And I'm sure that I'll feel at least 20 degrees warmer if I can keep my hat on. Oh, pardon me, Mr. White. May I interrupt? Were you caught in the hair rain? If I had the Uber that our friend Mr. Burl has here, I could answer him. But if you also had my hair, it would be all right. The War Emergency Board of the fur industry, composed of labor and management organizations in the industry, has done an outstanding job in its war effort activities. It has sponsored the previous war bond drive, the salvage drive, the blood donors drive, and through its war chest, recently distributed $250,000 to war relief agencies of the Allied nations. The Board's greatest gesture was the creation of the fur vest project, which is now of national scope and operation. Thousands of fur line vests have been distributed to brave merchant seamen of the Allied merchant marine. And this project is to be continued indefinitely to ensure a steady flow of these vests for the duration of the war. This project was made possible through the patriotism and generosity of the fur workers. Many of you within the hearing of my voice are giving unstintingly of your time and labor for this most worthy cause, and I'm sure you will continue to do so. We are here today to ask you to make another contribution, but one which will not require your time or even effort. The United States government is asking you to put your money into the finest and safest investment in the world. Not only will you receive a good rate of interest and ensure yourself against poverty and distress in the years to come, but these bonds will pay big dividends in victory, freedom, and the peaceful pursuit of happiness. Bring those boys over there back quicker by backing them up with your dollars over here. And now it is my extreme pleasure to present to you a dynamic personality, a real friend of the fur industry, a man who has been untiring in his duty and devotion to his country and his city. His honor, the mayor of New York, Fiorella LaGuardia. His honor, the mayor of New York, Fiorella LaGuardia. Mr. Chairman, Benny, who said this was a ghost town? I wish some of these employers were trying to bring back starvation wages and the sweatshops and Macy's and Bloomingdale's and Abraham and Strauss could come here and see this ground. And incidentally, while we're fighting this war, we are not going to permit labor standards to be brought down. Now let Bloomingdale's and Macy's and Abraham and Strauss and Lord and Taylor take note of that and perhaps look at their own payrolls and give their employees a better birth. You know, Ben Gold asked me to come here to make an appeal for this second war loan. And after he asked me to come here to make an appeal, he just now told me you're oversubscribed already. And of course I know that the fur industry will come through as they always do. You know, as I said last night at Carnegie Hall, the matter is very simple. We either loan the money to our government and get it back with interest or else Hitler and the Japs will come over here and take it away from us. We get nothing back. And we're not going to let them come over here. And that is why we want to make this second war loan not only successful, we want to oversubscribe it. And I am sure that the flourishing, prospering, great industrial town of New York will lead the whole procession. Now, of course, we have no illusions about this, men. It's going to be a long and difficult war. There's no doubt as to the outcome. But we must do a complete job. And that means that there is a great deal of hard and difficult fighting ahead. The news this week is rather encouraging. The French, the British and our American troops are chasing Rommel and his army into the waters of the Bay of Tunis. The army of the Soviet republicans are pushing back every attempt of the Nazi forces to break through again. The Russian army has now the Nazi army in the mud up to their knees. And pretty soon they'll have them in the mud up to their necks. It wasn't so many weeks ago when Hitler was making preparations for his march into Moscow. And as I told you at the meeting, Madison Square Garden, the only time the Nazi army will see Moscow will be when they'll be taken there as prisoners of war. And yet, as I say, there's a great deal more fighting to be done. And we have to fight until we've beaten and crushed and destroyed the Japs, Hitler, and his little pal Mussolini too. None of them are any good and never were any good. And some of us knew that they were no good all of the time. So I want to congratulate the fur industry of New York City, employers, and the organized workers of the fur industry in getting an early start in this war loan, in setting the example to other industries. And I know that you'll make good for your country this time, as you always make good. This war is not only for our protection. It's for a better world to bring about the assurance of peace and economic security, not only for our people, but for the people of the entire world. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Honorable Mayor, LaGuardia. It was really a wonderful, wonderful speech. I know the little flower so well, I call him Bud. I know. Never forget the time I landed in California, I came in on a plane, and I landed at LaGuardia Airport, right on the brim of his hat. But I do want to tell you, incidentally, I'm wearing an Adam's hat myself. Looks like Adam wore it. But I do, look, he's rehearsing there again. Thank you. Thank you. What do you want? May I, now you'll get a chance really to play that music. They've been rehearsing there for about 15 minutes. May I introduce now, once again, the little lady that sang our national anthem at the beginning of the show. And she's going to do a little song for herself. And for you, lovely ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you the star, the singing star, Rosalinda, Miss Jean Merrill. Let's give her a swell reception. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To the far blue yonder, climbing high into the sun. Here they come, zooming to meet our thunder, and a noise before the sun. Down we dive, spunk our flame from under, off with one terrible roar. We live in vain, but go down in vain, nothing will stop the Army Corps. Fighting men, guarding the nation's border, we'll be there followed by more. In Eshelon, we carry on fighting nothing without the Army Corps. Lovely. Thank you very much. So long, Mayor LaGuardia. Honorable Mayor LaGuardia. Thank you very much. Home 343 comes in. I want to tell you, I, uh... I'm only kidding, Mayor. You know, you know, I... Just goes to show you, now, uh, Fiorello, who just walked off the stage, did you see him smile? It goes to show you, when you take a man like the Honorable Mayor LaGuardia, when he can smile and we can say what we want to a man like, uh, the mayor, when we say what we want to the president, we must be living in a land of freedom and democracy. And I really mean that sincerely, ladies and gentlemen. I would like... I would like to introduce... I would like to introduce a gentleman who's been doing his utmost and been doing a sensational job. I talk of a war, uh, effort. He, uh... He has a very marvelous position in the Treasury Department, and he's going to say a few words. May I present to you, Mr. Mitchell, of the Treasury Department, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Mr. Pearl. I'm not going to talk to you about bonds. I know, as the mayor said, that you people will assume your obligation. What I want to talk to you about is what you are going to think during this bond drive. And it's been said far better than I could tell you a long time ago by Thomas Paine. He wrote it at the time of the Revolution, when we at that time also had a crisis. This is what he said. These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country. But he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men and women. Tyranny like hell is not easily conquered. Yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. I call upon not a few, but upon all. Not on this state or that state, but upon every state. And up and help us. Lay your shoulder to the wheel. Better to have too much force than too little when so much is at stake. It matters not where you live or what rank of life you hold. The evil or the blessing will reach you all. The far and the near, the home country and the back. The rich and the poor will re-suffer and rejoice alike. The heart that does not feel now is dead. The blood of his children will curse his cowardice, who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved the whole. Ask yourself just one question. Will you be proud of your boys when they come home? Of course you will. Now ask yourself another. Will they be proud of you? You know the ANSI are going to make them proud of you. And I want to present one of the boys that we can be justly proud of. A man who has seen action on practically all the fighting fronts. A man who has done his work as we shall do ours. From the Coast Guard, Mr. Joe Press. The boys out there are doing a good job. I've seen them, and I've seen them die by the guns. So all I can say is, they're out there giving the Japanese, the Italian, and the Germans hell. And all I can say is, you just can give the bonds hell and get the guns over there. Thank you. Thank you, Joe. A grand-looking boy. And thank you, Mr. Frank Mitchell of the Treasury Department. And now, ladies and gentlemen, being that Joe Chris is one of the United States Coast Guards, I think it's just proper, once again, through numerous requests, to have the Coast Guard Quartet sing another song for us. How about it? One more song from the Coast Guard Quartet. Are you all ready, boys? Well, that was a solid, huh? Got you. This is my America. That's what we're going to sing, Mr. Burr. This is our America. Let's go. You ready? For this is my America. Land of liberty. For this is my America. Where all men are free. So let us raise each voice in praise. To our God of love. He gave us all America. The land we'll always love. We thank thee for America. The land that we're always at war. And love. From valors and plains America grew. This beloved America Washington knew. Our America, stretching from coast to coast. Has given a heritage we proudly boast. We stand ready to defend our land. And we want the enemy to understand. And they cannot stop us, no matter how hard they try. We will fight for our America. And if need be, we'll die. With taps, we now wish to offer a tribute. Our honored heroes, we reverently salute. For for this country, let us stay here. ¶¶ Thank you, Coast Guard Quartet. Thank you. You're really wonderful. And now I think it's time that I'm going to retire, ladies and gentlemen, as you master of ceremonies, and turn this program over to one whom you all know, and I think, and I believe, and I'm sure you respect. He's a business manager at the Furrier's Joint Council. He is one of the most elegant voices of labor. He's been in a large measure responsible for the success of this rally, and his associates in the union have given their time and energy in the handling of arrangements. May I present to you, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Irving Potash, and thank you, and good afternoon. Now, first of all, let's express en masse thanks to Mr. Milton Perle for his generosity and his kindness to come here and be with us and introduce everybody. Give the hand now, everybody. Secondly, let me inform you that you stay on, and if you get into the shop a half hour or more later, you will be permitted to work it off, so stay until the meeting is over. And thirdly, let's see whether we can take our hands out of our pockets, all of us here. This is not just a meeting for the speakers from the platform. This is a meeting where all of you will have to speak. Those of you on the sides, all over, take your hands out of your pockets, and the rest of you to the right of me and those in the front. Let the gentlemen from the Treasury Department, let the United States government representatives know that you are here not only to listen to speeches, but you are here to demonstrate your readiness to support with money and with everything until we smash Hitlerism and wipe them off the face of the earth. Get your hands out and put them up. And this pledge to the United States government representatives here. Let's see your hands. Take them out of your pockets. Let's see this pledge from everybody here at this audience. Come up with your hands. Take them out. They won't freeze. All over, down the other side. Express your opinion and your determination. Next, you have on this platform for workers, women, mothers, members of our union, workers in this industry who have given their sons in the United States armed forces, some of them two sons, some of them three, some of them their sons and daughters, some of them sitting on this platform, your sisters working with you in your shops, members of your union, have had their sons over on the other side, who have already made their supreme sacrifice, who have already laid down their lives so that you and I and the rest of us in this world may live free of the boot of Hitler. They are right here, the mothers, your sisters, and your fellow members of your union and your industry. You have here a mother of a hero. You have read it in the newspapers only the other day of a member of our union, a young worker by the name of Abrams, who was a lieutenant in one of the bombers' fortresses that sunk three German ships in the Atlantic. That hero's mother is right here on this platform. These mothers have given their sons, and the United States Treasury Department is calling upon us to give money to buy bonds so that the United States government may be able to buy the best that the American people and the American workers can produce the best ships, the best trains, the best tanks and guns to their sons and the sons of millions more to put an end to Hitlerism, to put an end to slavery, to bring about the world free of the threats, free of the slavery imposed by Hitler and the conquered people, to bring about a better and freer world for all of us. These are the mothers here who have sent their sons for that purpose. Last night, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Morgan Cowell, spoke at Carnegie Hall and is opening remarks. When he opened the speech, he said, the second friend is no military secret. We all know that just over the horizon, we of the United Nations are piling up the thunderclouds of the greatest attack in history. Now we are ready to deal a few blows ourselves. And there will be blows that I can promise that will rock Nazi Germany to its rotten, blood-stained foundation. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States government, the Cabinet member of our government, opened the speech last night with a statement that we are ready and this second war bond drive is raised in order to make possible the invasion of Europe, in order to make possible the joining of hands of our brave American boys, of the heroic boys of the British Army, with the heroic people and army of the Soviet Union in one mighty invasion of Europe that will once and for all put an end to Hitlerism and his slavery. And it is these bonds that we made you to buy today that will give the answer of the fur workers to the American government, that we will give and give and give in every way possible to make possible the realization of the invasion of Europe, to make possible victory over Hitlerism in 1943. And now, it is my job and present job to introduce to you the next and last speaker, one who has inspired and led our union with its 80,000 members all over the United States and Canada to make a record of war activities that is a shining example for the entire labor movement in this country. One who is the inspirer of 7,000 members of our union who are today in the armed forces and who inspires these 7,000 members to fight in the front ranks of the American armed forces and who will give an account of themselves in the same manner and even more eroically and even with greater sacrifice than the membership of our union that has stayed behind to support them on this side. It gives me pleasure to introduce to you the president of the International Foreign Latter Workers Union, Ben Goh. France, it seems that we are bound to enter a new, very important and perhaps decisive phase of this great tragedy of mankind. It seems that a great many developments will take place in the year of 1943. It seems that a great many battles will take place in the very near future. and every battle will bring closer the day when all of us and the entire civilized world will gather to celebrate the great moment of the collapse of the Nazi cannibals and the victory of the civilized world. Tables are definitely turning slowly but surely. Not long ago, Hitler and his chiefs were bragging about the superiority of the German weapons. Today, it is generally recognized that our country alone succeeded in outproducing the Nazis to the decree that even the Nazis recognized this fact. Both in quality and quantity, our weapons are superior to the Nazis' murderous weapons, not long ago, the entire world was trembling with fear at the threat of Hitler that he is going to continue bombing London to a shambles. Today, this situation is entirely different. Our liberators and fortresses and the Spitfires and the Russian Sturmuriks are bombing Germany without a stop and he feels the taste of his blitzkrieg methods. Not long ago, Churchill in his speech stated to the British people that the only thing that he can offer them is sweat and tears and blood. Today, Hitler and Gables and Garens sing that song and they talk to the German people of love and tears and sweat. Not long ago, all of us were afraid that Hitler might carry out his threat to invade the British arms. Today, there is a great deal of thought about invasion, but the invasion of the United Nations and the European continent that will catch Hitler and the most brutal nutcracker in the history of military matters. On the one side, our boys and the British boys. On the other side, the glorious Red Army that will split the Nazi Army and annihilate it until the Casablanca decision of unconditional surrender will become a fact. Until recently, Hitler Cup come talking of speedy victory. Now, in our ranks, the force is a speedy victory. We are done. Interested in that victory? Come as soon as possible. We can't afford to prevent this war too long. It is no war that great, invincible, Nazi, cannibal army that threatened the entire world. the menace, the liberi, and the Soviet Russian battlefields will never fight again on the side of the Nazis. In order to carry through the great fight of mankind, we must make every effort to help our government, help the armed forces of the United Nations to make that possible. And we gather today, publicly and officially, to reassure our decision and make it clear that we are ready and willing and eager to back up that decision by action. that now we are opening the great campaign for $13 billion bonds and the fellow workers who hate fascism, who hate reaction, who despise oppression, who are always on the job to fight for democracy and freedom and the rights of labor and the well-being of our nation are called today to make the opening. The International Union intends to develop an intensive campaign to contribute $2 million to this fund to buy bonds. I ask, is there a motion to instruct the General Executive Board to develop the campaign among its members for $2 million in this month? Is there a motion to that effect?
