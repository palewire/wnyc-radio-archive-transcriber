I am down here at the dispatch office of the Whitehall Street Terminal working out the final schedules and I can say officially that normal six boat ferry service will be resumed at 3.30 p.m. today, August the 13th. I would like to take this opportunity to express particular appreciation to the people of Staten Island for their forbearance, understanding and cooperation during the rush hours this morning when unauthorized absenteeism reduced the ferry schedule to two boats during the rush hours. Through teamwork and direct supervision, we were able to get all commuters New York bound by 9.45 a.m., which in view of the situation that confronted us was a fine tribute to Captain William M. McGuire, the director of our ferry service and his experienced operational staff. I had been down at St. George with Deputy Commissioner Alexander Pete Chopin since 5 o'clock this morning. We got things and ordered down there to the extent we were able and then conferred with the union leadership at my office at 11 a.m. I personally and directly and urgently requested that the union leadership direct all men to return to work immediately.
