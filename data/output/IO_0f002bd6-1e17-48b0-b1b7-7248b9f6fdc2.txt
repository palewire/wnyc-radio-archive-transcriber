We hear first, The Banks of Allen Water, followed by Now is the Month of Maying. On the banks of Allen Water, where the springtime may fall, On the middle of the lovely daughter, there has come them all. For it's dry, a soldier's summer, and a willing country. On the banks of Allen Water, now is the May and King. The Banks of Allen Water, where the northern spread is low, There has come them hill and snow, and a willing country. For it's dry, a soldier's summer, and a willing country. For it's dry, a soldier's summer, and a willing country. On the banks of Allen Water, now is the May and King. The Banks of Allen Water, when the winter snow fell past, Till the scenes of the miller's door, And a willing country. The killing blues of land. From the millers of the old land, Both the cold and careless stream. On the banks of Allen Water, And a willing country. Let it out!

And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Borey, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Music Oh, I love plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I got no car, got no mule, I got no misery. The coast is plenty of plenty, down a lot on the door. Great somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in-more. What for, what for? I got a lot on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that'll pay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got my gal, got my song, the head is a-whole-day-long. Do you complainin'? Got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my song. I got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I got the sun, got the moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of plenty, got the great old days. Keeps the plenty, you know how to worry I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, and the time of life. Never want me long as I'm well. Never want to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell, are you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, for heaven's all day long. What are you complaining? Got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've Got Plenty of Nothing from Gershwin's Forgy and Bet. The choristers are under the direction of Florence Martirosian, with Isabelle LeBori as piano accompanist.
