Good evening. From the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria, your city station brings you the after-dinner ceremonies of the gold medal award dinner of the Williamsburg Settlement of Brooklyn. Governor Thomas E. Dewey is the guest of honor tonight and is to receive the award for being the person who in the past year has done outstanding work for the underprivileged and who typifies the American way of life. Others participating in the program are Mayor Vincent Aram Pelletieri, John Foster Dulles, Vladimir Popovic, the Yugoslav ambassador to the United States, humorist Harry Hirshfield and Jackie Robinson of the Brooklyn Dodgers. The master of ceremonies is Happy Felton who is speaking to us now. Here now is Mr. Felton. I'm informed that we are about to go on the radio and as an old tired announcer of longstanding, I only think it's fair to tell all the people that are listening in out there that you are listening to the annual gold medal award dinner in honor of the honorable Thomas E. Dewey, governor of the state of New York, which is sponsored by the Williamsburg Settlement Incorporated and the Brooklyn Philanthropic League Incorporated, the United Order of True Sisters. Toastmaster is Happy Felton and now we've taken care of all the billing, haven't we? May I introduce to you, by the way, I met a most charming gentleman seated to my left on the day. And he asked me to read his telegram. I have it here and I want you to meet Ambassador Popovic, the our ambassador from Yugoslavia. And if he'll stand, I'll be glad to read his message. If you'd like to read his message. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. He says, congratulations, Governor Dewey. I am very happy to be here on this auspicious occasion for such a worthy cause. And it's signed, Vladimir Popovich. Thank you. My pleasure to introduce next to you the Honorable Robert F. Wagner, Jr., President of the Borough of Manhattan and a sponsor of the Williamsburg Settlement, Mr. Wagner. Thank you. Mr. Felton, Governor Dewey, Mayor Impeletary, distinguished offices of the Williamsburg Settlement, and ladies and gentlemen. It's been often said that those who stoop to help stand erect before their fellow men. And that is so true of everyone who has done so much to make the Williamsburg Settlement such a great thing for the kids of the city of New York. And I'm also very happy to have the privilege of extending my congratulations on the award to Governor Thomas E. Dewey, not only because he is a most distinguished governor in the traditions of the governors of the state of New York, but because he has been a great, great international voice for all of us here in America in the fight for freedom and democracy for which we all pray. Thank you very, very much. May I introduce another sponsor of the Williamsburg Settlement, a most important one. Assistant U.S. Attorney, former Justice of the Domestic Relations Court, the Honorable Florence Perlow Schintag. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Dear Governor, the Gold Medal Award and so many of our friends here this evening say that you put public service above partisanship. That, I believe, is true in the larger sense. I know, too, that even in your lesser appointments to public office, you have been nonpolitical and nonpartisan because I, a Democrat, am an example of that. For when we were both young, Governor, and when you were a special prosecutor, you appointed me to your staff. From then on, Governor Dewey's appointments have been getting better and better. A few years ago, he appointed my husband to higher judicial office than he had there to. He had there to be a better, but the governor, and the governor, as Ms. Todd has said, and as Frank Hogan, who was also on his staff, has indicated, has ever been an inspiration to those who have worked with him. And we know that history will show, even more than we can say, how great your contribution to the American scene, to the state, and to the nation, to the world at large, have been. Thank you very much. It is my privilege now to introduce a gentleman speaking for myself. I had the privilege of working with him on the Sandlot program in baseball, which is naturally very close to my heart last year. He did a magnificent one-man job. He's a sponsor of the Williamsburg Settlement. And I guess more important than that to all of us, he's our mayor, the Honorable Vincent R. Impelletari. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Happy Felton, Your Excellency Governor Dewey, ladies and gentlemen. The chair lady came over to Ambassador Austin and myself and limited us, limited both of us to 50 words in a telegram. And I'm going to abide by that admonition. My telegram reads as follows. Addressed to Mrs. Gertrude Ammerman, care of thousands of grateful children, Hotel Waldorf Astoria. The annual gold medal award dinner of the Williamsburg Settlement has definitely earned its place as a New York City tradition. You have made an excellent choice in selecting for your accolade the first citizen of the state of New York, who has always given intense devotion to the charitable causes which you represent. To Governor Dewey, my personal congratulations and the congratulations and the appreciation of all the people of my city. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And now may I introduce to you the father of all the Brooklyn settlements, who's been active in every good cause, and a sponsor of the Williamsburg Settlement, Justice of the Supreme Court State of New York, and the founder of Youth United, the Honorable George J. Beldock. Mr. Governor, distinguished guests and ladies and gentlemen, when they came to me, they ran out of telegrams. And so I had to write my message on this piece of paper, but you'll understand that that's the reason why perhaps I'll run beyond the 50 words, Mr. Mayor. The emphasis tonight is on youth and on your youthful Governor Dewey for his great contribution to the service of youth welfare in the state. Now, Governor, I've said many things about you through the years, and they were all very good. And I know that the people assembled on this dais can say the same. You have great many achievements to your credit, from the days when you started as a fearless federal prosecutor, those exciting days in the district attorney's office, the great days as governor of our state, the office that you've served in the past 10 years so nobly, your work as a statesman, as a great leader, as an orator, as a candidate for high national office, and recently as an orator. But I, tonight, put foremost on the list of your accomplishments the work that you did in leading the state, the vision that you had in showing us the way in the creation of the New York State Youth Board. And time doesn't permit to tell you all why I put that at the head of the list. And second on the list, Governor, I place your leadership in creating the New York State Commission Against Discrimination, the New York Youth Board that is saving our children, that is making healthy citizens for our communities, the Commission Against Discrimination that is combating bias, particularly in the field of education, those two achievements alone are sufficient for me to say you've earned this gold medal award tonight. We look forward to your leadership. We look forward to your health. We all wish for you the best of everything in this world. God bless you. And now, ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce a most attractive young lady, 17 years old, who made her debut in Rome at the age of 15 in the Barber of Seville. She's going to sing for you now. She was born in Buffalo, New York, and she is very soon going to do a concert at Carnegie Hall. Colettura Soprano, Miss Jeanette LaBianca. Shall we give her a nice welcome? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And you, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're doing it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And you, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And you, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. fallen, to assuage the wounds of the defeated, and to build a sound peace based on freedom and the dignity of every human being. And that in our state and in a growing number of states in this country, no one could be denied his opportunity to earn a living by reason of who his father was. No one could be denied an education. But we really had arrived at a genuine feeling that we knew that every man was just as good as every other man, regardless of his parentage, his religion, or whether he was black, yellow, brown, white, or red. When we have arrived at that situation, wholly throughout this country, we have been able we shall have achieved all of the purposes our founding fathers desired to achieve. When we have accepted the brotherhood of man under the fatherhood of God, wholly with our hearts as well as our minds, we shall have done so much that I don't even think we will need a Williamsburg settlement anymore. And when you have worked your way out of a job in this wonderful service, as I believe will happen, we will then have all the reason to believe that all the struggles and all the efforts have not been in vain. And all of you who have made it possible shall have lived richly and better than you knew. Thank you very much indeed. You have been listening to the after-dinner ceremonies of the gold medal award dinner of the Williamsburg Settlement of Brooklyn. Governor Thomas E. Dewey received the Settlement's gold medal award for his work for the underprivileged and for typifying the American way of life. Guests at the dinner included Mayor Vincent R. Impeletere, John Foster Dulles, Miss Jeanette LaBianca, Robert Wagner, humorist Harry Hirshfield, Warren R. Austin, Jackie Robinson, Dorothy Sarnoff, and Mimi Benzel, and a good many others.
