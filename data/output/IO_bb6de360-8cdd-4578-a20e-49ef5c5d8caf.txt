Good evening everyone, youngsters and oldsters alike, and welcome to the Comics Parade, a special public service of your city station during the newspaper delivery tie-up, bringing your report on today's activities of your favorite comic strip characters. On invitation of His Honor the Mayor, WNYC is proud to present as comic narrators this evening, the well-known stars of Columbia's It Pays to be Ignorant, and here's Tom Howard and George Shelton. Thank you, George, that was very, very nicely put. Say, Tom, tell me something, what is little Orphan Annie doing? Well, George, I have it right here. You're interested in Orphan Annie, right? Yeah, I want to see. So am I, I think it's great. I don't want nothing to happen to her. No, well, don't worry, nothing will happen. Of course, she's in a pretty bad spot right now, we know that. But this one opens today, George, with the detective, the copper. Oh, the fellow that brought her and put her back. That brought her back. In that nice family that you know. Yeah, he went out to the farm and got her, remember, and brought her back. Well, he meets the district attorney on the street, that's old Sprig Sprout, I think they call him Sprout. Oh, I don't like him. Oh, he's a mean guy. Yeah. He's out for no good. You bet he is. Huh? You bet he is. Oh, no, he's out for no good. Well, the cop meets him and he says, you know, Sprig Sprout, that kid is innocent. Annie. The copper says, yeah. Meaning Annie. Meaning Annie. Yeah. He says, that kid is innocent. Why don't you give her a chance? I think she is innocent, too. Oh, what do you know you think she is? We know she is. But you can't make the district attorney believe that. What does he say? He says, you stick to being a cop. Yeah. Because I'll handle my job. Oh, tough guy. Yeah, yeah. I'd like to bust him right in the snooze. Me too. Huh? I'd like to hit him with a tomato or something. Oh, tomato isn't hard enough, George. No, no. So he says, you stick to your job, I'll handle my job. Yeah. He says, I'll convict that kid of first degree murder. No. He means Annie. Yeah. Oh, no. What do you think of that guy? Oh, that's mean. The best people in this town, he says, wants it. Oh. The best people in the town. He's supposed to be. Oh, it makes me sick. Yeah. He says, it's going to be a very popular verdict. Uh-huh. So the cop says, yeah, popular. Go ahead. See, he saw it. Yeah, naturally. Popular, he says, go ahead. And he says, I hope you never sleep another wink as long as you live. He said that it is Rickatone. He said that. Oh, great, great. Oh, boy, that told it to him, didn't it? Certainly did. So the district attorney walks away laughing. He says, ha, ha, ha. He says, why shouldn't I sleep? My conscience is clear. Oh, he's lying. He hasn't got any conscience, the guy. That's right. He says, my conscience is under very good control, copper. That kid is a nobody. What can she ever do to me? Oh, he'll find out. That's the end of that. That's the end. Oh, he'll find out. Well, will he find out? He'll get it good. Oh, see, and Dick Tracy. Have you got Dick Tracy? Dick Tracy? Yeah. Yeah, here's Dick, Dick Tracy. Oh, I hope he's all right. Well, you remember how Dick Tracy, the last time we heard about Dick, remember he went out to the van who's in the house? That's right. To find out about this money bag and all. Oh, yeah, that. And you remember, it was up in the tree and the breathless was the maid and she went down into the gardener's cottage and killed the gardener with the pruning shears. Yeah. Remember that? Yes, I know. Right in his back when his back was turned. Right. She's no good either. Oh, that breathless, you mean. Well, you know what she does to get away? You remember she run out and got in the laundry wagon. Yeah, yeah. The man was bringing the laundry to deliver it. That's right. So she runs out and gets in the laundry wagon with the money. Oh, that's, yeah, she had all that money. Yeah, she had all that money. And the money gets upset and the laundry wagon is all over the floor. Yeah. So the man that drives the laundry wagon, that's Wally, I think they call him, he gets in the drive away and as he's driving along, he happens to look through the little window in the back of the truck. Yeah, huh. Remember? And he sees this dame in here with all this money scattered all over the floor. Yeah. You remember that? Yes, I remember that. So he wants half. Oh, half of all her money? He wants half of the money and she won't give it to him. Oh, I bet breathless is breathless now. Oh, breathless, he's worse than breathless. Well, as this thing opens, you see, George, Tracy finds out about the laundry and the address from Mrs. Van Hoosie. So he goes down to the laundry. And here we find... Where this fellow works, huh? Yeah. Yeah. So here we find him talking to the manager of the laundry. What's he say? See, there's the manager standing back at the counter. He's a nice looking man. Yeah, he's an intelligent looking fella. Yeah. Where's glasses? Yeah. Something out of his eyes or something. See all the bundles on the shelves of laundry. Oh, yeah. Those bundles of laundry. Yeah. They're lucky, the people that get that laundry today, huh? So he says, Tracy says, I'm looking for the driver who picks up the Van Hoosie laundry up at Willow Lane and 8th Street. That's where the Van Hoosie's live. Yeah, that's the estate up there. Beautiful place she has. Nice, isn't it? I wonder what she paid for that, Joey. Oh, my God. Those willow trees. Oh, beautiful. She just had them pruned. I know she did. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the manager of the laundry says, oh, he says, yes, that's Whitewash Wally's district. See, Whitewash Wally, they call him. Oh, the driver of the laundry truck. Oh, the truck. That's his nickname, Whitewash Wally. Yeah. He says, that's Whitewash Wally's district, Mr. Tracy. He won't report in for a couple of hours yet. Uh-huh. Because he has to make a lot of other deliveries and pick up other laundry. See, he won't be back. So then the scene changes here, and it shows a laundry truck parked beside the road. Uh-huh. See? With a laundry driver sitting on the road beside the... Whitewash Wally's sitting with him. Yeah. He's sitting outside, and he's got Breathless, the prisoner, in the truck. Oh, good. He won't let Breathless out of the truck unless she splits 50-50 of the money. Oh, I see. See? I see. He's got the door locked. Yeah. So Breathless is in there saying, well, I can sit here just as long as you can. $1,000 is my top offer. Uh-huh. So she offers him $1,000 to call a deal off and let her out and go about her business. Uh-huh. But he wants half. He wants... How much was it all together? Well, wasn't it about $50,000? $50,000. That guy was $25,000. $25,000. $50,000. Yeah. He says right here, he says, I want half, baby, and half I'm going to get. Uh-huh. Yeah. You think he'll get it? I don't know. Oh, look what happens here. What? This Breathless is a pretty smart name. She says, you'll be sorry you ever met me, brother. You won't have a whole piece of laundry left in this truck. Look what she's doing, George. What? She's tearing up all the laundry in the truck. Oh, I hope mine isn't there. I don't know. Well, if it is, it's gone. You'll have to buy new laundry. Yeah, I guess I will. There she is tearing it all. You know what that means? What? A driver goes back. Look at the much laundry she's ruining here. Oh, boy. So he says, what are you doing? What did you say? He looks in the truck in there. She's tearing up all the laundry. Yeah, and what'd he do then? Well, that's all there is. Oh. We've got to wait till the next... Wait till tomorrow, huh? Yes. We've got to wait till the next newspaper comes out, whenever that'll be. I see. Anything else you like, George? Yes. Have you got any... Oh, Smiling Jack is good. Smiling Jack? I always like him. Yeah, let's see what he's smiling about. He's always laughing. He's not laughing lately. No? He's been pretty tough spot. No. Well, we find him here on the island talking to that woman. What was her name? Do you remember? You know, the woman that escaped with him in the boat? Oh, yeah, I forget her. His little son. I forget her name. So she's talking to Jack and she tells him, just before I went on my last mission and was shot down in enemy country, headquarters had offered me to send my baby to America. See? That's what Jack's telling her. Yeah, I see. Jack's telling her that. That girl that. Yeah. So, he heard us talking about shipping him, and that is why he stowed away on my bomber. You remember that time? Oh, yes, yes. Little Jack's son overheard them talking about shipping the son away from his father. Yeah. That little kid was pretty smart. He overheard him. So, you remember he stowed away on the bomber? So she's telling the story. Yeah. From Sun Heights, you got a cold, isn't it? Yeah, I got a little tickle in my throat. A tickle? Yeah, I'm excited about Jack. I see. Well, he stowed away in a bomber, as you know. So she's telling it to the girl. So, he says, I had thought about sending him back to live with Cherry, my sister-in-law. I see. See? Who also has a young child. That would be nice, Jack, but Cherry would probably be busy looking after her own baby. The woman says that. Oh, I see. She says that to Jack. This woman's got something in her mind. Yeah. I think she's trying to get the baby herself. Oh, yes. See what she says here on the next picture? Please, let me take him, Jack. I'll give him every care. Oh. She says to Jack. Now, in comes this... She's scheming, huh? Yeah. In comes this sergeant, or... You remember the sergeant was kind of sweet on Jack? Yeah. The woman, whack, I think she is. Yeah. Yeah. She likes Jack. Yeah. And she says in her mind, see, it's all in clouded for you. Oh, she's thinking. That means she's thinking, see. It doesn't say she's talking, it's thinking, but it gives you an idea what she's thinking about. She says to herself, I don't like that woman. I can't stand much more of this. If Jack lets her take him, I'll blow my top. She says. Ah, she's in here. She's going to butt in there any minute now. She's going to blow her top. She might... You know, women, she might... You can tell more about women. Oh, yeah. She's apt to blow this other woman's top. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, that'll be too tough. Well, we've got to leave that here, George. That's the finish of that, huh? That's the finish of that until tomorrow. See, have you got... Is Popeye around? Popeye? Yeah. No, I can't. Oh, yeah. That's the Journal of American Pictorial. Yeah. Yeah, here it is. Popeye. Oh, yeah. Look, this shows little... The Timble. Timble. The Timble Theater or something. Oh, yeah. The Timble Theater, it's called, but this is Popeye. This is... Look, the first picture shows little Sweet Pea. Oh, yeah. What's he doing? He's reading a book here. See the book? What's the name of it? Jack and the Beanstalk. Oh, that's... Oh, he's reading the story of Jack and the Beanstalk. I read that. That's great. And he says, well, blow me down. He's very much interested. Sweet Pea says? Yeah. He's interested in the story. You know about the Beanstalk. Yeah. So, uh, Aunt Jones is in the room, too. Yeah. See, there's Andy Jones sitting here in the next picture shelling beans. She's nice-looking. Yeah, nice-looking girl. Yeah, she's kindly, old soul, isn't she? Yeah. Yeah. I don't care much for that hairdo there. No. No, it's all right. That's a style. That's a style. That's a style. Yeah, yeah. The shoes looks a little too big for her, too. Yeah, yeah. Anyhow, she's shelling beans there. Yeah. And after, uh, Sweet Pea reads the book, he gets an idea. So he creeps over to Andy Jones. He says, Andy Jones, I don't suppose you'd mind if I takes one of your beans. Just one will do. Yeah, what did Andy Jones say? She says, you can have as many as you want, Sweet Pea. Uh-huh. But he only takes one. Uh-huh. See? What's he wanting for? Well, here it shows in the next picture. Oh. See him running away with the bean in his hand? Oh, yeah, yeah. He says to himself, this might not work, but there's nothing like trying. What's he going to try? Even if it don't, it's a good idea. Well, I can figure out. He, he's reading the story of Jack the Beanstalk, so he's got the bean in his hand. Oh, I see. He figures he's going to plant it. Oh. Yeah, here he is. See in the next picture? Right. See him with the pick? Yeah, huh? I wonder where he got the pick. I don't know. Well, look, he's digging a hole. And along comes Popeye. Oh, yeah. I like him. And, uh... Look, he's still smoking his pipe. Yeah. He's still, he's always smoking that pipe. Yeah. So he says, so Popeye, he says to Popeye, little Sweet Pea says, did you ever hear the swell story about Sweet Pea in the beanstalk? Sweet Pea? No, no. He's changing the name. I never heard that. No, but he's changing it. Oh, I see. He's bringing it up to date. That means him in the beanstalk. Oh. The other one was Jack in the beanstalk. That's right. This is going to be Sweet Pea in the beanstalk. I see. And Popeye says, no, I don't believe I have. Uh-huh. That's Popeye. Yeah. He talks coarser than that. Doesn't he? Yeah. No, I don't believe I have. Oh, that's very good. That's very good. Yeah. Don't believe I have. Sounds a little like Popeye. Yeah, it does. You even look a little bit like him. Oh, but I haven't got the pipe. No. And, uh, Sweet Pea says, this is a magic bean. He says, I am planting it. When it grows, I will climb the stalk and find four big giants at the top. Well, what do you know about that? Popeye says, you don't say. Oh, that's very good. Huh? Getting better at the dialogue. Yeah, yeah. He says, you don't say. Hmm. So, uh, Sweet Pea says, yeah. He says, one is named Thee. He's talking about the four giants that's going to be at the top of the beanstalk. Yeah. He says, one is named Thee, one is named Fly, one is named Fo. Uh-huh. And then there's one named Fumble. Fumble, huh? Fumble. That giant, he says, he's an awful tough giant. Fumble is, huh? Fumble. Hmm. He says, well, wait till I get them giants, he says, when I get up to the top of this beanstalk, when it grows. He says, I gives Thee an uppercut. Yeah, huh? I catch his thigh on the button. Uh-oh. And then I smack's foe in the stomach. Oh, that's good. Yeah, but, uh, Popeye says, uh, how about Fumble? Uh-huh. See, how about Fumble? Yeah, that's the one. And Sweet Pea says, are you worried? Are you worried about Popeye knowing me the way he does? And after just seeing me take care of three big giants, don't you think I can handle Fumble? I bet he can, too. I bet he does. Yeah. And just then, Popeye hops to look around. He says, look, look, there's a rabbit digging up your bean. Oh, boy. In the meantime, a rabbit come along and start to dig up little Sweet Pea's bean. Yeah. Yeah. Where, says, uh, Sweet Pea. Let me at him. I'll get him. See, there's a Sweet Pea running for the rabbit. Look at him going after him, huh? Here he runs and he finds the rabbit. There's the rabbit. They meet face to face. Uh-huh. Look at the face on the rabbit. His teeth is growing. He's made of Sweet Pea. Yeah. And just then, the rabbit chases Sweet Pea. Yeah. And there we find Sweet Pea running like thunder with the rabbit after him. Look at him. Popeye hollers after him. He says, oh, what do you think of that? I thought you was a giant killer, Sweet Pea. Yeah. And Sweet Pea says, I am, but he ain't a giant, meaning the rabbit. Right. Oh, boy, that's great, isn't it? Isn't it, Vinny? That's marvelous. He lost the bean and everything. Sure. Well, uh, George, I think that's about all we got time for now. It is? So we'll just have to say good night, kiddies. We'll be seeing you sometime again in the future. Yes, good night, kiddies. We'll see you again. Thank you, Tom Howard and George Shelton. Thanks for coming down this evening to keep our listeners informed of the latest doings of their favorite comic strip characters.
