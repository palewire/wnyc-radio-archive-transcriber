And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Bore, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their gifts and gifts, got a lot on the doors. Pray somebody's a-goin' to rob them, but without a-make-in-more. What for, what for? I've got a lot on the door, that's the way to be. They can see the drugs on the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are on me. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's ready for me. I've got my gals, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gals, got my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's ready for me. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's ready for me. The folks with plenty of money God will pray all the day He's the plenty, you know how to worry I keep the devil away Away, away I am the bread of hell In a time to ride Never want to be long as I'm well Never want to try to be long, to be bad What the hell are you glad, I'm the Lord Oh, I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's like me for me I've got my gals Got my gals For heaven, oh, they love Now you complain it Got my gals Got my gals Got my lord Got my lord Got my lord You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing I've got plenty of nothing from Gershwin's Forgy and Betts.
