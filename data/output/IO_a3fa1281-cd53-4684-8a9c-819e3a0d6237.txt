Goodbye, darling, I must leave you. Though it breaks my heart to go, Something tells me I am near. I am near at the front to fight the foe. Give the soldier boys a marching, And I can no longer stay. I hear the people calling. Goodbye, darling, babe. Come on, now, south, way, way, down south, Where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, And all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, but it won't be long. We're on our way. It's here for rain. We're going downtown. To live!

I'd just like to have one, just the same as that. Where ever I go, they shout, hello! Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir, but not goodbye. The past is dead. Love cannot die. We're better far had we not met. I love you then. I love you then. Baby, baby, give me your answer too. I love crazy, oh for the love of you. You want me a smiling man. I can't afford a family. But you love me, oh for the sea. I think so good for you. When you hear the rest of things in me. For joy, love, and praise the human thing. And when the birds stand true. In the forest of the day, there may a hot night. You'll come to my singing. When you hear the rest of things in me. For joy, love, and praise the human thing. And when the birds stand true. In the forest of the day, there may a hot night. You'll come to my sing. You'll come to my sing. Come to my sing. Crying. Crying. Crying. Crying. Crying.
