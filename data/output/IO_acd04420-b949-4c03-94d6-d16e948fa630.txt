This afternoon, most of you participated in the very simple and significant ceremony by which this magnificent place was transferred to the University to serve as a home for this and future meetings of the American Assembly. This represents, from the standpoint of the University, the fulfillment of an aspiration for such a conference center which we have long held. We believe that the plans which have been made and which are now approaching fruition have been soundly made. We believe, and indeed I need not add that we hope, that this will prove to be an institution of national service which will thoroughly justify the effort that has been made to make it available. And which will justify, in addition, the generosity of the Harriman brothers whose assist without his assistance this could not have been done. And so, ladies and gentlemen, I have the very great pleasure, on behalf of the University Administration, now in turning this meeting and the future sessions of this meeting of the Assembly, over to Ambassador Douglas, the Chairman of the National Policy Board, in whose hands we are from now on. Ambassador Douglas. Now, ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Kirk, members of the American Assembly and its guests, in calling this Assembly, this first session of the American Assembly to order, as it were, I am not unconscious of the handicap under which it is being held. It is the handicap of the absence of the President of Columbia University, General Eisenhower. He regrets deeply that his duties elsewhere prevent him from participating in this session, and the peace of the American Assembly. But he has expressed his own feelings much more adequately and much more pungently and much more convincingly than I could do it for him. He has written me a letter, which he has asked me to read to you. My inability to attend the opening conference of the American Assembly is more than a personal disappointment. I feel robbed of an opportunity to participate in an event which I am firmly convinced will grow to be a program of incalculable value to our country. This value will, of course, depend on the objectivity and impartiality of the proceedings, the integrity and thoroughness of the professional research work, and upon the character and qualifications of the participants. This initial conference is and must be regarded as an experiment from which much will be learned to improve and guide us in the conduct of future meetings of the American Assembly. But the quality of those who attend this conference, their abilities and high loyalty to the nation's welfare assure its unqualified success. I hope you will give Senator Taft, the moment has been detained, and Senator Douglas, my sincere thanks for taking the time from their public duties to speak on this occasion. I hope, too, that you will extend to every participant the assurance of my personal appreciation for this cooperation. As well as a warm welcome from the Columbia University family to the home of the American Assembly, with cordial, personal regard, Ike Eisenhower. Illinois jetzt nochtardson- It is a very real infirmity that he cannot be here, for this is his creature. This is the child of his mind, and his personality is necessary to the growth of this infant during its early days. I am but a very poor substitute. But I am sure that you all will join with me in expressing the hope that at the next meeting of the Assembly, General Eisenhower will be here to nourish and foster the creature of his own imagination. There's little that I can say about the Assembly, the American Assembly, that has not already been said. But there are two observations that I should like to make. The first is that if it is to discharge adequately and effectively the responsibilities which we all repose upon it, then it must preserve with meticulous care its complete intellectual independence. Its critical faculties must be guarded. Its intellectual integrity must be defended against any inclusion. I remember once, many years ago, sitting with... ...Cremon Sal, in his little fisherman's cottage in the Vend√©e. ...I asked him what he considered to be the most valuable qualities of a person to possess. And after considering the question for a few minutes, he placed his hand upon my knee and he said, ...My son, I have lived almost the span of a century. And so he has. ...I have seen kingdoms made. ...I have seen kingdoms destroyed. ...He chuckled. ...And he said, I have probably destroyed more government than any other living person. ...And as I review this scene, he said, I have come to the conclusion that there are only two things in life that really matter. ...The first is to love and to be loved, and the second is to be intellectually honest. Now that quality of intellectual integrity is a quality which the American Assembly must preserve. ...It's usefulness will depend largely upon its ability to protect that one essential characteristic. The second observation I should like to make about the first session of the American Assembly is that because it is the first meeting, it must by its nature be experimental. Experimental in the way in which the data has been assembled and distributed to the participants. Experimental in the organization of this particular meeting. Experimental in the way in which the findings, if any, ...shall be distributed throughout the public consciousness of the country. This is an extraordinarily difficult task that has been undertaken. And it will not be easy to find the answers that from day to day and month to month ...will put in their questions, which will put in their appearance. And so you must, I hope you will, view this as the first earnest and sincere endeavor to perform a national service. If you have criticisms, as I hope you will have. If you have suggestions, and I am confident that you will entertain them. ...we express the expectation that you will express them. ...so that future sessions of the Assembly can be improved by this experience. ...I have said that this first session was operating under a handicap. ...and so it is. ...but on the other side of the coin, ...there is an advantage ...for both senators, Senator Douglas and Senator Tapp, ...have agreed this evening ...to present alternative views ...of the issues which they ...believe to be associated with and implicit in ...the subject which was chosen for this meeting of the Assembly. ...that is, the United States relationship with Western Europe. ...viewed from within the context of the present worldwide international environment. ...And I should like to add your appreciation to the appreciation of General Eisenhower to both Senator Douglas and Senator Tapp, ...and to Senator Tapp, ...for taking the time from their public duties ...to start this session off. ...with what may be two somewhat divergent statements of opinion. ...and of facts. ...Ultimately, we hope ...that this Assembly will be able to define some area of agreement ...and that it will also be able to define an area of disagreement. ...Disagreements are not, in themselves, injurious to a free society. ...Indeed, as long as men are free, disagreements will always exist. ...The important thing about disagreements in a free society is they reflect an honest disagreement. ...And so, it would be of great significance to the country if this Assembly, could it do no more, ...were to define honestly and with complete integrity an area of disagreement as to fact and as to conclusion. ...And this evening, Senator Douglas has agreed to speak. ...Senator Tapp, similarly, and here he is. ...I'm sorry, Bob, we've proceeded, knowing that you would come, ...because of the time element on the... ...limitations of time on the radio. ...Senator Taft has agreed very generously to speak this evening, and Senator Douglas, similarly, has agreed to speak. ...After they have finished and concluded their presentation, ...they have agreed to submit themselves to questions. ...I shall be the arbiter of the nature of the question, of the time. ...But I'd like to make this quite clear, ...that any question which is put to either of the two distinguished senators, ...will be put similarly to the other. ...And the questions will alternate. ...Senator Douglas will speak first, and Senator Taft will speak second. ...The first question will be put to Senator Taft, ...and the similar question, an identical question, will be put to Senator Douglas. ...Is he? ...Is he? ...I'll give you a second. ...I will give you a second. ...Well, before we go further, I again should like to express our gratitude collectively and individually, ...to both Senator Douglas and Senator Taft, for agreeing to come here and to start this first session of the Assembly, ...off, as it were, on a high plane. Neither one of these two gentlemen need any introduction, ...and I would be wasting your time, their time, and everybody else's time, ...if I were to attempt to introduce them. I merely want to make it clear that the one is entitled to as much respect as the other. ...This is a frightfully difficult thing to do. ...I could say something very nice about both of them, and be quite honest. ...And that I shall. ...Senator Douglas has been a distinguished member of the Senate since he first went there in 1945. ...With his views, many of us have from time to time disagreed, ...but no one of us has ever questioned his intellectual integrity. ...And with the full assurances of our free unions, ...you're coming here tonight, our respect for you as an individual, ...and as a member of the second, amongst the senior branch of the Legislative, ...of the United States government. ...I introduce you. ...I introduce you. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...rets ... And I think it is true that they and the British Dominions today, and I include in this all the British Dominions, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, have been coasting along on the strength of the so-called great powers. If they are to make a proportionate contribution, they should greatly increase the number of men under arms, Belgium and Holland and Denmark, and Australia, New Zealand and Canada. It is always somewhat ungracious, however, for the big nations to urge the small nations to arm in this fashion, but there is an obligation upon them. The point I want to make is this, that as of January, they had as many men under arms in relationship to their population as we have. Indeed, if you were to take the French reserve forces, men who had served their period of compulsory military service and had passed into the reserve, and there were a million and a half of those and formed in reserve divisions, though poorly equipped, the French ratio was 50 to the thousand as compared to our 18. I was basing my figures on 2 and 3 quarter million men under arms as of the end of January. Of course, we hope that by summer, and it's planned by summer, to have roughly 3 and a half million men under arms. That would be 23 to the thousand. But there is every evidence that when the French add 15 more divisions on the continent of Europe, which is their plan, the French ratio will exceed 23 to the thousand, and that the planned increase in the size of the British forces, which runs from 100,000 to 200,000, the total men, will bring them very close to 23 to the thousand, perhaps 21 to the thousand. So that I think we can say that the major powers are going up together in the ratio of men in the armed services, and that we are not being asked to bear. We are not being asked to bear a disproportionate share of the manpower burden. What about the financial support? What about the money contributions, which, though less important than men, are still extremely important? Well, I've made some comparisons there, too, taking the expenditures for national armament and figuring them as a percentage of gross national product. I would prefer to take net national income as a better absolute measure, but as a relative measure. I think it's all right to use gross national product for the various countries. Last year, the year 1950, all of these countries were probably spending, with exception of Italy, or rather we should say UK and France, were probably spending a somewhat larger fraction of their national income for purely armament purposes than were we. At present, we are spending at the rate of 25 billion a year, which is about one-twelfth of our gross national product, or a little over 8% of the total. The ratio for France and the French budget, 9.7%, and for the United Kingdom, 8.0%. The French budget may be slightly padded for military expenditure, but I think one can safely say that the French, as of this moment, are spending about the same proportion of their national income that we are spending, and the British are probably spending as large a fraction of their national income. We, of course, intend to double this rate of expenditure, from 25 billions a year to a rate of 50 billions a year, and that 50 billions will include the sums which we will spend for the rearmament of Western Europe, re-equipping French divisions. This will be one-sixth of the gross national product, assuming that to be a constant magnitude. The British budget is going to increase, but according to my figures, it will not increase much beyond 11% of the gross national product. The French may get up to 11%. This is the first point, this is the first figure which I've turned up, indicating a greater degree of sacrifice on our part than the major European nations. But let us see, let us go into that a bit more and see whether it really is a greater degree of sacrifice. The per capita real income of the United States, in terms of American dollars, is about $1,500 per year. The per capita income, in terms of American dollars in Great Britain, is about $750 a year. And in France, something over $450 a year. Or in other words, our per capita income, in terms of real purchasing power, is about twice. The per capita purchasing power of Great Britain, and at least three times, possibly and probably more, the per capita real income of France. Well, in this country, we've come to accept the fact of the progressive income tax, that people with a larger real income, the per capita income, can bear a larger percentage tax without necessarily any greater psychic sacrifice. I submit, therefore, that in view of the fact that our real income per capita is twice that of Great Britain, three times that of France, it is not disproportionate for us to spend one-sixth of this per capita income on our month as compared to one-ninth in Great Britain and in France. In short, the conclusion to which I come, at least, is that in view of the importance of the stake, in view of the inadequacy of air and sea power alone, in view of the contributions which Europe is already making and to which Europe is pledged under the Brussels Agreement, that it is proper for us to send these four added divisions to Europe and to stand beside them if a land attack occurs. Now, the terms of reference which Mr. Douglas gave me were that we were to discuss relationships between Europe and the United States primarily. In fact, there was nothing else mentioned in the covering letter and covering telegram. But I know how impossible it is to confine any discussion of foreign affairs at this time purely to Western Europe. And perhaps this is all right, although it's sometimes rather difficult to deal with because as you try to discuss one subject, you find other parts of the globe being brought in. But since it is a global struggle, I think perhaps it's appropriate to say a few words at least about Asia. I want to say that this program of defending, helping to defend Western Europe, in no sense implies any abandonment of Asia. I'm not here to make a party speech or to defend the present administration. I like to think for myself, and I like to believe at least, that I take my positions independently of the line of my party. But I think it is appropriate to point out that the administration, which with the aid of many splendid Republicans, has come to the defense of Western Europe, is also the same administration which came to the defense of Korea. And I know that act was questioned at the time both on its constitutionality and afterwards on its wisdom. It still seems to me to have been a fundamentally wise procedure because if we had not done so, inevitably all of Asia would have fallen and the feeling of discouragement and of defeat would have leaked over into Europe and it might well have been the spark precipitating in advance in Europe. We have achieved great things in Korea at real cost to be sure. We have destroyed the North Korean army. We are rapidly chewing up the Chinese Communist army. We have saved Indochina, at least with the present, from attack and preserved the Malay Peninsula. We are splitting the Chinese people away from the Chinese Communist government and from their Russian masters. And we are vindicating the principle of collective security. The mistakes made in the military conduct of the war, I wish that the other members of the United Nations had stood beside us and stood beside the United Nations somewhat more loyally, both in their contributions of troops and in their willingness to apply economic sanctions to the aggressors. But on the whole, the job is being done. I do not wish to launch a discussion as to the precise steps, the next steps to be taken in Asia. I think that's outside the terms of reference which Mr. Douglas gave us. But I do wish to say most strongly that it does not in any sense mean that the adoption of a strong policy in Europe does not in any sense mean the abandonment of Asia. On the contrary, the two are faces of the same policy, which is to resist aggression wherever it occurs, provided only the two conditions are meant. In the first place, that the place is accessible. We have not taken up the cause of Tibet. Tibet's too inaccessible place to reach. And provided in the second place that other nations make a substantial and an equitable contribution to the common defense. I think that's the American policy. I think it's the policy which the American people are agreeing. I think it is the crystallization which is coming out of the so-called great debate which started in Europe and then moved to Asia in which tomorrow, who knows, may transfer itself to Asia Minor. But it's in this typically American process we're getting at a meeting of minds. In a sense, what I've been saying tonight seems to me somewhat old hat. that is a policy to which the great mass of Americans have agreed. I think we're now rapidly coming to an agreement on Asia. Quite obvious that the American government is now committed, and I approve it, and have urged it as a matter of fact for some months, committed to a program of trying to overthrow the present Chinese Communist government. but to overthrow it not by landing troops or bombing Chinese civilians, but by giving aid to those forces inside of China which are willing to take up arms in defense of themselves so that we will be a liberating force and not an imperialistic force. Now, as I say, I think the American people are coming to these common decisions and one part of this attempt to reach a synthesis, I personally welcome this assembly and express my gratitude and having been permitted to make my poor and inadequate contribution to your deliberations. Now cede this stage to my brilliant, able colleague, Senator Pat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
