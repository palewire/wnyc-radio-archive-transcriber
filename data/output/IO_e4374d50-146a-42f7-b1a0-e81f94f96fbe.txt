Dr. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I have this. Thank you. Thank you. Who will I will do you, people. aware of the function they serve in bringing these needs into being. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to present to you the Commissioner of Department of Public Works, the Honorable Frederick H. Zermuller. Dr. Mahoney, Reverend clergy, Mr. Deputy Mayor, Mr. Board President, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, and children. I particularly stress the children because I know that many of these doctors can talk to you grown-ups better than I can. Somewheres in my reading life, I've read a book by Samuel Butler, and its name was Erwan. Now, if you pronounce or spell that word, you would find that it is the word nowhere spelled backwards. And in that book, he describes a mythical land in which the greatest crime against society in that land was to be in poor health. If you didn't take care of your health in Erwan, you were put in jail. And that's one of the reasons why we build these health centers, to be put in jail for being in poor health would be an amusing idea. But it is true that a person who neglects his health, if he has the means and the opportunity to take care of it, is neglecting not only his own best interests, but he is neglecting the interests of his family, the ones whom he holds dear, and also of the society in which he lives. As a result of poor health, he must be absent from work, his income is affected, his family is affected, and the whole society loses the benefit of his productive capacity. Now, this applies particularly in the case of communicable diseases. The interest of society in that case is very obvious. These health centers are preventative medicine, as I understand it. And while I'm an engineer, if I were a doctor, I think my interest would be in preventive medicine. For health centers such as we are dedicating here today, are the evidence of the deep concern which your city has as the agent of society in a great society in a great metropolis. It is evidence of the great interest the city manifests in the health of its people. Health centers such as this are physical proof, visible proof, that each of us is affected if any of us suffer or can be prevented from suffering. I hope that all you good people will take full advantage of the facilities of this up-to-date health center. There is available here the very latest techniques in preventative medicine so that all who desire them have the opportunity to take care of their health in their own interest and the interest of their society in general. I congratulate the health department on this completion of this center and I have the pleasure of turning over to the deputy mayor at this time the key to the building and that ends our job in the department of public works. Thank you. Now it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you the deputy mayor of the city, Mr. Charles Horlitz. Commissioner Mahoney, Reverend Clergy, Borough President Wagner, Commissioner Zermuelen, other distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen. Standing here in the shadow of the great James Weldon Johnson housing project which represents one of many thousands of housing units erected by the city of New York for the health, convenience, and comfort of its people and standing in the shadow also of this great structure. As the official representative of Mayor Vincent Impeletari, I deem it a great pleasure and a privilege to participate with you in the dedication of the enlarged health center which is being opened here today. I bring you the very warm and personal greetings of Mayor Impeletari and express to you his keen personal regret and his inability to be with you this afternoon. But you may be assured that in spirit he is with you and that he will continue his efforts and renew with vigor the fight that is being made to relieve the conditions in this city that call for the construction of more health centers of this type and character. Commissioner Mahoney has alluded to the fact that in this gathering are many whose place of origin is the great country of Puerto Rico. Today I bring to you from the far distant shores of Puerto Rico a message of the governor of Puerto Rico who likewise I am sure is with us in spirit today. He writes to Mayor Impeletari as follows. My dear Mayor Impeletari, it is with real interest and pleasure that I learned that the New York City Department of Health is opening its remodeled and greatly enlarged district health center in East Harlem in the past two years. We are interested in the past two years of the past two years of the past two years and the past two years of the past two years of the past two years of the past two years of the past two years We are interested because we know that this district health center service serves the health needs of more than 200,000 persons of whom approximately 70,000 are New Yorkers of Puerto Rican origin. We know that the East Harlem District Health Center gives child health service, tuberculosis services, social hygiene services, health education, nutrition education, and many other services designed to protect and promote the health and well-being of the residents of East Harlem. Certainly I, as Governor of Puerto Rico, want to urge all of the New Yorkers of Puerto Rican origin who live in this district to take full advantage of the services of your Department of Health and that which it offers and also to urge all of them to cooperate and work with the Department of Health in protecting and promoting the health of themselves and all New Yorkers. I know that the people of Puerto Rico join with me in recognizing the opening of this magnificent district health center as but one sign of the enduring friendship and understanding that exists between the people of New York and the people of our island. Cordially yours, Today, we will be organized by President Harris. Two new days Of Guy혓s World China become the city-wide system of health centers of the Department of Health. Those centers now bring the many services of our Department of Health directly to the people of the city in their own neighborhood. When it was opened, the East Harlem Health Center was described as a pioneer experiment in the development of local cooperation in matters of health involving citizens. Voluntary Health and Welfare organizations and the Department of Health. One of the purposes of that pioneer effort was to measure the value of such cooperation. The value of that program which began here has been tremendous and it is still growing. Since the first health center was open 30 years ago, we have made tremendous strides in improving and in maintaining the health of the people of our city. Those strides have been made under the guidance and leadership of your Department of Health. The public imagination is caught and held by reports about new wonder drugs such as penicillin and the antibiotics. I would like you to realize that some of the achievements of your health department in the last 30 years have been as dramatic, as striking, as anything achieved by the discovery of any new wonder drug. Let me take just two examples, diphtheria and typhoid. In 1921, the year the East Harlem Health Center was opened, more than 15,000 New York City children were stricken by diphtheria. Almost 900 of them died. So far this year, there have been but 14 cases of diphtheria and exactly one death from that disease. Many of us here are old enough to remember when diphtheria was the most dread scourge of childhood, when every year thousands of children were stricken and hundreds died. Today, and this is largely due to the leadership and work of the Department of Health, diphtheria has been all but eradicated from our city. Now let us talk of typhoid fever. In 1921, 899 persons were hit by that disease. 123 of them died. So far this year, there have been only 82 cases and not a single typhoid death. This disease, too, has yielded to the constant vigilance and to the never-ceasing work of your Department of Health. I could go on citing achievement after achievement of your health department, but there are still big health problems which face our city and our people. Ours was one of the first cities to undertake a systematic fight against tuberculosis. That fight has not yet been won, but the ravages of the disease have been reduced. And this fight, like those against diphtheria and typhoid, will ultimately be won. Our Department of Hospitals, as you know, has played an important part in the development and use of a new drug with which to fight tuberculosis. That helps to bring nearer the day of complete victory over the white plague. When our doctors and scientists eradicate the epidemic diseases, new problems arise. Those problems mainly concern the diseases and afflictions of middle age and later life. Such diseases as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Here in this new health center, in addition to all the regular services of the department, there will be a center detection, a cancer detection prevention center. The cancer detection prevention center here will be one of a chain of such centers throughout the city where all knowledge and skills we have for fighting this disease will be put at the service of the people. This is a magnificent structure designed to be used to meet the new needs of this community of East Harlem. But to me, the heart of the service here lies in the people who work in this building. The doctors and nurses, the sanitarians and laboratory technicians, and all the others with special skills and high devotion to their tasks. For we must always remember that wicked and evil men as well as good and devoted men can build great buildings. It is not the building that matters alone, but the use to which it is put. This building is but a place in which people can work at the high task of saving and guarding life, at the great work of building health. In formally opening this new and remodeled East Harlem District Health Center, we dedicate an institution of service. An institution which will serve our people and our way of life. The part of any one of us that we may play might be very small, but the total purpose and the total effect is great. It is your building to be used by you and your servants of the health department to serve great purposes. And in conclusion, I want to take this opportunity of extending the appreciation of Mayor Impeletere and the 8 million people of the City of New York. And the congratulations and the congratulations to Commissioner Mahoney, to Commissioner Zermullin, and to all who have participated in the bringing about of this wonderful contribution to the improvement of the health conditions of East Harlem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Mayor. The next speaker will address in Spanish, Reverend Father James McSherry of St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church. Father McSherry. Thank you. valley Israel or of Nuestra Señora de Monte Carmel, or of Santa Cecilia, or of all the saints, and see the monks teaching and trying to make their children good citizens. They are very interested in it. We are interested in it. We are interested in it. It is worth the eye of God. We want you to appreciate it. I hope it is so. But at the same time that we are interested in His soul, we are interested in His body. That His body is strong, vigorously and healthy. And why do we not need to be interested in His body? Our Lord was interested in His body. Georgia says ves the passage of Jesus into theamen in Galilee. A writer saw him reflect how he was on the one's was paid. Thanks for judging on the windows, gave the eye of the haunted complexity and hearing the windows. sanando a los lepresos. Él estaba interesado y también nosotros. Y por eso somos muy felices en esta ocasión cuando se abre esta oficina de la salud. Es una bendición para esta vecindad. Aquí bien vendrá la madre con su niño y el médico y la enfermera examinarán el cuerpo inoculando contra los microbios y administrando la medicina en una palabra protegiendo la salud de esta vecindad. Por eso somos muy felices y queremos dar gracias a todos los que han hecho este día posible. Queremos dar gracias al presidente de la oficina de Manhattan, al alcalde de Nueva York, al comisionado de salud, a sus ayudantes, al arquitecto, a la contratista y a los obreros. Todos lo que han hecho este día posible, queremos dar gracias y esperemos que Dios les bendiga. Ojalá que esta oficina guardando el cuerpo suba los pensamientos de la gente al alma y al Dios. Que Dios les bendiga. Señor Horowitz, y Mr. Mahoney, Mr. Wagner, y todos los que han hecho este día posible, Señor, yo, the people of this section of Parliament, wish to express our thanks to you, and in return, we hope it will bring many blessings upon this neighborhood and that it will be the means of making better and better citizens of this people of Parliament. May God bless you. Thank you, Father McSherry. I should like now to bring Deputy Mayor Horowitz back to the microphone for just a moment. Commissioner Mahoney, it is my great privilege and pleasure to now present to you the key which will open the doors to this great health center, which I know will bring a great deal of alleviation of the troubles and pains of suffering of the people of East Harlem and bring to them education in the field of good health. Thank you very much, sir. I shall take a good deal of pleasure in turning this key to Dr. Ayers, who is and will continue, we hope, for a long time to serve as the District Health Officer for East Harlem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I'd like to thank very much the sanitation band for their courtesy. Thank you.
