which is merely a strip the planes will land and take off on after all these seats are removed. The problem of getting you in here and to make it convenient for hundreds of thousands of people was a real job. And I want to take my leave tonight by thanking those who were responsible. The engineers, the directors, and all the magnificent staff that I have that have worked out every detail, together with those that have put up the tents and all other mechanical agencies that were engaged in this work. The tents, as you might have noticed, the red tents, I mean, were development of the war and there is no center pole. They stand up there on a cantilever system that is of great importance to the future use of tents in connection with emergency matters. I'd like to take this particular moment to thank Tom Compier, who stands on my left, who is the director of this international exposition, and all the members of his staff. If I were to go through all of the individuals and call them by name and tell you what particular part in this operation they played, it would take hours. But suffice it to say that I salute Mr. Tom Compier, who directed this operation, the air operation, and his very efficient staff. Together with the staff of the Mayor's Committee, those attached to the General Office, and to the Chairman personally. I have issued a statement that reads as follows, which I wanted to give you before you read it in the press, if the press has space for it. The greatest air demonstration in the history of world aviation is at an end. The International Air Exposition of New York's International Airport, Idlewild, has been an outstanding success in every respect. Sixty percent adverse weather reduced the attendance, but this was a risk that always is a factor in such outdoor exposition. The people have had an opportunity to review the nation's great air services. The people also had an opportunity to witness the fine cooperation and coordination of the city's services, as well as the police, fire, sanitation, hospital departments, board of transportation. There also has been fine assistance from citizen cooperation. As Chairman of the Mayor's Committee, which sponsored the International Air Exposition, I want to express my sincere thanks to all who have made the event such an outstanding success. I also wish to express my personal gratitude to the Air Force, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Army, the Coast Guard. As always, they demonstrated their service to our beloved country. Further expressions of gratitude go to the British Royal Navy and the British Royal Air Force, who participated in the exposition so successfully. Assistance and cooperation also was given by the Canadian Air Cadet League, the United States Civil Aeronautics Administration, the United States Civil Air Patrol, Al Williams, the famous flyer, and owners of civilian planes and helicopters. All of us, I know, feel a greater sense of security as a result of this great demonstration of air power and availability. In these disturbing times, it is good to know that the air power of the nation is on guard and ready for any emergency. All of us, grateful to Mayor William O'Dryer, whose personal attendance and assistance were so valuable and inspiring, he was ably assisted by the members of the Board of Estimate and the members of his cabinet. and to the people of New York and vicinity and other visitors from far away, the Mayor's Committee wishes to express its thanks for their support and cooperation. It has been a privilege to serve them. The next phase of the Golden Anniversary Commemoration will be the Golden Anniversary Exposition at Grand Central Palace, August 23 to September 19. This will be worthy to stand beside, side by side, with the New York at Work demonstration and the International Air Exposition. Finally, our thanks and deep appreciation to the newspapers, to the reporters, photographers, and editors, the newsreels, their editors, cameramen, the radio station, the managers and commentators, and the television station, their managers and cameramen, who gave so wonderful, such wonderful coverage to the exposition. On opening day, combined, they gave the International Air Exposition the greatest coverage in word and picture reported, recorded, in our country's glorious history. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will now have the mask band take over for a few numbers while we conclude and close our final ceremony. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, for being so intervene. Thank you.
