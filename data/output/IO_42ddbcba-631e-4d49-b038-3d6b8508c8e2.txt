UNYC now brings you a special program in celebration of Finland's Independence Day. Our program this evening will feature music by Finnish composers well known in their native land, though unfamiliar to most of us. Before we begin the musical portion of our program, we wish to tell our listeners that by special arrangement, this program is being recorded and will be flown to Finland, where it will be rebroadcast through the facilities of the Finnish broadcasting system. The music of Jan Sibelius has become as familiar to American audiences as it is to the people of Finland. His seven symphonies are part of the standard repertory of major orchestral associations in every part of the world. His long-awaited Eighth Symphony is to have its American premiere this season. Serge Krzyzewicki, an ardent champion of contemporary music, will conduct the new work in Symphony Hall in Boston. We hear first the Kuliki Suite for piano as performed by Edward Weiss. When Mr. Weiss toured Europe, he visited Helsinki, where he met Sibelius, who presented him with his complete works for piano. The Kuliki Suite was among them. Now, Edward Weiss performing the Kuliki Suite by Jan Sibelius. The Kuliki Suite by Jan Sibelius. The Kuliki Suite by Jan Sibelius. The Kuliki Suite by Jan Sibelius.

School of the Vienna Conservatory. Known as a versatile singer, she has sung with leading orchestras in Europe and the United States. We hear her tonight in a group of songs by Finnish composers. Miss Orasto sings Mariata's Cradle Song by Kula. Mariata, a beggar woman, sits in her bitter cold hut on a winter evening, rocking her child. She sings, don't look at the stars, don't listen to the wind, sleep. She fears that the child will freeze to death, but the baby quiets down and falls asleep. She sings, don't look at the stars, but the baby is still alive. She sings, don't look at the stars, proofed with makeup. They say, did you learn a sadật? They say, do you want to laugh at the others? How could you think to me? But they didn't take it down to the stars, so you want to tell me how, how it goes?

For her fourth and concluding number by a Finnish composer, Miss Orasto sings Marvia's Lover's Promise. The text, quite whimsical, a young man promises if he could get just the girl he wants, he would pamper her in every way. Buy her all that she desires. A new wrap every week and a new fur coat every winter. We're in a nacional of lack. We使in a broth3. The יכול is the fighting for women may come up to my own center.
