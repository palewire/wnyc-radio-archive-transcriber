Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scurney of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased, indeed, to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. and Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the Mayor and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it is with profound commotion that I have heard your words affectionate and cordiales revolting to my modest person and to the noble city that I have here the honor of represent. There are everyodge and there are which choices women have their own experience. So when in Europe she came to your country in我們 sheha only hunting whole format to all us. Ghosts are Hallo's way all thanks to Christopher Colombo, this is everytime from the confluence of my fuegas population, a connected with the land of the America, but Iowa assentate to the Grenovesian 의� Very important. ...of the democracy that is so expensive to the United States, but so expensive, so expensive to the Italians, especially the Genovese. For this, on.Peniteri, we are grateful for her, because she was a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, and so every citizen of the American, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come to the high level of representative of the city. So, this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of the courtesia, on.Peniteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States, and his mayor, who has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. This italian cannot be whispered out of its We are profoundly grateful because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made for us to give us democratic libertarians when we have intervened so presently in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men. So today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocination of democracy and have operated intelligently because we have to defend the democracy in Europe and really in the world. And that is, Mr. President of New York, it is with this faith that we are in the world because democratic liberties are really filled to the underworld and there is peace and work for everyone. This has been our challenge for us. For this time we, at least Italian, we would not have understood that the democracy in Italy, is just the moment we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We were lost in the territory in which our work could be exploited, but the power of this democratic force was so alive that we had taken our work. We worked, we worked, we worked desperately, to rebuild our country and materialize our country. It is with these sentiments, on the other hand, that I salute you and the city of New York and say that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in searching your own land is an example to all the genoveses. The tenacious, not credulous, contrasting every man and the events of the world, this man knew that this great land existed and looked at it desperately. He went to the river and looked at the river and looked at it everywhere, looking at it everywhere, looking at it, that he wanted to find it for a place to join the world with the Christian cross. And, well, it doesn't matter if he then found the passage, it doesn't matter if each one of us found the passage, if we have to persist, others will find the way, the way to find the way, for everyone to be free, in peace and work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which mean so much to us and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities which is with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties but we have been working hard to this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe that in spite of all difficulties we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first but in the end we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go. Let's go.
