And now from Gershwin's Forgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Borey, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. I've Got Plenty of Nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, got no mule, got no misery. The folks with dead, be a plan, got no luck on the door. Pray somebody's a-goin' to rob them, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? I've got a lot on the door, that's the way to be. Take it to the cross on the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got plenty of nothing for me. I've got my gal, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got the sun, got the moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of money, got to pray all the day. Keeps the plenty, you know how to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of rise. Never want me long, and I'm well. Never want to strive to be gone, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm the Lord? I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Beth.
