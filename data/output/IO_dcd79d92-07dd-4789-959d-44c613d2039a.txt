Mutual continues its coverage of the war. In Chongqing, the Chinese High Command announced tonight that 30,000 Japanese were killed and wounded at Changsha Sunday in a battle in which the Japanese offensive against that Hunan province capital was turned into a catastrophic debacle. Japanese conquerors waged a reign of terror against white residents of Manila tonight, threatening to shoot any of them found on the streets and imposing especially harsh restrictions on American citizens. The Navy, meanwhile, officially denied Japanese claims that 17 American destroyers, 25 submarines, and one aircraft carrier were trapped in Manila Bay, branding such claims as enemy propaganda. Launching their second aerial assault on Corregidor in 24 hours, Japanese bombers blasted at the island fortress at the entrance to Manila Bay for half an hour. Four JAP planes were shot down by Corregidor's anti-aircraft defenses. And that's the news from here. WOR is broadcasting news summaries on the hour and half hour, 24 hours a day. Remember Pearl Harbor. Keep them rolling. Good evening. Good evening. This is Clifton Fatterman opening the ninth in this series of programs of information and entertainment brought to you every Sunday by the Office for Emergency Management in cooperation with WOR and Mutual. Now our entertainment is made up of song and drama dedicated to what we're fighting for and why. Our information is an effort to answer the question, what can I do to help? Well, there are ways in which each and every American can and should help, with money and with time. With money we can buy defense bonds and stamps and keep on buying them. With time we can devote ourselves to some important phase of civilian defense, as does our guest of honor this evening, Frederick R. Hazard, the pioneer director of observation posts in the state of Rhode Island. Also with us are such representative Americans as the distinguished dramatic star of stage and screen, Raymond Massey. One of 10 Pan Alley's most talented tunesmiths, Irving Caesar. Radio celebrated young composer, conductor Morton Gould and his orchestra. You know, we've often heard that civilian defense is largely a matter of morale. Well, morale means confidence in ourselves and in our leaders. And confidence means that we know that they know what they should know. Morton Gould puts it all in a nutshell as the orchestra plays, I Know That You Know. Well,落 holes in volcanic river, Å E느�dee Quay The End The End The End The End Civilian defense, of course, consists of a multitude of precautions against air raids, for example. I guess most of us think of aircraft spotters as highly trained specialists with owl eyes and elephant memories. But Fritz Hazard has developed a system and written a series of manuals that can make a spotter of almost anyone. His civilian aircraft warning service in Rhode Island is considered tops. Now, Mr. Hazard, I have difficulty distinguishing a robin from a crow. Think you can make an aircraft spotter out of me? I think so, Mr. Padiman. A year ago, I had difficulty distinguishing a flying barn door from a bomber. Oh, I can do that now. A bomber hasn't any horses behind it. Correct. A bomber's horses are all out front, several thousand of them. That's one way to tell a bomber. By its multiple motors and by its size. It has long, narrow wings and a long, thin fuselage or body. Bombers are big ships. And fighters are little ones? Relatively, yes. A pursuit ship is short and stubby. Its wingspan isn't half that of a bomber. That's for easy maneuvering. If it had long wings like a bomber, they'd be torn out by the roots in making a turn at 350 miles an hour. Put it this way. A bomber looks like a two-wing dragonfly and a pursuit ship looks like a horsefly. Horsefly of another color, obviously. How about color? Can you identify a plane by its markings? Not unless it's flying very low and very close. And most bombing attacks are made at dawn or dusk when colors are hard to make out. The silhouette is the best guide. Every type of plane has its own distinctive silhouette. We start, observers, with the three basic types. Fighters? Bombers and transports. Let's see. The horsefly, the dragonfly and... The grasshopper. Ever see a grasshopper in flight? He has long, broad wings and a fat body. That's the troop transport to a T. T for transport. And for troops, Mr. Fadiman. Parachute troops. That's what the transport plane carries. Well, now I know how to identify those three basic types. Does that make me a qualified aircraft spotter? Mr. Fadiman, you have now mastered the first page of the first chapter in the elementary manual. There are nine chapters in that manual and there are three manuals. Well, too much homework for me. Before you are fully qualified spotter, you must be able to identify by their silhouette at least 80 out of 100 different planes. Boy, you've got to be a wizard. Well, I was giving you the works, Mr. Fadiman. That would qualify you as an expert, an observer first class. But anyone who can identify the three basic types can help a great deal. All he needs is keen eyes, a pair of binoculars, and the ability to note details. Sounds to me like an ornithologist. You know, one of those folks who always see the first robin and the last single-breasted tic-tac. As a matter of fact, ornithologists make ideal aircraft spotters. We could use a lot of them. They have an eye for significant detail and an ear for individual songs. You mean that an airplane sings? Ask any pilot. Every motor has its own tune. The other day, a man from the 152nd observation squadron stood with me in a closed hangar and correctly identified 10 planes in succession by the sound of their motor. Thank you, Lord, Ford, Mr. Hazard. And I'll take off my hat to the observers who can do things like that. Anyone who really wants to can learn the elements of spotting. Let me say this. Every civilian observer who qualifies himself for this job is doing as much for defense as though he were piloting one of our interceptor planes. He's right on the first line of defense against attack from the air. He's just as much on active duty as if he were in uniform. Without his guidance, the pilots would be relatively blind. In a large measure, we are depending on his eyes for our final victory. And, Mr. Hazard, the eyes will have it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We've heard from Mr. Hazard what happens before the air raid alarm is sounded. Now let's see what happens, or should happen, when the alarm sounds. We're going to say it with music. Now most of you have heard the helpful safety songs of Irving Caesar, which have been sung by schoolchildren all over America. Well, Mr. Caesar has now written a group of safety songs for wartime, and he's going to sing some of them for you. Ladies and gentlemen, Irving Caesar. Listen, my children, and you shall know what to do and where to go when you hear the siren blow, sounding the air alarm. If you should hear that siren snort, one long blast and one that's short, that means danger of a sort. But you needn't come to harm. First of all, don't scream or shout. Just be calm. Don't rush about to a shelter. Walk with care. The air raid warden will take you there. All this advice I give to you. English children, practice too. Follow these rules, and if you do, you'll have your good luck charm. Listen, all mothers, to you, I say, if a parade should come by day, from the school please stay away, teachers know what to do. And a parade should come by night, shut off the gas, turn out the light. Then you won't give a plane in flight, one little sight of you. Food and water should be near, radio for you to hear. Stay there till the sirens blast with short, short signals that danger's past. Mothers, although your hearts may ache, and lots of courage it may ache, be brave, it's for your children's sake. Your courage will see you through. Thank you. That's the stuff, Irving. Too bad you're having some good, uh, sound air raid advice for the grown-ups in our audience. Yep, I certainly have. And it's this. Shake hands with your air raid warden, He's the man to know. Walk up to him and say, Mr. Warden, I'll obey. Tell me what to do and where to go. Make friends with your air raid warden, He's a friend indeed. He's gentle and he's kind, he has safety on his mind. Follow him wherever he may lead. Air raid warden is a phrase that's new, And that may need explaining. Warden means protector, And every warden gets special training. Shake hands with your air raid warden, Hero without gun. A loyal volunteer, we need at home right here, Until the war is won. Until the war is won. While we've been discussing civilian effort here tonight, We've not spoken a word about our fundamental strength, Our passion for freedom. The celebrated radio writer Arch Oberlo wrote a play about freedom, And what it means to have it, And particularly what it means to lose it. Tonight we bring you that play as directed by Arthur Curlin, And performed by the distinguished American dramatic star, Raymond Massey. And featuring Otto Preminger, And a notable Broadway cast. Ladies and gentlemen, This precious freedom. Morgan! Yes, sir? Can't you make this crate of mine go faster? Yes, sir. Ah, that's better. Well, I for one am going to be glad to get back in harness again. I talked to my wife for the last ten years about cutting myself off from civilization, And having a real vacation, and now... Morgan, what's the matter? Oil line open! I'd sure... Take it easy, Mr. Stevenson, we're okay, Just fasten your safety belt. Where are you going to land? Where? Field ahead. Hold on, don't be afraid. Don't be a fool. I've been in forced landings before. All I want is to get down there fast. Oh, I want is to get down there fast. What? What? That's better. I'll get back to you. They'll call you. You know, you know you're going to do a great thing. I'll get back to you. And then I'll get back to you. And I'll get you. I've got to get to the city. I've got to get back to my business. Guess there's no one home, Mr. Stevenson. No one in the fields, no one to help us. Fine end to a vacation. Guess we'd better try to flag a ride into town. Wait a minute. Huh? Someone's coming. Well, how do you do? You just had a forced landing out on one of your fields, and I... Wait a minute. Who are you? I don't see what the earthly difference that makes. All I want is to use your telephone. Go away. Why, you... Morgan, did you see that? Slam the door in my face. Yeah. In my face, infernal fool. What could you possibly have been thinking? I don't know, Mr. Stevenson, but that guy was awful scared.
