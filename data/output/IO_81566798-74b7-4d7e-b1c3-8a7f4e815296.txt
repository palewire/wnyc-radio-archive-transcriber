By transcription. Hello there. Let's speak American. Let's speak American with our neighbors, the Pareth family. They're pretty new to our city, you know. They came here from a Spanish-speaking country not too long ago. And like all of our foreign-born neighbors, they're finding life in New York kind of different from their life back home. The surroundings are different, the customs are different, and the language, well, that's certainly different. But suppose we join the Pareth family right now as they learn that it's better sure than sorry. The post office is not very far from here, Mama. How will you know it, Elvera? There is a flag outside. Besides, I saw a lot of mailmen coming out of the building one morning when I was going to school. There is an American flag on the building? Yes, Mama. The post office is an important government building. Do you see it on the next block? See, I see it. It is near the corner. Elvera, do you think we should register the letter? Why, Mama? Mama, is it important? See, it is important. I am sending something very special. Then you should send it by registered mail. But what is so important? The letter is to Argentina, isn't it? I am sending home some money. Mama, you should not send money in a letter. Why not? I always do. Sometimes I register the letter. But, Mama, don't you know there is a special method of sending money? You should send a money order. It is much safer than in a letter. For Argentina also? Yes, Mama. There is a special way of sending money inside or outside of the United States. But I will ask the man at the post office. He will... Oh, Mama! What is the trouble, Elvera? I have something in my eye. Oh, let me see it. I can't... I cannot open my eye. Oh, sir. I... I have a handkerchief. Let me see it, Elvera. Please, Mama. I can't. Oh, what can I do? I don't know, Mama. I don't know. It feels terrible. Can you see a drugstore on the corner? There. See, Elvera. There is a drugstore. Come fast. Hi there. What's the rush? It's Peter Corwin. Hello, Peter. Is something wrong? Oh, Peter. I got something in my eye. Maybe you can help, Peter? Maybe. Here, let me see if I can find it. Hold still now. I can't stand still. It hurts me so much. Well, now, just try to relax for a minute. Take a deep breath. Now another. Here. Here is a handkerchief, Peter. Oh, good. Mine's not so clean. Now, let me see. Which eye is it, left or right? The left. Okay. Now I take the eyelid and turn it so. Ah, I see it. Now, just a minute and I'll have it out. There. How's that? I don't know. It still hurts me. Oh, you'll be all right. How did you do that, Peter? How did you turn the eye? Well, I didn't turn the eye, Mrs. Pereth. Only the eyelid. I learned that in my first aid class. Comes in handy, too. What? Elvira, what's the matter? Why are you crying? I don't know why. I can't help it. Oh, let's see if we can do something about that, too. How about a soda? We were just going to the post office. Where do you want to go, Peter? Just to the drugstore. For a soda? Uh-huh. Right at the corner. Okay? It is all right, I guess. You go to the drugstore and I will go to the post office. I think it's too late. This neighborhood post office closes at five and it's, let me see, ten after already. But I must send the letter. Mama, it isn't a letter, remember? See, I remember. I will go tomorrow and talk to the man at the post office. You can go with my mother tomorrow. Mom's sending some packages to Europe. I did not know you have a family in Europe. Well, we don't. They're friends in England and in Germany. And Pop sends some packages to a family in Italy. People he's never even met. Really? Uh-huh. They're people who need help. A very large family. Do they write your Papa letters? Yes, lots of letters. The only trouble is the letters are in Italian. What do you do if they are in another language? Oh, Pop knows Italian. He used to live in Italy before he was married. He did not tell us he speaks Italian. Well, maybe it's a little rusty these days. I don't know. He doesn't talk about it much. Italy, I mean. It's Papa. What is the trouble? Just a fire somewhere, Mrs. Craig. A fire? And the police cars? They go to a fire also? They always go along. Might be something important. But how do they know there is a fire someplace? Somebody must have called them, Mama. Or else they gave the alarm. They gave the alarm? You mean they call for help? Well, in a way they do. They use the fire box. What is this fire box? Well, let's see now. There's one on the other side of the street. You see that post with the orange light on top of it? Oh, si. Well, wherever there's a light like that, every few blocks, I guess, there's a fire box. What do you do with the box? Well, in an emergency, you break the glass and pull down the handle. That gives the signal at the firehouse. Then you just wait for the fire engines to come, and you tell them where the fire is. That is all you do? That's all. You just wait for them. But if you call the fire department and there's no fire, oh boy, you better watch out. There's a fine for that. A fine? Yes, you have to pay them for taking the trucks and the men out of the firehouse when it wasn't necessary. After all, while they were out, some house might really be on fire and there would be no one to help. I remember a friend of mine once had to pay... That's a long story. Let's go and have that soda. It'll be almost time for supper. Is it all right, Mama Sita? Si. Yes. It is all right. I will go home. Do not be late, Elvira. We will not be late. Hasta la vista. Bye now. In here, Elvira. I hope Mama will be all right. Why not? She is very nervous. And all our talk about the fire and... And what? Well, this is the first time that she has permitted me to go out with a boy. We're not going out, Elvira. We're just having a soda. I don't know. Mama is funny. She doesn't like me to be with a boy. What's wrong with it? There is nothing wrong. Only it is not the costume. Not where we come from. Where do you want to sit, Elvira? Right here. Okay. Mountain. What do you have? Vanilla soda, please. Okay. I think I'll have chocolate. What are the big heads? Ice cream sodas. One vanilla and one chocolate. Sorry, no chocolate. We're all out of it. You got walnut? No, all out of walnut. How about strawberry? I don't like strawberry. How about banana? A special today. Sold. One vanilla and one banana. Come and I... You know, it is very strange. What? Banana ice cream? No. Not the ice cream, Peter. That is wonderful. I mean, American drugstores. Why? Don't you like them? Yes. But it is funny. It does not look like a drugstore. And it does not even smell like a drugstore. Ah, but it is a drugstore. How do you know? Well, because they sell medicines and other things for sick people. You see that booth back there? Yes. Well, that's where the druggist is. It is true. But look at us. We sit at a counter. Yep. We can have ice cream or coffee or soup or sandwiches. Sure. That's because a lot of people come here for lunch. See? They even have tables over there. Yes. And on the other side, there is a counter of cigarettes and candy and chewing gum. And over there, perfume. And there are books and telephones. Well, one vanilla soda and one banana split. I ordered a banana soda, not a sundae. But I guess it's all right. How about some water? Sure. It's all right now. I can still change it, you know. Ah, never mind. I'll take it. I haven't had one in a long time. Would you like to try some of my sundae, Elvira? No, thank you. This is very good. Don't you think it is funny, Peter, that we can have ice cream in the winter? Yeah, I guess so. I never thought about it much. You eat a lot of ice cream, don't you? I guess I do. I like it. Here you are, the water. Here's the check. Thank you. Do I pay you here? No, at the door. You know, where I come from, a drugstore is a real drugstore. It is usually small, almost dark, and very quiet. And ours are big, light, and not so quiet. Yes. In ours, there is an atmosphere of dignity. Sounds strange to me. This place could be a restaurant, or a bookstore, or a tobacco store. It is strange to call it a drugstore, when there is so much here. Well, it's probably a carryover from the old days. What do you mean, Peter? A carryover? Well, you see, I mean it probably comes down from the days when, well, when little towns in America had the general store. And what is that? Well, a general store had everything. There was often only one store in a town, and they had food, clothing, and tobacco there. It was a good place for the old boys, a kind of social club where they'd come in and talk, or sit around the stove, playing cards. Aren't there any stores like that now? I guess there are in little towns. Well, maybe out west or in the south. I really don't know. You know, Peter, there are stores like that in Argentina. So many wonderful things in one big store. Well, we still have stores, something like the general store in the city. Like, um, like the food market where Mom shops. That is a strange custom, too. The way people shop in this country. Why do you say that? There are so many self-service stores, even restaurants, like the, the cafeteria in school. Yes, and usually they're cheaper, even though the quality is pretty good. Sometimes very good. By the way, uh, how's the eye? Why, I forgot all about it. Good. You know, you might have had to go to the hospital. You are joking, no? Why, no. Oh, but that's nothing to worry about. Uh, did you ever go to a hospital? No, I was never sick. That's good. I was in one, let me see now, for about three months once, when I played football. Uh, finished? Yes, I am. But, Peter, why do you talk about a hospital? I thought you only had to come to the doctor here in the drugstore. No, the drug is tear-ismed, doctor. So, well, he would have sent you to see a doctor in the hospital, uh, two blocks away. I am glad you could help me. So am I. Come on, let's go. I'll walk you home. But, Peter, we live in the same house. Well, what do you know? Isn't that convenient? And so our friends have had another experience as they adjust to a new life in New York. On our next program, the Pareth family finds out we cannot tell a lie. So join us then, won't you? And let's speak American once again with our foreign-born neighbors. Today's script, Better Sure Than Sorry, was written by Maria Nowoszowska and was transcribed by the WNYE players under the direction of Florence Monroe.
