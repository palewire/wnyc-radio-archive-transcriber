The vote in Harlem now is 5-1 in favor of Stevenson, and likewise for me. This is a clear mandate from these people that they must have the civil rights, and if any party, mine or Republican, expects to have the Negro vote in the future, they've got to come through with a clear-cut program of deeds and not promises right down the line on civil rights. This is Congressman Greenwood speaking from Long Island. Now, this decision has been made by the voters. In this campaign, there seems to be, in our district, a contest between a slogan, Ike likes diving against my record of service not only in Washington, but throughout the whole of my life. The slogan won out. I'm not complaining, as this is evident of the way our people wanted this to be. That is the American way. Now, I do believe there has been a tendency in this election, whereby money has been used extravagantly, to win elections. I hope that tendency can be overcome. I hope also that the new administration in Washington can bring peace to our beloved country, that men will think their differences for the welfare of the nation as a whole. Thank you very much.
