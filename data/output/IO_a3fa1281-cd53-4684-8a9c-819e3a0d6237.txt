The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay Here I can hear the wind I To fight the lead I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am near at the front To fight the foe Give the soldier boys a marching And I can no longer stay I hear the beautiful calling Goodbye, darling, pray Come on now, sound Way, way down south Where the sun shines every day Soft skies of blue shine down anew And all the birds are singing Clear and clear and gay Come on, come on along Come on, join in the song Jump on, but it won't be long We're on our way Hip hip hooray We're going down south To there Handsome snakes The heart grow thunder That is why I long for you Lone through the night I thunder Wondering, darling, if you're true Lone through the night I thunder Wondering, darling, if you're true Distance only lands and shams there Though the ocean waves divide Absence makes the heart grow thunder Longing to be near your side Longing to be near your side Be near your side She was happy till she met you And the fault is all your own If she wishes to forget you You will please leave her alone She has come to her old mother Just because there is no other She'll be happy She'll be happy In her own sweet home When the harvest days are over Yes, we do Christ, we do Your hope When the harvest days are over, Jesse, dear, my Jesse. The crazy one's off with a strong-headed dog, And the band played on. He's like a plummeted flower, And the trail he adored as the band played on. When his brain was so loaded, It nearly exploded. The poor girl would shake me along. He carries a girl with the ball-earing ground, And the band played on. Sweet Adeline, My Adeline, At night, dear heart, At night, dear heart, For you I find, For you I find, In all my dreams, In all my dreams, Your fair-faced bees, Your fair-faced bees, Your fair-faced bees, Your fair-faced bees, You're the flower of my heart, Sweet Adeline, Sweet Adeline, With all my dreams, With all my dreams, Without your dreams, Your fair-faced bees, He's only a man in a fearless pain A beautiful sight to fear You may think he's happy and free from care He's not about his things to be He's done when you think of a wasted life For you cannot make me wait And her beauty was sold For an old man's gold She's a bird in a given day A little brown car A shady green spark So happy home I find My heart's barely gone I love only one She's the girl I have to be mine Just one girl Only just one girl Well, I know what I know But there's not my heart But, oh, hey She is just one day I'll be happy forever With just one friend I'll be happy for the country Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonder Wonderï¿½ The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Makes my happiness complete Makes me fodder at your feet Sweet Marie Where did you get that hat?
