Commissioner, Commissioner, to the care, The New York, the New York, and the New York, not only, but the New York, are not have been, much aboard, has been recognized by the establishment of the new Tropical Disease Laboratory. The development of the new Cancer Detection Center will bring closer the victory over one of the greatest killers of all. We at the New York Medical College are proud to be a part of this program devoted to the people of the city of New York, and we pledge ourselves to continued cooperation in keeping with the high ideals and motives long established by the city of New York. I thank you. Thank you, Dr. Snyder. I wonder if now you will join with us in a moment of prayer led by the rabbi, Elias Solomon of the Young Men Hebrew Association. Dr. Solomon. Father of mercy, look down from thy holy habitation on this center dedicated to the noble purpose of healing the afflicted of thy children. Thou art the divine healer, the source of goodness and mercy, and thou hast implanted in our hearts the spirit of compassion for all living things. Grant that all men become aware of their common brotherhood and feel for their suffering fellows, regardless of race, color, and creed, and recognize that all men brothers be, all men thy children. Even as thy prophet exhorts us, have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us? Bless these our leaders, lay and clerical, who set the pace and example for all of us in the field of humanitarian endeavor. Bout save thy protection to our beloved country. Grant wisdom to the heads of our government, national, state, and municipal, and happiness to all its inhabitants. Render thou effective, we pray thee, the deliberations and labors of the United Nations to the end that the world may be firmly and surely set on the road to peace, prosperity, and salvation forevermore. Amen. The history of the city of New York is largely that of recurring waves of migrations of people, all activated by exactly the same motive in coming to America and in coming to New York to improve their status in life. Those various waves of migration have left their imprint upon the present city. Many of the men in public life today have sprung from the first great wave of migration, which was the Irish, followed by the German, then the Jewish, then the Italian, each one contributing an enormous amount, making an enormous contribution to the government and the welfare of the great city. we are now in the midst of another wave of migration. Into the portals of this building which we are opening today will pass Puerto Rican and Negro youngsters who may in themselves or who may give rise to the future officials of the city of New York. There is no way which we can underestimate the potential of these various waves of migrations of people which come into the greater city, all of which leave their mark upon it. It now gives me great pleasure to introduce to you Dr. Raphael A. Marine of the Mayor's Committee on Puerto Rican Affairs. Dr. Marine. Commissioner Mahoney, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, some 25 or so years ago we were fortunate enough to have this health center established in our neighborhood. As a matter of fact, it was the first health center ever established in the city of New York. I'm certain that the men and women who made this selection were well aware at that time of the social and economic conditions which made the establishment of such a center necessary and even urgent. During those many years under the leadership of doctors like Dr. Rabinov and other distinguished health officers the center became a vital part of the neighborhood. Slowly but steadily the people of the neighborhood began to realize that in the staff of the center they have friends patient friends understanding friends who we must admit were faced with problems entirely different from the ones that were used to. The motley complexion of the neighborhood the language difficulties made it not an easy job for the members of the staff to try to give service to the neighborhood and to solve the plenty problems both medical and even social that come up in an institution like this. Today we have a renovated center a much larger center services have been expanded new services have been added it is now associated with a medical school we could almost say that this is a miniature medical center and as a member of the people of this neighborhood I want to tell or I want to say to all those who had anything to do with the reopening of the center that the people of this neighborhood are very grateful and that they are well aware of the gift which has been made to them. I have this to say to the people of the neighborhood a center like this cannot really be a success unless the people of the neighborhood lend it all its cooperation it is necessary that the people realize the many services of which they can avail themselves in such a center it is important that they come to this center before it is too late in this center we have one of the most progressive institutions today when it comes to such things as curative and preventive medicine in the field of diseases in the field of cancer in the field of tuberculosis and in other medical fields I therefore wish to express to all our thanks for such a reopening thank you thank you very much dr. marine in bringing into being a building of this kind it's relatively simple matter for the medical staff of the health department to put on paper the many things which they desire to have in order to function smoothly and effectively in the medical field it remains however for a different department of the city government to bring that building into being in this respect the city of New York is extremely fortunate and I'm sure the department of health is extremely fortunate in having associated with it in the city government a department of public works which is keenly alive to the needs of the health department and keenly aware of the function they serve in bringing these needs into being it gives me a great deal of pleasure to present to you the commissioner of department of public works the honorable Frederick H. Zermuller Dr. Mahoney Reverend clergy Mr. Deputy Mayor Mr. Board President distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen and children I particularly stress the children because I know that many of these doctors can talk to you grown ups better than I can somewhere in my reading life I've read a book by Samuel Butler and its name was Erwan now if you pronounce or spell that word you would find that it is the word nowhere spelled backwards and in that book he describes a mythical land in which the greatest crime against society in that land was to be in poor health if you didn't take care of your health in Erwan you were put in jail and that's one of the reasons why we build these health centers to be put in jail for being in poor health would be an amusing idea but it is true that a person who neglects his health if he has the means and the opportunity to take care of it is neglecting not only his own best interests but he is neglecting the interests of his family the ones whom he holds dear and also of the society in which he lives as a result of poor health he must be absent from work his income is affected his family is affected and the whole society loses the benefit of his productive capacity now this applies particularly in the case of communicable diseases the interest of society in that case is very obvious these health centers are preventative medicine as I understand it and while I'm an engineer if I were a doctor I think my interest would be in preventative medicine for health centers such as we are dedicating here today are the evidence of the deep concern which your city has as the agent of society in a great metropolis it is evidence of the great interest the city manifests in the health of its people health centers such as this are visible proof that each of us is affected if any of us suffer or can be prevented from suffering I hope that all you good people will take full advantage of the facilities of this up-to-date health center there is available here the very latest techniques in preventative medicine so that all who desire them have the opportunity to take care of their health health in their own interest and the interest of their society in general I congratulate the health department on this completion of this center and I have the pleasure of turning over to the deputy mayor at this time the key to the building and that ends our job in the department of public works thank you now it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you the deputy mayor of the city Mr. Charles Horowitz commissioner Mahoney reverend clergy borough president Wagner commissioner Zermuelen other distinguished guests and ladies and gentlemen standing here in the shadow of the great James Weldon Johnson housing project which represents one of many thousands of housing units erected by the city of New York for the health convenience and comfort of its people and standing in the shadow also of this great structure as the official representative of mayor Vincent Impeletari I deem it a great pleasure and a privilege to participate with you in the dedication of the enlarged health center which is being opened here today I bring you the very warm and personal greetings of mayor Impeletari and express to you his keen personal regret and his inability to be with you this afternoon but you may be assured that in spirit he is with you and that he will continue his efforts and renew with vigor the fight that is being made to relieve the conditions in this city that call for the construction of more health centers of this type and character commissioner Mahoney has alluded to the fact that in this gathering are many whose place of origin is the great country of Puerto Rico today I bring to you from the far distant shores of Puerto Rico a message of the governor of Puerto Rico who likewise I am sure is with us in spirit today he writes to Mayor Impelitari as follows my dear Mayor Impelitari it is with real interest and pleasure that I learned that the New York City Department of Health is opening its remodeled and greatly enlarged district health center in East Harlem at ceremonies on Monday October 27 1952 we are interested because we know that this district health center service serves the health needs of more than 200,000 persons of whom approximately 70,000 are New Yorkers of Puerto Rican origin we know that the East Harlem District Health Center gives child health service tuberculosis services social hygiene services health education nutrition education and many other services designed to protect and promote the health and well-being of the residents of East Harlem certainly I as governor of Puerto Rico want to urge all of the New Yorkers of Puerto Rican origin who live in this district to take full advantage of the services of your Department of Health and that which it offers and also to urge all of them to cooperate and work with the Department of Health in protecting and promoting the health of themselves and all New Yorkers I know that the people of Puerto Rico join with me in recognizing the opening of this magnificent district health center as but one sign of the enduring friendship and understanding that exists between the people of New York and the people of our island cordially yours Louis Minos Marin governor of Puerto Rico 31 years ago a program was begun on this site which has grown and spread to every section of our city in 1921 the East Harlem Health Center was opened here it was the first of what has become the citywide system of health centers of the Department of Health those centers now bring the many services of our Department of Health directly to the people of the city in their own neighborhood when it was opened the East Harlem Health Center was described as a pioneer experiment in the development of local cooperation in matters of health involving citizens voluntary health and welfare organizations and the Department of Health one of the purposes of that pioneer effort was to measure the value of such cooperation the value of that program which began here has been tremendous this and it is still growing since the first health center was opened 30 years ago we have made tremendous strides in improving and in maintaining the health of the people of our city those strides have been made under the guidance and leadership of your Department of Health the public imagination is caught and held by reports about new wonder drugs such as penicillin and the antibiotics I would like you to realize that some of the achievements of your health department in the last 30 years have been as dramatic as striking as anything achieved by the discovery of any new wonder drug let me take just two examples diphtheria and typhoid in 1921 the year the East Harlem Health Center was opened more than 15,000 New York City children were stricken by diphtheria almost 900 of them died so far this year there have been but 14 cases of diphtheria and exactly one death from that disease many of us here are old enough to remember when diphtheria was the most dread scourge of childhood when every year thousands of children were stricken and hundreds died today and this is largely due to the leadership and work of the Department of Health diphtheria has been all but eradicated from our city now let us talk of typhoid fever in 1921 899 persons were hit by that disease 123 of them died so far this year there have been only 82 cases and not a single typhoid death this disease too has yielded to the constant vigilance and to the never-ceasing work of your Department of Health I could go on citing achievement after achievement of your health department but there are still big health problems which face our city and our people ours was one of the first cities to undertake a systematic fight against tuberculosis that fight has not yet been won but the ravages of the disease have been reduced and this fight like those against diphtheria and typhoid will ultimately be won our Department of Hospitals as you know has played an important part in the development and use of a new drug with which to fight tuberculosis that helps to bring nearer the day of complete victory over the white plague when our doctors and scientists eradicate the epidemic diseases new problems arise those problems mainly concern the diseases and afflictions of middle age and later life such diseases as cancer heart disease and diabetes here in this new health center in addition to all the regular services of the department there will be a center detection a cancer detection prevention center the cancer detection prevention center here will be one of a chain of such centers throughout the city where all knowledge and skills we have for fighting this disease will be put at the service of the people this is a magnificent structure designed to be used to meet the new needs of this community of East Harlem but to me the heart of the service here lies in the people who work in this building the doctors and nurses the sanitarians and laboratory technicians and all the others with special skills and high devotion to their tasks for we must always remember that wicked and evil men as well as good and devoted men can build great buildings it is not the building that matters alone but the use to which it is put this building is but a place in which people can work at the high task of saving and guarding life at the great work of building health informally opening this new and remodeled East Harlem District Health Center we dedicate an institution of service an institution which will serve our people and our way of life the part of any one of us that we may play might be very small but the total purpose and the total effect is great it is your building to be used by you and your servants of the health department to serve great purposes and in conclusion I want to take this opportunity of extending the appreciation of Mayor Impeletary and the 8 million people of the city of New York and the congratulations and felicitations to Commissioner Mahoney to Commissioner Zermuelin and to all who have participated in the bringing about of this wonderful contribution to the improvement of the health conditions of East Harlem thank you thank you very much Mr. Deputy Mayor the next speaker will

Por ellos, ellas están muy interesados, y nosotros también. Nosotros estamos interesados en su alma. Su alma vale mucho en los ojos de Dios. Queremos que usted aprecie su alma. Ojalá que sea así. Pero, al mismo tiempo que estamos interesados en su alma, estamos interesados en su cuerpo. Que su cuerpo sea fuerte, vigoroso, saludable. Y por qué nosotros no debemos interesarnos en su cuerpo. Nuestro Señor estaba muy interesado en su cuerpo. Lea el Evangelio. Y vea cómo él viajaba por las calles de Galilea, dando la vista a los ciegos, oído a los tordos. Él habla a los mudos, sanando a los lepresos. Él estaba interesado, y también nosotros. Él va a ser feliz. Y por eso, somos muy felices en esta ocasión, cuando se abre esta oficina de la salud. Es una bendición para esta vecindad. Aquí vendrá la madre con su niño. Y el médico y la enfermera examinarán el cuerpo, inoculando contra los microbios, y administrando la medicina, en una palabra, protegiendo la salud de esta vecindad. Por eso, somos muy felices, y queremos dar gracias a todos los que han hecho este día posible. Queremos dar gracias al presidente de la oficina de Manhattan, al alcalde de Nueva York, al comisionado de salud, a sus ayudantes, al arquitecto, a la contratista, y a los obreros. Todos los que han hecho este día posible, queremos dar gracias, y esperemos que Dios les bendiga. Ojalá que esta oficina, guardando el cuerpo, suba los pensamientos de la gente al alma y al Dios. Que Dios les bendiga. Señor Horowitz, y Mr. Mahoney, Mr. Wagner, y todos los que han hecho este día posible, todos los que han hecho este día posible, nos, los que han hecho este día posible, queremos expresar gracias a ustedes.
