And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Borey, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothin'. The End Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their feet at the feet, down a lock on the door, pray somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in' more. What for? What for? What for? What for? I've got no luck on the door, that's the way to be. They can feel the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that are tied, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gals, got my gals, got my lor, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got the sun, got the moon, got the people see. The folks with plenty of money, got to pray all the day. Keep the plenty, you're not a warrior, keep the devil away. Away, away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time to cry. Never want me long in the world, never want me to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, for heaven's a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gals, got my gals, got my lor, got my lor. Got my lor. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Bet.
