Ok. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. In the Bronx, you'll remember, we had an estimated 47,000 customers without electricity. 8,000 of those customers have been restored this morning, and leaving 29,000 still without service. Would you care to say, sir, just when service will be restored to that borough completely, or have you no definite idea? Well, we have announced earlier this morning that we expect to have service restored to practically all our customers by tonight. It's impossible to be more specific than that at this time. In the borough of Brooklyn, where we had 260,000 customers without service, we have restored electricity to nearly half of those, leaving 132,000 still without service at 10 o'clock this morning. In the borough of Queens, where 100,000 customers were affected by company estimates, there are still 71,000 without service at 10 o'clock. Of course, we have emergency crews in the field, and are pending every effort to restore service as promptly as possible. We had a message before from you concerning action to be taken by the people of the city of New York who are subscribers to Con Edison. Well, we would like to repeat that it would help us a great deal if customers would report their lack of service only once. Every time a report is made, a ticket is filled out, and it would increase our paperwork if customers called more than once. Ladies and gentlemen, you've been listening to a report from Con Edison on the power situation in New York at the present time. We will keep you fully informed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

All right. All right.
