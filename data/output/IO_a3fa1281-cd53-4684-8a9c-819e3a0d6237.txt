The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay in the morning but no longer It breaks my heart to go. Something tells me I am needed at the front to fight the foe. Leave us, soldier boys, on marching and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, fall in, it won't be long. We're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray! We're going down south, full day. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the night I've thunder. Wandering, darling, is your true. Distance only lands and shone's land. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you. And the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, You will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother Just because there is no other. She'll be happy till she'll be happy In her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, Yes, she'll be near, Yes, she'll be near, Yes, she'll be near, And the sun gets flowers blue, He dies so clear, He dies so clear. You will keep the word you said, That's the time we do shall wait. When the harvest days are over, Yes, she'll be near, My, she'll be near. The day we would come with a strawberry dog, And the plant stayed on. He's life off the floor, With a trail he adored, As the plant stayed on. But his brain was so loaded, It nearly exploded, The poor girl would shake me along. He carries the girl with a strawberry brown, But the plant stayed on. Sweet Adeline, Sweet Adeline, Sweet Adeline, My Adeline, My Adeline, At night, dear heart, Dear heart, for you I find. In all my dreams, your fair face be. Your fair face be. You're the flower of my heart. Sweet as a night, sweet as a heart. He's only a man in a fearless pain. A beautiful sight to fear. You may think he's happy and free from care. He's not the most he seems to be. He's done when you think of a wasted life. For you shall not make me wait. And her beauty was sold for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a given day. A little brown car, a shady green spot. So happier home I find. My heart's barely gone, I love only one. She's the girl I have to be mine. Just one girl, only just one girl. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian.
