The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications, as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of the Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the Merchant Marine and has served on the Italian Committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life, I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of the world. Thank you. too. Thank you. Thank you, you, by the way, my honor of my own admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the city of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight, in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world, express to you through this presentation of the city's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the city of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeletere is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Plotuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor. And bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. And now here again, Mr. Coleman. Mayor of Genoa. Onorevole Sindaco di New York, E' con profonda compometer e con profonda commozione che ho ascoltato le sue parole affettuose e cordiali rivolte alla mia modesta persona e rivolte alla nobile città che ho qui l'onore di rappresentare. There are facts and acts that are made by men and every act that man has a unique meaning. But there are acts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is come to Europe and is come to my city, she has not made only a good visit to all of us. She has also made homage to the mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is also come to Genova ambassador of democracy. She has been so expensive to the people of America, but so expensive to the Italians and to the Genoveses, especially. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, for which every citizen of American, independent of its origin and social class, can come to her, as she has been to, to high degrees representative of the city. So, this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and its own that has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is, above all, the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic and has contributed to the rest of the country, and has been given to the support of this country and the people of the United States and the great people of the United States, and the great people of the United States, which we are deeply grateful for, because we know all the sacrifices that this country has made this country to rid ourselves of democratic democratic freedom when we have intervened so presently in the war and to protect them today with many material sacrifices and men, so that today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently to defend democracy in Europe and to defend it in the world. And, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work, because the democratic democratic freedom are really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For some time we are not understanding, we must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy was just when we were trapped in the weight of the competition. In the city of Hitler, we were lost in the city of Kare, we were lost in the city of the world, in which we could exploit our work, misery and ruin, but the attack of this force, this democratic democracy was so alive that we had taken up our work, we had worked, we had worked, we had to work, we had to work, to build moral and material our country. It is with these sentiments, on. Impiniteri, that I salute you and the city of New York and say that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa, the tenacious of Colombo in searching your own land is an example to all the Genoveses. Deriso, non creduto, contrastato da ogni avversità, dagli uomini e dagli avvenimenti, quest'uomo sapeva che questa grande terra esisteva e l'ha cercata disperatamente e andato sondando alle foci dei fiumi e andato cercando negli estuari, ovunque, cercando quel passaggio che lui voleva trovare per congiungere tutto il mondo sotto la croce cristiana. Ebbene, non importa se lui poi non ha trovato il passaggio, non importa se ognuno di noi non trova il passaggio, bisogna persistere altri, troverà la strada, la strada perché tutto il mondo sia libero in pace e nel lavoro. Applausi Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Jenner, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which means so much to us and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first but in the end we shall succeed, we shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
