Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. The . . . The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The National Anthem of Italy and the National Anthem of our own country very brightly played by the New York City Police Department band. Now here is Mr. Coleman. Yes. Mayor Impoletari, it is my distinct honor and privilege today to present to you and through you to the people of the city of New York the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of Genoa, Italy. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great Admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The Mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications, as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has, on many occasions, proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. applause This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Skirney of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the city of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the city of New York that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world expressed to you through this presentation of the city's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the city of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's Gold Medal of Honor on Mayor Vittorio Plotuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the city hall plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Petuzio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it's with profound commotion that I've heard your words affectionate and cordiales revolting to my modest person and to the noble city that I the honor to represent.

She also gave her homage to the city of Christopho Colombo and this was sent to the recognition of the genoese population so connected to the land of America. But she, especially on the name of Imperiteri, she was also been in the Genoa ambasciatore of democracy. ...of that democracy that is so dear to the United States, but so dear to the Italians, especially to the Genoese. For this, on the Imperiteri, we were grateful for her, because she was a witness and document of the democracy that lives in the United States and the United States, for which every citizen American, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to to high degrees representative of the city. So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, the Honorable Imperiteri. This visit is the name of the city of Christopho Colombo to the most great city of the United States and to the his mayor, which has had such great success in Genoa and Italy. It is also the affirmation of a man of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic and has contributed to the rest of the country to the rest of the country. This is the salute of this man and the population of the United States, the great people of the United States, the United States, which we are deeply grateful for because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made up to rid ourselves of democratic democratic freedom when we have intervened so potent in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men so today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in all the world. Well, the Honorable Imperiteri the Honorable Sindaco of New York it is with this faith that we work because the democratic democratic freedom are really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For sometimes we Italians we don't understand. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is happened right in the moment when we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We have lost the country in which our work could be destroyed. We are not going to die but the power of this freedom and this faith democratic is so alive that we have taken the work we have taken it. We are working we are working we are working we are working to create a world and material we are working and with our country we are working with these feelings on the other that I salute you and the city of New York and I tell you that we are we are working in the work of of the democracy of our country we are tenacious and people in technology we have some examples and there are some examples of ourmaître the miaAMM who are doncs to look for both the very different facts We are ży Way by every hand and I have these things that we are thinking and Clint and he looked at it desperately, and went to the river, and went to the river, and went to the estuary, everywhere, looking for the passage that he wanted to find for all the world under the cross, and then, it doesn't matter if he then found the passage, it doesn't matter if each one of us doesn't find the passage, if he needs to persist, others will find the way, the way so that everyone is free, in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York, and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for, and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy, with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great man which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. Of course! Thank you. La la la la, la la la la la, it's an old Italian phrase. La la la la, la la la la la, every little manina, there's the very first name. Every street signorina, said it the very same way. These funny little words don't really mean a thing. It's just a phrase that nowadays Italians love to sing. Oh, see, oh, la la la, it's a wonderful word, la la la la. If anyone asks you how you are, it's proper to sing. Oh, see, oh, la la la. Oh, see, oh, la la la. If the ladies should ask you if you care, you don't have a start, a love affair, say, oh, see, oh, la la la. Does it mean yes or no? Does it mean no? Well, yes and no. Cause see, oh, la la la. Get together and sing, oh, la la la. It's easy to say, so try today. And I just think on the sea, come on, sir. Oh, see, oh, la la la. Oh, la la la la. Oh, la la la.
