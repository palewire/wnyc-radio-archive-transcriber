Today the Salvation Army commemorates its 31st annual Prison Sunday. In 1,200 penal institutions throughout the United States, the Army of Peace, with its brilliant flags, its uniforms, and its sounding brasses, has brought its message of friendship and goodwill to thousands of men and women, many of whom have half forgotten, if they ever knew, the meaning of goodwill and friendship. Tonight, Station WNYC brings you the Salvation Army's Brooklyn Citadel Band and male chorus in a program of Salvation Army music, under the direction of Captain Edward Lowcock. They will start their broadcast with a Salvation Army march, victors acclaimed by Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell Coles. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ You just heard the Brooklyn Citadel Band of the Salvation Army playing the march victors acclaimed. As its next number, the band will play a meditation based on two hymn tunes. Oh, love that will not let me go, and Master, let me walk with thee. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ At the shots of praise Comrades, lift your voices Love your anthem, praise Hunt, hunt, hunt, hunt Onward, resistant soldiers Hunt, hunt, hunt, hunt, hunt Looking unto Jesus Who is God before Like a mighty army Move the church of God Comrades we are treading Where the saints have gone We are not divided Oh, a body we've won In hope and doctrine One in charity Hunt, hunt, hunt, hunt Hunt, hunt, hunt, hunt Hunt, hunt, hunt Hunt, hunt, hunt Looking unto Jesus Who is God before Here in the studio this evening Is the head of the Salvation Army Women's Prison Bureau Major Dorothy Berry Who will tell you something About her work Major Berry Thank you, Mr. Child Nearly 60 years ago William Booth, our founder Said in writing of the Salvation Army's Work among convicted persons Our people, thank God Have never learned to regard A prisoner as a mere convict With a number instead of a name To us, he is a human being To be cared for and looked after As a mother looks after Her ailing child I suppose that was A rather appalling statement Back in the 19th century When a prison sentence Was pretty generally regarded As society's quite justifiable vengeance On those who had broken its laws However, things have changed since then And are still changing Each year we recognize more clearly That the purpose of our institutions Is not to get even with those Who have broken our laws Or to frighten them into obedience Rather, we must help them Become useful, contented human beings And strangely enough As our psychologists And caseworkers and penologists Increase their understanding Of the terrible loneliness The sense of being cut off From all warm human ties Which causes the delinquent To turn against society They come steadily closer To agreeing With the ideas Of William Booth They recognize The delinquent needs To be recognized In an individual Who can be reached And helped By patient good sense And understanding In the 11 states Of our eastern territory There are 212 penal institutions Which our officers visit At least once a month Holding religious services And interviewing all those Who want help and advice Often, too We are called into court When a prisoner needs help Or to be put in our care We also have in our charge Throughout the country Hundreds of parolees Whom we supervise And for whom we find Work and lodgings We do all these things Knowing if they are to have Any real and lasting value We must somehow win the trust And confidence of these people In such a way That we can help them To a better relationship With their fellows And to the deeper Religious understanding Which we believe Must be the source Of spiritual regeneration And growth Thank you, Major Berry For what you've told us About this great work Of the Salvation Army And now The Brooklyn Citadel Band Directed by Captain Edward Lowcock Will play The Star Lake March By Eric Ball By Eric Belvin The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End That of course was the beautiful Rock of Ages sung by the Brooklyn Citadel male chorus directed by Mr. Walter Orr. Now the Brooklyn Citadel band of the Salvation Army will play the Crusader's hymn, Beautiful Savior.
