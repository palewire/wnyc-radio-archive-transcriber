And love is plenty for me. I got no car, got no mule, got no misery. The folks with their kids and their kids, got a lock on the door. Great somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in' war. What for, what for? I got a lock on the door, there's no way to be. They can hear the drugs on the floor, there's no way to be. For the things that are tied, like the stars in the skies are on me. Oh, I got plenty of love here, and nothing's ready for me. I got my gal, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complainin'? I got my gal, got my lord, got my dog. I got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, got my gal. Love is plenty to all be. I got the sun, got the moon, got the people see. The folks with plenty of money, got to pray all the day. He's the plenty, you're not the warrior. I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time to rise. Never worry long, it's not well. Never want to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I got plenty of love here, and nothing's ready for me. I got my gal, got my dog, for heaven's a whole day long. Do you complainin'? Got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Bess.
