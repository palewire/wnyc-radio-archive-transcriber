The folks with plenty of plenty, got the great old days. Keeps the plenty, you know how to worry I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, and the time of life. Never want me long as I'm well. Never want to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell, are you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, for heaven's all day long. What are you complaining? Got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord.
