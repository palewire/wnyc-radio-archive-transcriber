Good afternoon. Your city station's microphones are located now at the Board of Estimate Room at City Hall for another on-the-spot coverage of a news event as it happens. This is the afternoon session of the transit hearings, which is being held before the three-man mediation board of Mayor Impeletere and being broadcast by WNYC. William J. McCormick is chairman of that board and will preside over this meeting. Others serving on the board with Mr. McCormick are Thomas A. Morgan and Theodore Keel. This morning there were four labor witnesses, Matthew Guinan, president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, Michael Quill, head of that CIO union, John F. O'Donnell, general counsel for the TWU, and James Gormley of the AFL Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric, Railway and Motor Coach employees. During this afternoon session, we understand that the counsel of the Board of Transportation, Mr. Harold Warner, will testify after we hear from some more representatives of labor. As yet our chairman, Mr. William J. McCormick, is not ready. We might mention that Mr. McCormick is the president of the Transit Mix Corporation, and that Thomas A. Morgan, another member of the mediation board, is chairman of the board of the Sperry Corporation. Theodore Keel, the third member, is the impartial chairman of the city's transit industry. The purpose of this hearing, Mayor Impeliteri has said, is to give both sides an opportunity to express their views on the dispute, which revolves not so much around the question of the 40-hour week, but the manner and procedures with which it might be brought into being. Under the Memorandum of Understanding, which was agreed to last June by the TWU and the board, the latter professed itself in agreement with the shorter work week for its 36,000 employees. The union, which represents the majority of workers in return, promised it would not resort to strike action for some two years. And now here is our chairman, Mr. William J. McCormick. We would now like to hear from the representative of Local 380, Municipal Transit Workers, A. F. L. AFL. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, Ladies and Gentlemen, George Matthews, Local 380, A. F. L. Municipal Transit Workers. workers gentlemen we the transit workers have received considerable publicity in the past two or three weeks I think it's unfair publicity in view of the various services in other city departments in the city of New York the Department of Water Gas and Electricity is a service the same as subway says it operates at a deficit we heard mention of a transit unit in the city of New York the Staten Island Ferry Service with the operation of nine ferries there is a loss of five million dollars compared to two million dollars two and a half million dollars in our vast transportation system they have recently purchased several ferries at a cost of six million five hundred thousand dollars these figures will only go to prove that the transport workers have received undue publicity for our just demands two and a half million compared to five we have local 380 see no reason why the Board of Transportation and the city of New York cannot introduce on the first of July this year for all transit workers 40 hours for 48 hours pay in that we include transit workers that are now working 45 hours 44 hours and anything less than 48 hours that they receive 48 hours pay for 40 hours work also the cities of Boston Los Angeles Washington and Pittsburgh have had this in effect for a year or more for the skilled workers we ask a 10% in for the unskilled workers we ask a 10% increase this is to aid them in carrying on their lives due to the rise in the cost of living as many things that I am going to bring out here this afternoon that are not pertinent to the fat 40 hours or the 11 cents and I based that on the memorandum of understanding the fourth whereas on page three the employees are entitled to a fair and adequate pay reasonable hours of work safe and suitable conditions development of opportunities for advancement facilities for fair and impartial consideration and review of grievances in other respects to proper employee relations policy and into the next whereas we ask as fair treatment for the employees that the top rate of pay be reached and you consider this in your report for all employees after one year this already exists for eight groups bonus pay for night work we presented that to the fact-finding board last year we also consider that a part of this will whereas we base that on a decision of the court of appeals as directed by the city of New York and computing the prevailing rate to include a bonus pay for night workers what happens in the board of transportation when this penalty is not applied an example I use this particular department no preference I do not desire any special credit for them I merely wish to refer to them as an example of other mechanics in the signal in the transportation system on an eight to four tour of duty you have 32 in the independent division 32 single maintainers in the maintenance division that's for the movement of trains the trains operate anywhere from 90 seconds to three at three minute intervals now an interval gentlemen is the space between trains time between trains after 7 p.m. 34 men two additional men the headway on this is approximately six to twelve minutes the better part of the tour the midnight tour we have 35 the trains are twelve minutes apart these men are essentially troubleshooters the maintenance work could be accomplished a good portion any portion of the day that's what happens when we do not have a bonus pay it will be no imposition on the board of transportation to institute the forty hours immediately for all mechanics I believe that the mechanics in a transit system should have been on forty hours week last July 1st and the rest of the transit employees should have been on forty hours now if the committee at that time had not suggested the engineers to study this with the result we are one year late in getting it we request request again from this committee as we have in the past before all committees that it be recommended to the mayor and the board of transportation that the prevailing rate be given to all mechanics in the transit system perhaps the board of transportation will tell you that there is litigation now going on by our union that is an expense to the taxpayer an imposition to the worker and an expense to the worker eventually the city of New York will have to pay to the transit mechanic the prevailing rate of wages the subterfuges they use many subterfuges to avoid meeting this situation it will be a tremendous expense on the city of New York but it will be only fair and just that a skilled mechanic receive his proper pay the subterfuges that I refer to a plumber that you might know and expect the work done in the transit system is known as a structure maintainer now you might assume that his work is just maintaining plumbing fixtures it is not it's the installation of material and new equipment in many points carpenters, masons, iron workers and so on and so forth they are listed under structure maintainer they are all skilled mechanics electricians we find as light maintainers and signal maintainers electrician as you know in your home there's a voltage of perhaps 110 to 250 volts in the subway system a light maintainer works on 600 his lighting system operates on 600 there's very little 110 the signal maintainer his work is on the tracks it's not in a newly constructed building and for all of these men there is a rate of $1.70 an hour compared to an outside rate of $3.25 an hour the city of New York in the Board of Transportation is losing its best mechanics many of them are leaving the Board of Transportation and going to other city departments many have left our union and have done so many are going into private industry to show you what has been done to replace this loss of mechanics in 1938 a man to secure his job as a mechanic by promotion and mind you all these jobs are by promotion there's very few open competitive examinations he has to say he had to serve at that time three years and one year in the subway now he can spend no time outside an experience just merely a vocational school training six months in the Board of Transportation and take a promotion examination to a mechanic I don't need to explain to you gentlemen what kind of a mechanic you will receive under those conditions the section 220 of the labor law the Board of Transportation has by various means avoided to pay this to the mechanics this is more important I believe to the interest in the interest of the transit system or equally important as the 40 hour and the 11 cents gentlemen I intended to talk longer here this afternoon but I was asked to keep it short I could give you many facts that would enlighten the subject but I believe if you study the report our report before the kill coal committee and our report before the Board of Transportation you will establish these facts and the transit worker will receive his 11 cents his 40 hour week and the prevailing wage will be on its way for the mechanics thank you that was George Matthews of local 380 of the AFL transit workers now back to our chairman Mr. Chairman Mr. Chairman Mr. Morgan Mr. Kiel gentlemen I'd like to thank you very kindly for inviting me here today to give our views with respect to the signalman and talman on the New York City transit system but before I continue with what I have to say I would like to correct an error that was made you sent me a telegram Mr. McCormick addressed as the general chairman of the Brotherhood Railroad Signament of America unfortunately the Brotherhood Railroad Signament of America no longer have jurisdiction on the New York City transit system the former membership of the Brotherhood Railroad Signament of America on the IRT and the BMT have decided to act as an independent group pending being picked up by another large labor organization that's in the very near future now you've heard a lot of data and presentations made here today and I would only be adding repetitious data if I was to tell you what I had offered to tell you today the committee that's here with me today in order to expedite these particular hearings have taken a vote I, Frank Nolan, the general chairman of the group representing Sigelman and Talman on the New York City transit system Emil Reich, the secretary and Anthony Simone, the chairman of the Talman's group heartily and 100% endorse the opening presentation made here before you gentlemen this morning anything that I might add to that would be repetitious as I said I know that you gentlemen know of what the Sigelman and Talman have to do on the New York City transit system because we submitted to you our particular brief many times in the past and we are conscious of the fact that you gentlemen of the highest skill will take into consideration what the outside industries have now in effect for all of their employees a 40 hour week and we leave it in your good hands to make the proper recommendation to the mayor to the board of estimate and to the board of transportation thank you very much gentlemen thank you very much gentlemen thank you very much gentlemen thank you very much gentlemen thank you very much gentlemen thank you very much gentlemen now I'd like to hear from the Civil Service Forum of New York City Robert W. Brady, President of the Civil Service Forum of New York City Mr. Chairman and members of the Mayor's Special Transit Committee in accordance with the provisions of the labor relations policy of the Board of Transportation which guarantees employees the right to be represented by organizations of their own choosing or to refrain from affiliation if they so desire the Civil Service Forum presented the program of its Transit Committee in relation to wages, hours and working conditions at the Transit Fact Finding Board hearing held for this organization on March 2, 1950 we told that committee that we urge the members of the Board to give every possible aid to their employees in order to promote peaceful negotiations and promote the general welfare it has been our constant belief that out of such hearings there should emerge an administrative program for equitable wages, improved working conditions, and a pattern of labor relations which may properly be described as the fruits of effective public official civil service employees peaceful and equitable relationship The Civil Service Forum, gentlemen, became a signatory to the Memorandum of Understanding on June 27, 1950 only after assurance by members of the Board of Transportation and Council to the Board that prior to the institution of the 40-hour week we would have an opportunity to discuss the means of transition and the effect on take-home pay including the 11 cents per hour increase we also reserved the right to question the legality of the check-off system and to seek mandatory legislation for improved vacation and sick leave allowances unfortunately, we were not the first organization called to review and accept the Memorandum of Understanding in its final form it had already been accepted by the majority organization and our only alternative was to agree with certain reservations acceptable to the Board or cease to be a party to an instrument which contained many factors proposed and incorporated in accordance with our program recommendations we feel confident that this committee will effectively assist transit employees to accomplish without further unnecessary delay a reduced work week without loss of jobs or wages we take this opportunity to again publicly express our appreciation to Mayor Vincent D'Arne-Pelteri and the members of this committee for the opportunity to be heard and we trust through your efforts there will emerge a genuine program to institute the five-day week for transit employees in a positive effective manner befitting the democratic administration of the New York City Rapid Transit System in accordance with the Civil Service law, the Rapid Transit Act, sound public administration and the moral law as it affects the employer-employee responsibilities to each other accordingly the Civil Service Forum of New York City affiliated with the Civil Service Forum of the State of New York wholeheartedly supports the recommendations of its Transit Committee which are respectfully submitted here with for your perusal consideration and we hope recommendation for adoption by the Board of Transportation and our Municipal Administration the shortening of the work week, gentlemen is a practice which has been universally adopted to give working men and women an opportunity to enjoy the comforts of their homes and families as well as to spread means of employment wherever it has been found necessary and desirable to do so Transit employees, with some exceptions, are heads of families and when we consider that the family and the family's fireside that guard given rights and constitutional guarantees to each individual who chooses to enjoy them are the real fundamental units of our American system of society, economy and government it behooves us to do all in our power to preserve such fundamental units from external influences and potential disintegration because of lack of opportunity or limited available time and the part of heads of families to share with their loved ones, their leisure, experiences, opinions and personal and public affairs and countless other duties of home which the reduced work week of 40 hours without reduction in present compensation will make possible Most governmental agencies are now operating for all intents and purposes on the 40 hour week or less without cutting the pay of their employees Sure it is, most of them are not charged with responsibility to serve the public 24 hours of the day When however, statutory responsibilities or financial or legal transactions require a sixth working day the staff is reduced or skeletonized at no additional cost and the employees enjoy what is tantamount to a five day week Where such responsibility as operating transit facilities exists the shorter work week can and must be instituted after a careful, sympathetic survey and the hiring of additional personnel if necessary Your concern and ours ought to be and undoubtedly is to see that essential services to the public are not impaired We believe our request can be granted without curtailment of these services Administrative and technical employees of the Board of now enjoy a reduced work week during the summer months The Civil Service Forum believes in economy and government and we contend and strenuously insist that it is proper to advocate economy but it is improper to use insincere excuses of economy or lack of insufficient revenue to deny and to deprive transit workers of their just requests for improved working conditions which have too long been denied The President's Emergency Board recognized this principle in labor management relations for some employees of the nation's railroads particularly with regard to the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company as far back as March 1949 That Board recommended an increase of 7 cents per hour and reduction of the work week from 48 to 40 hours with 48 hours pay This principle was also applied by the President's Emergency Board with regard to the wages and working conditions of employees of the American Express Agency We cite for your attention that the present Wage Stabilization Board has found it impossible to hold the line against increased compensation for employees and even in contracts where no escalator clause appeared increases in wages were granted as though such clauses were part of the contract in order to help the employees keep up with the ever-rising cost of living In this morning's press we note that the Wage Stabilization Board is about to fall back to a new line as reported to us by the New York Times It is expected that allowable general increases in labor cost over the base period of January 1950 will be raised to 13 percent By the same token, the Salary Standardization Board of the Federal Government is expected to afford similar treatment for employees under its jurisdiction Public employees must not be considered a group apart from the general makeup of the working class citizens and taxpayers who comprise the vast majority of our electorate when matters of wages and working conditions are to be considered by administrators of governmental agencies Time after time, we in public employment have witnessed the intervention of public officials in our own community in labor disputes between private industry and its workers Service to the community is the paramount consideration Track finding boards are appointed With very few exceptions the matter is resolved in favor of the employees and the increased cost is definitely passed on to the consumer whom we in civil service refer to as the public The civil service forum contends, gentlemen that there is a moral responsibility on the part of all government officials whether elective or appointive to recruit and retain an efficient, qualified and justly satisfied personnel This is not possible while civil service employees are saddled with the burdens of enforced economies due to limitations on public expenditures while their counterparts in private industry who perform the same or commensurate duties are granted salary adjustments and improved working conditions We sincerely hope that this committee before it is discharged from its duties will not only recommend but see to it that a five day, 40 hour week will be established in the Board of Transportation of the City of New York and that the employees will receive the rates of pay commensurate with the duties they perform as compared with similar services in private industry with due consideration to the constantly rising cost of living as indicated in the indexes of the United States Department of Labor We again thank you for the opportunity to be heard and for your kind attention and I ask that the rest of the time allotted to this organization be granted to Mr. Robert E. Kirkpatrick The Civil Service Forum will support the recommendations submitted by our transit representatives immediately following It will only take a few minutes Thank you Thank you, Mr. Brady Mr. Chairman Wait just a minute Who do you represent? I'm Transit Chairman of the Civil Service Forum My name is Robert E. Kirkpatrick Transit Chairman of the Civil Service Forum I've tried to confine my remarks to that of the 40 hour week and the transition there up From the outset, number one Transit Committee requests the 40 hour, five day week with no reduction in the present take home pay to be effective July the 1st, 1951 Number two, effective July the 1st, 1951 an overall increase of 10% based on the present rate of pay including the 11 cents granted in accordance with the memorandum of understanding That increase gentlemen has been more than ate up by the ever increasing cost of living and is also by the reduced purchasing power of the dollar U.S. government statistics indicate the need for a 10% increase in wages over the compensation received since July the 1st, 1950 Number three, we believe the Board of Transportation is in a position to grant the five day, 40 hour week For in our, it is our conviction that the revised schedule to initiate the reduced work week can be produced without delay by the Board for most departments particularly for the 6,700 administrative employees referred to in the Joint Engineers Report and also for the approximately number of 7,000 in cars and shops another approximate number of 6,500 employees in a maintenance of way in other words, a total of 20,000 employees could be placed on a revised five day, 40 hour week schedule at once with no loss of service to the public the cost is admitted in the report to be very slight For all other employees effective July the 1st we request the establishment of the five day, 40 hour week as the basis for salary and wage for all time work in excess of the 40 hour per week we recommend compensation at the rate of time and one half this cost for overtime should be added an added incentive to the Board to exhilarate the completion of the period of transmission to the five day, 40 hour week without unnecessary delay At this time, I'd like to point out it's our desire in the form to cooperate with the members of the Board in any way possible in order to reduce the work week and adjust the wages while at the same time endeavoring to economize wherever possible without loss of positions for present employees we ask this committee to go on record and reject any suggestion to the increased number of swing tricks they are undesirable and cause discontent to a number with the number of swing tricks with the cooperation of the members of the Board our organization has been able to bring these swing tricks down to a minimum and we urge your cooperation on rejecting any such offer in order to bring about any additional swing job thank you, the gentleman we'll now like to hear from Local 624 American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Workers pay it for now Mr. Chairman members of the committee my name is Joseph A. McCarthy representing the Local 624 American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employee I ask your indulgence the speaker that was supposed to be here today is ill and I am sort of pinch hitting for it when we appear before the fact-finding board two of our points in the program was a 40-hour week and the inequities of salary for supervisory employees and when the report was rendered on page 51 last paragraph I quote special claims were filed by several supervisory groups based on the inadequacy of their salaries when compared with the earnings of men whom they supervise or others in the workforce in view of the general nature of these proceedings and their basic conditions which we are undertaking to correct we do not deem it appropriate to pass on special claims of this character it is better to leave them for serious discussion on the property when they improve framework of labor relations which we are recommending accordingly these special claims are being reserved for direct consideration jointly by the management and unions involved if understanding is not reached there will be no interference with operations and certainly if the board will agree to submit the difference to an arbitrator for a thorough review on a suggestion and a suggested or advised resettling and then on page 71 or page 70 that's article 34 I guess annually rated employees particularly supervisors do not receive overtime pay although they perform overtime work they are therefore entitled to somewhat more in salary increase than the equivalent of the increase granted to hourly rated employees the special claims of some of the supervisory groups are not appropriately the subject matter of this specific recommendation in this report now when we signed a memorandum of understanding with the board we brought this up and it was agreed then that when we re-signed the memorandum that we would have a meeting with the board within 90 days seven months passed and we had not the board had not contacted our union for a discussion on this matter and the letter was written to the board on February the 7th asking for a hearing on this matter and we received a postal card from the board stating that it would be put on file we ask you this we ask your recommendation first that a 40 hour week be put into effect as soon as possible without a cut in pay and that you further recommend to the board that we be given a hearing to clear up these inequities of salaries thank you thank you now hear from general committee of adjustment brotherhood of locomotive engineers New York rapid transit lines general chairman Donovan Mr. Chairman Jeremiah Jeremiah Donovan Mr. Chairman Mr. Morgan Mr. Keel we represent the brother locomotive engineers on the New York Railroad three divisions 105 419 and 868 I will now turn over the mic to our special representative from the trunk line railroads Paul W. Hartnett Mr. Hartnett Mr. Chairman and members of this transit committee I have sat here today and listened to the presentation made to your group that reflects itself upon the transition to a 40 hour week for the transit employees the city of New York there isn't too much that I can add to that has not already been presented to you gentlemen in regards to the 40 hour week except to elaborate on a few points that I feel that possibly was overlooked it was brought to your attention that in the memorandum of understanding that there would be meetings held with the various labor representations and this committee or group known as consulting engineers in the report of the consulting engineers it states and they go to the extent of thanking not only the board of transportation but the several unions who assisted them in making their recommendations however to date today I haven't heard yet of any organization that actually sat down with the consulting engineers and prepared this report overtures were made they were made to this organization the overtures was made practically two weeks to the date that this report was given to the board of transportation the report was already drawn up its recommendations was already determined and there would be no necessity of any organization setting down to countersign something which has already been agreed upon the brother of locomotive engineers is a signatory to the memorandum of understanding on this subway lines but unwillingly so it's always been the understanding of this organization that any memorandum or agreement contracts or otherwise is something that is written or drawn up and agreed to by two parties not by one party the memorandum of understanding was drawn up conclusively and included no one else but the board of transportation this organization objected to that very strongly to our interpretations of the reports of the coal committee or the findings of the coal committee there could be no other essence taken out of that report except that the interested organizations would set down with the board of transportation and arrive at this memorandum of understanding which was not done we did sign it as I stated under protest this is not the first committee that this organization has appeared before and I don't suppose it will be the last after the report was given by the engineering department to the board of transportation we were asked to appear before the board of transportation under the date of May the 29th 1951 which we did to the full board of commissioners it was expressly expressed at that meeting that this report would lay on the table and the wish was expressed by the chairman and other members of the board of transportation that this transition of a 40 hour week should and could be done between meetings with the board of transportation and the organizations representing the employees in the New York rapid transit system and the board of transportation it has always been my contention that the people who run railroads or any other business know more about that business than any consulting engineering group the intent of this engineering survey as I understand it and explain was for the purpose of establishing a transition from the present 48 or 45 or 44 hour week to a 40 hour basis of employment nowhere in it did I find that it was to be hired as a set of efficiency experts for the elimination of work of employees this morning's presentation by one of the organizations representing transit employees the statement was made and I concur in it that a good much and a good many pardon the expression a good many of the crafts is still under man and yet the report says we'll eliminate the elimination of employees it reflects upon ourselves as a representatives of modem and naturally we are interested in modem and primarily but we are also interested in other employees I don't feel and I don't feel that any other representative any other organization feels that there is any over man jobs on the transit system in consideration of the people and the amount of people and revenue and traffic that is carried on the New York transit system one of the recommendations of this committee was the installation again of swing runs affecting motor men and conductors and I'll use the term motor men conductors because they are the men who are primarily responsible for the movement of trains and it is a movement of trains in which we are vitally interested the board or the engineering did not say just what they meant by swing runs but we who have represented transportation employees know what swing runs are these trains are operated on not to exceed eight hours and forty minutes from the time of reporting until the time of final sign off now there's very few swing runs employed in the city of New York and we don't wish to see any more put on if they must be put on this organization is strictly going to stay with the recommendations of the coal committee report of not over eight hours and forty minutes when we were asked to come down here today we really were not prepared to go into a full presentation of the problems of motor men but however in the presentations that have been made by the previous organizations here today I find that there is not only the transition of the forty hour week being discussed but a substantial increase in wages on January the 30th of this year we presented to the board of transportation a set of demands or recommendations that we felt that the motor men on the New York rapid transit system were entitled to again in May of this year on May the 29th and on June the 8th those same demands was placed before our honorable mayor I will present the same demands to this August body here today in line with that which has already been given by other organizations the primary responsibility of a motor man we feel entitles him to a differential of pay over and above other trained employees that has been our contention for many many years in fact since the date of unification in 1941 when unification became a factor in the city of New York a motor man was receiving 96 cents per hour and a conductor was receiving 75 car inspectors was receiving 88 cents an hour and tower man 80 cents an hour and tower man 80 cents an hour today that differential has practically disappeared much to the loss of the take home pay based upon the responsibility of earnings of a motor man we have made that presentation to the board and we make it to you now this myself on this committee is not prepared to give you copies of it now as I told you we were not prepared to reject a wage increase into this hearing however that shall be given to you within the next 48 hours I don't wish to take up any more of your time I don't feel it would be to any avail because what the engineers or the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers has considered the inequality of the craft they represent has been expressed to the coal committee has been expressed to the board of transportation and has been expressed to the mayor's office and the full request shall be given to this body as I state in the next two days the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers thanks your August body for the time you've given us and I don't feel that there is much more that we at this time can give to you in the line of information on the assignment that has been given to you by the mayor there's just one thing I want to ask or question if I may please Mr. Chairman ask will this organization and the other organizations be given the opportunity at any time before you make your final recommendations for a rebuttal on what might be offered by the Board of Transportation on the issues involved would be the intention to have executive sessions with them I see thank you that just about concludes the presentation of the other locomotive engineers and we ourselves as an organization hold ourselves ready at any time to prepare before this group I thank you we can move to the other two questions now I'll be in the next one I can just the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word the word now we'd like to hear that's take it's been heard from all the unions that have signed this memorandum of understanding now we would like to hear from the Board of Transportation the board the board has asked me to state its position to you in regard to the 40 hour week transition to the 40 hour week transition to the 40 hour week on the New York City transit system presents difficult problems as you know it's quite different from going to a 40 hour week in any commercial or manufacturing business because there you simply close down the office close down the plant on the sixth day and that's the end of it the board of transportation has to keep the New York City transit system running 24 hours a day and seven days a week it can't close down at any time consequently the seriousness of the problem and it's the reason why none of the transit systems privately owned systems in this vicinity are yet on a 40 hour week now the Board of Transportation is not opposed to the 40 hour 5 day week for its employees it has proceeded in respect thereto exactly as recommended by the fact finding board last year and as provided for in the memorandum of understanding which was signed by the Board of Transportation and by the several organizations represented by the board of transportation representing its employees on June 27th of last year as was recommended by the transit fact finding board and as was provided for in the memorandum of understanding the board as soon as it could do so made a contract for the employment of industrial engineers to study and report on a program for achieving the five day 40 hour week these engineers were not selected by the board but were selected by the the mayor's committee on management survey headed by Dr. Gulick of Columbia University it was not intended in the memorandum of understanding that the engineers who were to study the 40 hour week should be a different group from those who were employed for the managerial survey as a matter of fact the memorandum of understanding shows clearly that they were to be the same group because after providing an article 3 for retaining industrial engineers to study and report on a program for achieving the 40 hour week article 4 for providing that under the contract by which the industrial engineers referred to in the preceding article will be employed by the board they will be called upon to make a comprehensive managerial study and all the provisions that are in the contract for which they were to be employed under this managerial survey program now it was intended also that these industrial engineers should not immediately upon their being employed sit down to negotiate how we were going to go on a 40 hour week it was intended that they should make an independent study of their own go out on the road and see how things were done and see if they could recommend economies by which we could get the 40 hour week without tremendous expense without ruining the city financially that was their job it was contemplated by the memorandum of understanding that after the report had been made after they had made their report and study that then we should sit down with the unions to work out the program and the schedules before putting it into effect that is shown by this very provision first of all in article 3 it says the board shall retain without delay competent industrial engineers to study and report on a program for achieving the 45 the five day 40 hour week and then states the premises and then it provides that the report of the industrial engineers on the necessary details for the establishment of the 40 hour week shall be made within 10 months after their retention and that the program for achieving the 40 hour week shall be completed as promptly thereafter as possible we were to sit down after the report with the engineers and work out the schedules not have the engineers before they had made any study at all sit down with the union to figure out how we should do it now the memorandum of understanding I may say too with regard to the delay question that we've heard Mr. O'Donnell talk about this contract with the industrial engineers was dated August 7, 1950 first of all the engineers had to be selected by the mayor's committee on managerial survey and they had to work out what their terms of compensation would be and we couldn't make this contract before August 7th that was a month after the agreement was substantially a month after the memorandum of understanding was made then the contract had to be approved by the board of estimate before it could become effective and it wasn't approved by the board of estimate until the 23rd of August now they say we didn't give the engineers orders to proceed until October 4th as it was on October 4th we told the engineers to go out on the properties but during September they had been doing their spade work in the general offices of the board they were paid for September their pay and their work didn't start in October as a matter of fact they couldn't gain very much by going out on the road during August and September because the board granting the three weeks vacation which the fact finding board had recommended which it didn't have to put into effect until the following year put it into effect in that current year and so we had to provide for a third week of vacation for men who had already in that year had two weeks and the road was upset and our normal practices were not enforced so therefore the engineers couldn't make very much of a study on what forces were required until that heavy vacation period was over that's why they didn't go out on the road to make their study until the 4th of October but during the interval they were working in the offices of the board and getting all of the general information that was needed for them to start their study in the field and they were paid for the month of September and it wasn't the employment didn't start wasn't delayed until October the board now 10 months from the date of their retention if we take that date of retention as August 23 when the board of estimate approved the the memorandum of understanding approved the contract with the engineers their 10 month period would be up on June 23 but the board of transportation urged them to finish and submit their report in advance of this date if possible with the result that they submitted it on May 23, 1951 a month ahead of the time specified the board therefore has not delayed but has thought to expedite the study of the 40 hour week with a hope that it could be put into effect without adding too much to operating costs bear in mind moreover that the memorandum of understanding did not contain any definite agreement that the 40 hour week would be established on the contrary it provided that it should not go into effect until the board and the unions both had agreed on the program and that failure to agree on the program should not constitute a grievance let me read that portion of the memorandum of understanding you'll find it in paragraph number 2 of article 3 no program for transition to the 40 hour week shall be made effective without approval of both the board and the union and failure to agree on such a program shall not constitute a grievance either on the part of the board or the unions now the memorandum of understanding after stating that the board should employ these industrial engineers to study and make a report it specified the premises upon which the report should be based which were the same as the terms and conditions on which the fact-finding board had recommended transition to the 40 hour week now among these premises and conditions were the following that in planning the transition it be understood that present earnings exclusive of the general increase recommended above will be maintained or closely approached and that the 11 cent general increase be applied in partial satisfaction of this requirement subdivision c that the employees and their respective unions cooperate in working out and approving revised schedules to enable the board of transportation to make the transition with a minimum of additional cost to be evidenced by their willingness to eliminate unnecessary unproductive paid time and then subdivision e that the necessary planning and rescheduling be done with the assistance and advice of the independent qualified industrial engineers that was after they'd made their report and that it be approved by the employees or by the dominant unions involved in advance of the effective date now after receipt of the report of the industrial engineers the board of transportation met with the officers of the transport workers union and were told by them not only that they flatly rejected the report of the engineers but also that they would not proceed with negotiations for the purpose of working out and agreeing upon new work schedules for the 40 hour week unless the board of transportation would agree in advance to two propositions first that upon transition to the 40 hour week the amount to be paid employees for 40 hours would be the same as the amount now paid for 48 hours including the 11 cents granted last July instead of the amount which was paid for 48 hours prior to that 11 cent increase as provided for in the memorandum of understanding and second that a definite date be fixed for transition to the 40 hour week without waiting for agreement on new work schedules designed to affect economies and reduce the cost of transition the only reason why negotiations with the union for the purpose of agreeing on the planning and rescheduling necessary for transition to the 40 hour week did not proceed at once after receipt of the report of the industrial engineers was that the transport workers union refused to even start such negotiations unless the board of transportation first agreed to these two propositions which were completely at variance with the terms of the memorandum of understanding at that conference the board offered to go to work on the schedule that very afternoon but they wouldn't weren't interested in that they had to have these two propositions agreed to in advance the board took the position and still takes the position that it would be violating its public trust if it did not hold to the terms and conditions agreed to by the unions in the signed memorandum of understanding to pay the same amount for 40 hours as is presently paid for 48 hours would cost more than 11 million dollars per annum in excess of what the cost would be on the basis provided for in the memorandum of understanding as to the proposition that the 40 hour week be made effective before economies and new schedules have been agreed upon this would mean the loss to the city of its one opportunity to save several million dollars in the cost of transition the board of transportation knows from its past experience with the transport workers union that if it made the 40 hour week effective by paying time and a half for all work in excess of 40 hours per week before new schedules had been worked out and agreed upon it would be impossible at a later date to obtain any agreement by the union which would eliminate unproductive paid time or by which the employees would make any contribution whatever toward reducing the cost of the 40 hour week this was recognized by the fact finding board and that is why it recommended as one of the terms and conditions of transition to the 40 hour week quote that the employees and their respective unions cooperate in main in working out and approving revised schedules to enable the board of transportation to make the transition with a minimum of additional cost to be evidenced by their willingness to eliminate unnecessary unproductive paid time but also that the necessary planning and rescheduling be approved by the employees or by the dominant unions in advance of the effective date of transition to the 40 hour week the industrial engineers have recommended several economies all within the limitations of the present working conditions and they estimate that these economies would produce savings of over 10 million dollars per annum many of their recommendations are sound and reasonable and should be acceptable to the employees if they have any idea whatever of cooperating with the board to effect economies the employees incidentally the charge that the industrial engineers have recommended that a large number of men lose their jobs is entirely unfounded and ridiculous in speaking of a reduction in force they were speaking of a reduction in the number of new employees who would have to be hired to effect the 40 hour week they did not advocate a layoff of any of the present employees and the board of transportation is willing to give assurance that no permanent employee will lose his job because of the institution of any economies it is obvious that if the work week is reduced from six days to five days and no economies are instituted which would reduce the necessary number of employees the present force would have to be increased by one-sixth which would mean over 6,000 new employees the engineers indicated that with the economies they recommended this force could be reduced by about 2,000 but it would still be necessary to hire approximately 4,000 new employees to avoid payment of overtime premiums besides the economies recommended by the engineers all of which could be affected without change in the working conditions there are other economies not mentioned by the engineers because they would require change in the working conditions but which employees ought to be willing to go along with in return for a 40 hour week at the present time the so-called fringe benefits enjoyed by employees of the New York City transit system involving payment for unproductive time are far in excess of those enjoyed by employees of other transit systems either in or around New York City or elsewhere among these fringe benefits is the paid lunch period which is a minimum of 30 minutes per day during which the employee leaves his work and is free to go where he pleases but is nevertheless paid for the time nowhere else in this vicinity is a transit employee allowed a paid lunch period in industry generally when reference is made to a 40 hour week consisting of five days of eight hours each the 40 hours and the eight hours mean actual working time and do not include the period during which an employee is allowed to leave his work and go to lunch it is erroneous to say that the operating employees on the New York City transit system are on a 48 hour week today because of the 48 hours at least three hours constitute time during which the employee is released from work for the purpose of eating his lunch the employees are being paid for 48 hours but actually their work week if computed on the way a work week is generally computed does not exceed 45 hours if the Board of Transportation continues to pay for a half hour lunch period upon transition to a so-called 40 hour week the employees will be on a 37 and a half hour week not a 40 hour week reference has been made to the fact that a bus driver operating a bus on First Avenue in New York a city owned line presently receives only a dollar fifty-five an hour while a man operating a bus on Lexington Avenue one of the lines of the New York City omnibus corporation receives a dollar sixty-seven and a half cents an hour however if in each case the operator finishes his work eight and a half hours after he commences and in each case has a half an hour for lunch the operator on the city's line would receive eight and a half hours pay for the day while the operator on the line of the private company would receive only eight hours pay for the day the result is that their day's pay is practically the same only a few cents difference besides the paid lunch period there are other differences between working conditions and run schedules on the New York City transit system and those on other transit systems which mean greater payments for unproductive time on the city owned system than on any others evidence of this was presented to the fact-finding board last year also evidence was presented as to the unwillingness of the union to accept any changes in schedules by which employees would do any more work within an eight-hour day than they had done in the past there are some runs which finish in less than six hours from the time they commence and included in this six hours is the paid lunch period as well as idle time between trips known as relay time although the employee goes home less than six hours from the time he reports for work he nevertheless receives eight hours pay there are a great many runs which are completed in less than seven hours but for which the employee receives eight hours pay the union however has always fought against any attempt to lengthen short runs by adding extra trips or by adding any extra running time at all its aim has always been to give less and less in the way of work but get more and more in the way of compensation it is obvious that the transition to a five-day 40-hour week must be a give and take arrangements but the Board of Transportation knows from past experience that it will be all take by the union and no give unless new schedules which will eliminate or at least reduce unproductive paid time and which will call for a reasonably full day's work for a full day's pay are worked out and agreed upon before the 40-hour week goes into effect the Board owes the solemn duty to the public to keep down operating costs as far as is reasonably possible and it does not feel that it has any right to waive or disregard the provisions of the memorandum of understanding which it signed with the Transport Workers Union and the other unions representing its employees when to do so would place a tremendous additional financial burden on the city the industrial engineers estimate that to go to a 40-hour week on the basis of paying the same amount for 40 hours as is currently paid for 48 hours without deduction of the 11-cent increase granted last July and they made a careful study of this too and I'll bring them before your committee anytime you care to have them to grant to give it the same amount for 40 hours it is now paid for 48 hours including the 11 cents and without affecting any economies or eliminating any unproductive paid time would increase payroll costs above those of the current fiscal year by $23,805,000 this however is after we have hired all of the additional employees necessary to avoid overtime it is on the assumption that over 6,000 employees will immediately be hired and put to work to avoid overtime but it will take a long time to find and train such a large number of new employees and in the meantime the present employees would have to be paid at the rate of time and one half for performing as overtime work the work which would be done at straight time by the new employees this means that at least during the first year of the 40 hour week payroll costs would be almost 50% higher than the $23,805,000 or close on the $36 million the seriousness of this is made apparent when we consider the fact that even in the current fiscal year the New York City transit system will have an operating deficit of about $2 million if the 11 cent is not deducted and if no economies are affected the operating deficit in the first year of the 40 hour week would be nearly $38 million even if transfers between surface lines and rapid transit lines were eliminated and a straight fare of 10 cents charged on each this would reduce the deficit only by about $8 million and it would still be nearly $30 million on the other hand the engineers estimate that if the 11 cents is deducted as the unions agreed it should be and if the economies the engineers suggest or some other economies are put into effect no their estimate is based on their own economies if the economies of the engineers are put into effect their estimate is that the additional cost of the 40 hour week for the first year even making allowance for necessary overtime would be brought down to about $6,514,000 that is the difference between getting the economies and deducting the 11 cents and giving them the 11 cents the whole business that they're getting now and no economies at all the difference between $6.5 million increase in cost or for the first year nearly $36 million dollars what then in the light of what I have said could the engineers could the board of transportation do when Mr. Quill and his associates absolutely refuse to negotiate with regard to economies and new schedules unless at the outset the board agreed to make the 40 hour week effective before these negotiations were completed and unless the board of transportation also agreed not to deduct the 11 cents but to pay for 40 hours what is now paid for 48 hours with the 11 cents included the board simply could not agree to these propositions without violating its duty to the public consequently the union walked out and we have this impasse the board of transportation has been ready and is ready now to sit down with the several unions to agree on the economies to be affected and to work out and agree upon new schedules to do so and to do so with all possible speed it even offered the very first day that we sat down with the transport workers union to go to work on the schedules that afternoon but they declined the offer the answer is that they are trying to avoid any economies at all and that's why we can't afford to put this into effect until we have an agreement on those economies the board as I say has been ready and is ready now to sit down with the several unions and to work out and agree on new schedules and to do so with all possible speed but it will not take responsibility for departing from the terms and conditions on which the fact-finding board recommended transition to a 40-hour week and to which the unions solemnly agreed in writing when they signed the memorandum of understanding the board believes that the several unions should stick to their agreement and not treat it as a mere scrap of paper the board has instructed me to say that they will be glad to have you gentlemen decide whether it is right or wrong in the position it has taken it welcomes your assistance in solving the problem which has been presented Thank you Mr. Warner Mr. Chairman, just a minute sir, there were two points raised here to be the government I'd like very brief to commence one in three, a half hour statement and the other in question of our automatic Is this in rebuttal to Mr. Warner? No No You submit that in your brief Mr. No Thank you We have here a request to hear from the New York City Transit Police Sergeants Association and also the Supervisory Employers Association we would request those two organizations to submit briefs which would be very glad to go over we can't continue on here Mr. Chairman I have my briefs there, may I submit them now? Yes You can submit the copy of the group Six? Yeah, we got a member of Random Hair Fella about that The committee asked that all organizations desirous of filing written briefs in support of their positions submit not less than six copies to the committee not later than June the 22nd, 1951 So, Paul, we call this little meeting to a close and the committee, mayor's committee will go into an executive session Thank you, everybody, for coming You have been listening to these hearings presided over by the mayor's three-man mediation board on the transit system question We heard several witnesses from the labor side and a member of the board of transportation's legal counsel The first witness this afternoon was George Matthews, president of Local 380 of the AFL Municipal Transit Workers He spoke of the fact that there is a loss in the operation of the ferry system He is in favor of the 48 hours pay for a 40-hour work week He said that other cities have this in effect Mr. Matthews also told of the 10% increase for unskilled workers and the increase of the cost of livings And he quoted the Memorandum of Understanding as favoring this If engineers had not studied the problem of the 40-hour week He said it would already have been in effect He recommended that prevailing rates be given all mechanics And he accused the Board of Transportation of using subterfuges to avoid this He said that skilled mechanics of various types are wrongly titled And consequently they get less money Mr. Matthews maintained that because of this many workers leave their jobs for private industry He said that all the facts already are in as far as the previous reports are concerned That was the testimony in summary of George Matthews of the AFL Local 380 of the transit workers Next witness was Frank Nolan, the general chairman of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen and Towermen Lodge 113 of the AFL He endorsed the representation made this morning And he left the matter in the hands of the mediation board And we heard from Robert W. Brady, the president of the Civil Service Forum of New York City His organization advocates peaceful and equitable relationships between the Board of Transportation and Labor He questions the legality of the checkoff system and the increased vacation and pay Since the memorandum was not submitted to his organization He also advocates the reduced work week without a reduction in pay And said that the short work week has been universally adopted and should apply to transit workers without a reduction in compensation If necessary, additional help should be employed according to the president of the Civil Service Forum He maintained that services should be kept up and he cited the president's emergency board granting increases to the railway express workers and other evidence The Civil Service Forum, according to its president, contends that qualified and justly satisfied personnel must be granted so that Pardon, the Civil Service Forum contends that justly satisfied laborers must be used Private industry is always in the fore of granting equitable demands to workers And he said that the debt of a city government should not deprive public workers of proper wages The Civil Service Forum then supported recommendations of the next speaker who was Robert E. Kirkpatrick The transit chairman of the Civil Service Forum He recommended the 40-hour week without a reduction in pay A 10% increase in wages And he said that the Board of Transportation can grant a 5-day 40-hour week without delay for most departments He also recommended time and a half for overtime And said that his organization will cooperate with the Board of Transport He also urges discontinuance of any more swing tricks Mr. Joseph A. McCarthy of Local 624 The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Workers of the AFL was next He spoke on behalf of supervisory employees suggesting that the union be given a hearing to clear up inequities of salary among these people I have predominantly cultural participants He tried to collect UC trasment and the electric industry He tried to collect wildlife mutual impacts
