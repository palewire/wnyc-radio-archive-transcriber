Cardinal Spellman will give the invocation and benediction. And now, to begin our program, we turn our microphone over to Commissioner of Hospitals, Dr. Marcus D. Kogel. Please rise for the national anthem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor, Mr. Emanence, Mr. Coyne, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you. This afternoon, we are privileged to have a Prince of the Church with us at the dedication of a Cathedral of Healing. And with the psalmists we say, except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it. It has been said that in no activity does man approach nearer to God than when he ministers to his fellow man. It is in that spirit that the James Ewing Hospital is being dedicated today. And it is in that spirit of dedication that I am privileged to call upon his eminence Francis Cardinal Spellman to pronounce the invocation. Cardinal Spellman. Life-giving Father in heaven, whose breath is life to man's body, whose spirit is health to man's soul, and whose spirit is health to man's body. Bless, we, this house of healing, this temple of mercy and laboratory of discovery, New York City's new haven for the helpless. Gain to seal the James Ewing Hospital as a home where thy glory dwellest. Thou who gloriest in mercy deeds. Curing the afflicted and destroying dread diseases Keep thy merciful presence abiding within its walls Quickening with divine and human hope and health Those that enter here for care and cure Bless those that labor here in this hospital With thee and for thee in thy workshop of mercy For thine is the light finding dark causes Thine is the love supporting great labors Thine is the life renewing doomed bodies Thine is the hope girding worn spirits Thine is the glory conquering disease O eternal God, designer of nature's mysteries It is thou who preparest thoughts in men's minds Unlocking to them the secrets of the universe Unloosing for them the forces of life Revealing to them the laws of health Inspiring scientists to wondrous discoveries Performing through them thy ministry of healing We pray thee, God of mercy and of science That this house of healing ever may be a saving sanctuary A lighthouse casting beams of blessings abroad Glorifying thee with miracles of resurrection Lightening hearts with comfort and hope On this dedicatory day of this, thy new temple Devoutly we thank thee, Lord of life and of love Humbly we beg thee, great master of science Teach us to use knowledge to cure and to save Helping to build a better world for tomorrow For a man's happier, healthier life and for peace This is thy will, O God of mercy and science Thy holy will, that we pray May be done on earth as it is in heaven For a man's earthly welfare And for a man's eternal salvation Amen We are met here this afternoon To dedicate the James Ewing Hospital Devoted to the treatment of and research in neoplastic diseases This meeting is a real historic occasion for our city How urgently this hospital is needed Is evident from the fact That as our population increases in age The incidence of cancer also rises Nor is cancer limited to those in the afternoon of life It strikes the helpless infant The adolescent child And men and women in their most promising and productive periods It casts its malignant shadow upon every home In New York City alone The disease has increased from a mortality rate of 136 per 100,000 During the decade between 1930 and 1939 To 185.8 Approximately 186 per 100,000 in 1949 Presenting a challenge Which calls for the massing of all the knowledge The skills and techniques that science is possessed of Plus all the humaneness And the love of mankind That can be encompassed Within the spirit of civilized humanity And it is this great harmony of skills and attitudes That we shall find here At the James Ewing Hospital This hospital which we are dedicating today And the Francis Delafield Hospital Which will be dedicated later this month Are partial answers to the challenge Of the second greatest cause of death In the city of New York Moreover They are an earnest indication Of the cooperation that exists in our city Between the municipal and the voluntary hospital system And with all the medical colleges And they are the answer To those who preach that there can never be A real report between government and voluntary effort Here we have a formula In the best democratic traditions Government and voluntary effort United by mutual trust In an all-out offensive Against the greatest of all of man's enemies Sympathy for the sick And an understanding of their problems Are a measure of the greatness of a man He to whom the woes of his fellow man appeal And more than that He who understands their problem Is by these standards a great man But even a greater man is he Whose sympathy and understanding Go beyond emotions And resolve themselves into practical effort For the alleviation of these woes And the resolution of these problems By these standards No man is greater in our city Than its chief executive The Honorable William O'Dwyer I come now to what is to me And I am sure to all A sad note in these ceremonies To say farewell to our mayor The city's thousands of sick Will miss his kind understanding His zeal To

Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Coombe. Coordinating all of these activities that have brought to fruition this physical plant has been the Department of Public Works of the City of New York, whose Commissioner, the Honorable Frederick H. Zemulin, it is now my privilege to introduce to you. Commissioner Zemulin. Thank you. Your Eminence, Dr. Coombe, distinguished guests and ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Much more than a formal dedication of a hospital is involved in this ceremony today. For this beautiful modern structure, filled with the promise of new future cures and relief for the suffering, is concrete and steel evidence that we are well on our way with the largest hospital construction program in the world to give to the people of the city of New York the very finest possible medical care. It was only relatively a short time ago that Mayor O'Dwyer and his administration were faced with the problem of providing long overdue hospital facilities for this city. We not only needed new hospitals, but our existing hospitals, most of them more than 50 years old, are badly in need of modernization and repairs. The war and a subsequent shortage of materials and labor, high construction costs, the city's limited financial, limited finances, and the fact that the overlong deferred public improvements also were needed to meet the city's school, housing, health, and other requirements didn't make the job any easier. To his everlasting credit, Mayor O'Dwyer faced the problem squarely and promptly. Soon after assuming office, he set in motion this $42 million hospital construction program that could be undertaken immediately. It soon became apparent that the construction needs of the city would require much more than the sorely pressed capital budget and debt limit could sustain. Mayor O'Dwyer sponsored the legislation by which you people last year were able to approve a $150 million bond issue outside the city debt limit to be used solely for hospital construction. As Commissioner of the Department of Public Works, which is charged with the design and construction of hospitals, I am proud to report to you people that the entire program is well underway. Our latest report for the first six months of this year shows that four structures already have been completed at a construction cost of $17.5 million. And that we have under construction at this time, five hospitals to cost an additional $53 million to give us a construction program thus far this year of over $70 million. We also have underway a hospital design program calling for $127 million of hospital construction. Another $10 million will be used over a five-year period for the modernization and rehabilitation of some of our existing hospitals. The mayor and his administration may be well proud of this program. The mayor may be well proud of it as a personal achievement. Since his announcement that he would accept another post in the service of his country, many have been eloquent in their tribute to his record. At this time, I should like to add my own tribute and sincere thanks to the mayor for his cooperation and guidance, which have enabled my department during his administration to break every production record in the history of the department. But no words at my command can match the last tribute contained in the building that we dedicate here today. Speeches are soon forgotten, but on what I hope will be frequent visits of the mayor to his hometown, he will see public improvements such as this hospital as a living testimonial and a more eloquent tribute than I could voice to him today. I should like also to point out at this time that none of this hospital program would have been possible without the forward thinking and planning of our most able hospital commissioner, Dr. Colbert, and his predecessor, Dr. Bernicke, and his entire medical staff. Also to the members of the board of Estonia, who may well share the triumph at this moment, as evidence that they have served their city well. Now let me tell you a little about this structure. This impressive appearance is in complete harmony with the other buildings in this medical group covering the entire square block. Structurally, its hidden strength and quality equals its outer appearance. The entire building is founded on rock, and the frame is of structural steel with floor slabs of reinforced concrete. Its exterior walls of brick rise above a granite base and a slate facing to the second floor. The 12-story building with two basements has a gross volume of 2.5 million cubic feet equal to nearly 5,000 single-family houses, and its cost is $5,600,000. The site, as you have been told, was provided by the Memorial Hospital. It occupies the entire west end of the block of the Sloan-Kittering Institute. This 275-bed cancer hospital was designed by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owens, and Merrill under the direction of my department. In direct charge of the work was the director of the Bureau of Buildings, appointed Jay Fowler, assisted by Albert Fowler, architect for hospitals on design, and William Barry, chief of the construction. The plans were started way back in February of 1946 and were completed in 10 months. Excavation was started in January 1947, and today you see the completed structure which embraces the latest developments for the medical and physical well-being of patients. Important, it will double the present cancer facilities of the Department of Hospitals. Now, as a practicing engineer and architect, I want to thank all the employees of my department whose skill and toil went into the making of this public improvement. They may well share the pride, the plaudits, and the gratitude that accompany the completion of any large construction job well done. And now, Dr. Kogel, it is my privilege as a commissioner of the Department of Public Works to officially turn over to you this fully completed hospital ready for service. Thank you very much, Commissioner Mullen. I'm very happy to accept this magnificent structure. Dr. Kogel, the influence of a great teacher upon his disciples is a chain reaction of goodness. Not alone are they affected by it, but they in turn radiate the knowledge and skills which they have acquired to their own disciples. Dr. Lesperance was closely associated with Dr. Ewing for many years as an associate and as a student. It is a pleasure for me to call upon her to tell us something about Dr. Ewing, the great teacher, but greater still the kindly human being who is so intensely and personally interested in the welfare of all of his patients. Dr. Ewing, the director of the Cape DePewstrang Cancer Prevention Clinic. Dr. Lesperance. Members and friends, the completion of this magnificent institution is a fitting tribute to the memory of a great man in the field of cancer. Dr. Ewing, the director of the United States. It does not fully indicate the far-reaching effect the dynamic personality of this simple, dignified man had on medical men and women who were fortunate enough to come under his influence. Dr. Ewing, his untiring energy and enthusiasm, his desire for perfection, his vision of the great future in the study of cancer made him one of the most inspiring figures in medicine during the past 50 years. Dr. Ewing, the great man is entitled to have his shadow. And I enjoyed that rare privilege of this close association from 1910 until his death in 1943, with one of the most brilliant yet human individuals I have ever known, Dr. James Ewing. Dr. Ewing, those were the years of his greatest activity as professor of pathology at Cornell University Medical College, writing his masterpiece, Neoplastic Diseases, planning the future of a great cancer center, which would develop through expansion of the activities of the small hospital on 160. Dr. Ewing, those were the years of the small hospital on 160. Anyone who attended the conferences there during this time felt the vast power and vision which Ewing brought to the cancer problem. Dr. Ewing, his energy and capacity for concentrated mental work were boundless. He felt that a task once undertaken must, if humanly possible, be finished. He wrote me one summer, Dr. Ewing, his energy and capacity for the cancer center. I spend my mornings at memorials where cancer runs its uninterrupted course in large numbers. At night, I take approval meals and read or write on my book till nearly midnight. I admit it grows tiredly, but I am going to keep it up until this book is finished or finishes me. Dr. Ewing, few who read this standard work on neoplastic disease, realize that every detail of this book was done by Ewing himself. His aim was to gather together in one volume a short but complete study of neoplastic disease. Dr. Ewing, few used for an extraordinary climbing peace, holidayulation and a short Story of the Self, the Socialist Schuerdi book. His loyalty to his friends was remarkable, for once you were a friend of Ewing's, he accepted that friendship as an obligation to minimize your failings and emphasize your good qualities. He was prodigal of his time to those who paid for information or help in any or all problems. I have seen him spend an entire afternoon with a troubled student or an anxious patient. There was very little in Ewing of the austerity considered requisite in the public picture of a scientist, for he thoroughly enjoyed in frequent relaxation such as swimming, tennis, motoring, and a stimulating game of bridge. In all of these pastimes, he excelled. Today, we see one of his dreams realized, the establishment of a hospital for the prevention and treatment of cancer, a complete research institute, and now a hospital for chronic cancer cases. It is unfortunate that he could not see this dream come true, but we who were closely associated with him know that his was the vision and his was the faith that laid the foundation of this world-famous cancer center. This beautiful building is a tribute to his greatness as a scientist and a physician, but the tribute that can never be destroyed is carried in the heart of those who knew him as a man of vision, integrity, and courage, whose kindness and loyalty were priceless possessions to those who were privileged to know him as a friend. Your city station has been bringing you the dedication ceremony of the James Ewing Hospital for cancer located at First Avenue between 67th and 68th Street. Guest speakers have included Marcus D.
