In behalf of the faculty, I want to express to you our greatest appreciation for the possibility of us coming here today and setting the cornerstone for our new building. Some members of the faculty and those of the printing industry who have been waiting for this occasion, which we consider the most outstanding one of its kind in the history of our school. We've been waiting for this to happen for more than a quarter century, and we are glad that you are with us to share our pleasures at this time. As principal of the school, it is my privilege to present to you the man who will preside at these ceremonies. It is my privilege to present to you the President of the Board of Education, the Honorable Charles H. Silver. Commissioner of the Board of Education, the Honorable Charles H. Silver. Mayor Wagner, President Stark, Mrs. Fiske, Mrs. Donnelly, Mr. Friedman and members of the Graphic Arts Commission, my colleagues on the Board of Education, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen and students of the New York School of Printing. Thank you, Mr. Tegel. We are indebted to you as principal of the New York School of Printing and as a man who has spent more than 25 years on the faculty of this school for helping to bring about a splendid arrangement for today's ceremony. I know that I speak for all of us in congratulating you on the impressive sight of your students marching in with their pressman's caps and signs. The sentiments on those signs are certainly ones with which we all agree. I will be proud to be proud of you. I want to thank also the Caristo Construction Corporation for the great efforts they put forth to have the area made ready for these ceremonies. This is a notable day not alone because of the purpose for which we have gathered, but also because it is the birthday of Benjamin Franklin, master printer and publisher. He was born on January 17, 1706 and he lives today in the heart of every American. On this historic anniversary, on this plot of land, we will lift a structure unique and apart from any other academy in North world. It will be a bold and dramatic milestone in functional beauty, a model and high standard for every other community in America. Today, the teaching of printing, New York City's second largest manufacturer industry will be centered in a school of its own, a $7 million structure that will be, without a doubt, the finest school of its kind in the world. and the finest school of its own, a saint. and the finest school of the world. and the finest school of the world. and the finest school of the world. On the ever-widening borders of education, your school will be an outpost of youth adventuring into the black magic of applying ink to paper to reveal the printed word to the multitudes of the earth. Soaring in stone and steel, it will stand as your city's proud answer to one of our nation's greatest educative needs. But it will be so much more than stone and steel. These things do not really make a school. It will live and breathe. It will pulse with the spirit and energy of the students who will learn within its walls and the instructors who will teach in its lecture halls, shops, and press rooms. It is not too difficult to erect a building. Mankind has known the art for centuries. Our aim is to keep alive in this citadel of learning, the living, breeding inspiration it inherits from Benjamin Franklin, who was setting type as an apprentice printer at the age of 12, who published Paul Richard's Almanac and founded the Saturday Evening Post. He loved the art and craft of printing all his life, and even at the age of 82 was writing to Noah Webster concerning some improvement in printing. We may truly say that the letter F in Freedom of the Press might well stand for the name of Franklin. I am honored to convey to you the greetings of your entire Board of Education on this happy occasion. For the past several years, as President of the Board, I've had the pleasure personally of dealing with the men within the school system and also within industry and labor who have given life to this great project. I have never met a more determined, unselfish, and devoted group. They have given us courage, advice, and practical aid. They have been generous with ideas, arguments, delegations, equipment, and reports. Indeed, they have shown me everything except indifference in their determined effort to get this school going and to bring it from the plan board and the blueprint to this great day. This school is part of the unique educational program under which we are providing specialized schools for specific major industries. Here in New York, we do not believe in part-time or half-baked training. The requirements of New York industry and the standards of New York labor are so high that none but the best can qualify. We of the Board of Education know that we must provide the highest possible level of instruction, and that is exactly what this school and schools like this will offer. And let it be said here and now that the efforts of all these men and the many hands and hearts that labor to make this school possible would have been in vain without the aid and encouragement of our mayor. It could not have been constructed at this time were it not for his enthusiasm and interest. The mainspring in our mammoth school building program, a dynamic leader who gets things done, is our mayor, Bob Wagner. Working shoulder to shoulder with him in a close and enthusiastic relationship, the employing printers, the labor unions in the printing arts and crafts, the dedicated faculty of the New York School of Printing, and the members of your Board of Education have all labored for the consummation of this cornerstone lane. They may well take pride in the fruit of their efforts, and proudest of all, I am sure, is the beloved principal of your school, Freddie Tangle. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
