And now, the Honorable Vincent Impelletieri, Mayor of New York. Ladies and gentlemen, this afternoon I'm pleased to be permitted to come before you to report to the people of the city on a threatened bus strike. And in order to fully advise the people of my city as to the issues involved and the plans we make to take care of this situation, I have asked the members of my Transit Advisory Commission, Daniel Cornbloom, the Director of the Division of Labor Relations of the City of New York, Judge Edward McGuire, Chairman of the Transit Advisory Commission, and Dennis Hurley, the Corporation Counsel of the City of New York, to appear on this program with me. Every one of us in this city realizes now, and has realized for a long time, the serious problem that would confront the people of the city of New York in connection with a bus strike. As a matter of fact, more than a year ago, to be exact, in December of 1951, I advocated before the Board of Estimate the creation of a Transit Advisory Commission. What happened to that? That suggestion was turned down. I kept pressing for the creation of this commission, and finally, in August of 1952, the Transit Advisory Commission was authorized, and it finally got down to work in October of 1952. because the commission's knowledge of the fact that the private bus situation was most pressing. It has been devoting all of its energies in studying that situation. Now, what are we faced with today? We have two main problems. Number one, the threat of a bus strike, and number two, the problem of how the cost of a reasonable settlement of the disputes between the private bus companies and the union may be met. It is a very simple thing to say. I've heard it so many times that just increase the fares, and everybody will be happy. Everybody but the 8 million people of the city of New York who have to bear the burden of an increased fare. It has consistently been my position. If there is any other way of financing a reasonable settlement, it should be resorted to, it must be resorted to, before the tremendous burden of an increased fare is passed on to the people of the city of New York. Let me reiterate. I am still opposed to an increase in the fare on the private bus lines of the city of New York. What have we done? And what are we trying to do? To work out a reasonable settlement of the dispute between the union and the companies, and to seek a means of financing a reasonable settlement. Commissioner Kornblum, in addition to being a member of the Transit Advisory Commission, you are the Director of Labor Relations of the City of New York. Will you tell the people of the City of New York, Dan, just what the present situation is? Well, Your Honor, as to the labor controversy, the public has the unfortunate impression that the only issue in this dispute is the 40-hour week, and that it is unfair to withhold it from the private transit employees any longer. This is a mistaken impression. It should be corrected. The issue is not so much whether there shall be a five-day week. Rather, it is whether an extravagant price shall be paid for it, or shall it be instituted on reasonable terms at a cost which is not prohibited. It happens that the highest hourly rate for bus operators in the entire country is $1.91 an hour, and it is being paid by a company right here in New York City, the Green Bus Lines. As Your Honor well knows, because of your constructive part in bringing this about, That company is now on a 40-hour week and is successfully paying the $1.91 rate without increasing the basic $0.10 fare. Now, in this dispute, the union is asking for the 40-hour week at a price of $0.34 to $0.51 an hour higher than the highest rate in the whole country. This means hourly rates for bus drivers are from $2.25 to $2.51 an hour. Such a price for a 40-hour week couldn't be met even by a $0.15 fare. As a matter of fact, at least three of the eight companies don't wish a $0.15 fare because of their knowledge of what it would do and what it would mean in loss of passengers and ultimate loss of revenue. Now, on the other hand, in this dispute, the companies simply sit back, making no counteroffers, waiting for the riding public to pick up the tab. We're working on this dispute right now. We shall never give up. Your mediation committee is in City Hall with some of the bus companies on the union right now, and I've just come away from that meeting. Judge McGuire, the Transit Advisory Commission has been studying the financial condition of the companies and the proposed costs of various settlements. Is that right? Yes, Mr. Mayor. Judge, will you tell us something about that situation? Well, we know the financial status of each company. The largest, the Third Avenue, has already been given relief from the city that runs into millions by reason of the elimination of a combination ride and the reduction to one-half of one percent of the franchise payments. There are no further concessions which the city could make to enable this company to survive, even if it secured a reasonable settlement with the union. There is another company which, despite all the city might try to do for it, would probably not survive the added cost of a reasonable settlement. There is one way, however, that all companies can be permitted to survive, and that is by the elimination of the New York state and city taxes and at least part of the franchise payments. The private bus operators in New York City pay to the state annually in excess of $3 million. They pay to the city in taxes $844,000 and to the city by way of franchise payments $2,256,000. That sum should be more than enough to permit payment of the cost of a reasonable settlement and further to allow the companies to live at the present rate of fare. Mr. Mayor, if the fare increase of 15 cents was put into effect, that would bring to every one of the riders of these private bus lines, and I understand there are $3,500,000 a day, an additional cost of 10 cents per day, 50 cents per week, or $26 a year. This is an absolute bedrock minimum, and the probabilities are that it would far exceed $26 per rider. On the other hand, if all of the state and city taxes and franchise payments were eliminated, the cost to each person in the city of New York would be 52 cents per year, and the 10-cent fare would be preserved. That is why the Transit Advisory Committee has recommended to you and the Board of Estimates the retention of the 10-cent fare and the enactment of laws which will eliminate these city and state taxes on essential bus service. Mr. Corporation Counsel, your office and you personally has under study in the Corporation Counsel's office the question of state and city elimination of certain taxes, and also the question of the omnibus redevelopment corporation plan, and I'd like to read to you just for a moment from a telegram I received from Governor Dewey last night, and this telegram in part reads as follows. You speak of tax reduction for the city bus companies. As lawyers, you and your associates must know that the regular state taxes imposed upon them are the same as are paid by all bus companies in the 62 cities and counties of the state. Even if constitutional, any such special subsidy would be unsound and discriminatory. would you tell me what you have to say about this observation of the governor? Mr. Mayor, with all due respect to Governor Dewey, I believe that his excellency labors under a false assumption. As your corporation counsel, you know that I have too much pride in the law department of the city of New York to draft unsound or unconstitutional legislation. The law setting up the Omnibus Development Corporation, which we propose granting tax exemption, would affect not only the private bus companies in the city of New York, but would apply with equal force to all bus companies throughout the 62 counties and cities and cities in the state. Our legislation is not, therefore, unsound or discriminatory. Furthermore, Mr. Mayor, let me make this point perfectly clear. The law that we propose is actually the same kind of a law that was passed for the residents of Long Island. The Long Island Railroad Act and the Long Island Transit Authority Act passed by the New York State Legislature in 1952 and signed by Governor Dewey. Under such acts, tax exemption is granted. The Long Island Railroad taking away $3 million in taxes from the city of New York under this Long Island Authority plan for the benefit of Long Island residents, 80% of whom are from the counties of Nassau and Suffolk. Judge McGuire? Mr. Mayor, here's something interesting. There's no question in my mind that every community in the state would agree to have such a bill passed. For example, in Utica, the Utica Transit Corporation, which charges a 15 cent fare, showed a deficit for the nine months ending September the 30th. Rochester, which also charges a 15 cent fare, showed a deficit for the same period of approximately $116,000. That is a condition that generally exists throughout the state. And that is why Governor Dewey's own chairman of the State Public Service Commission said in a speech, and I'm quoting Chairman Feinberg, as I have pointed out, taxes constitute an important segment of operating costs of bus companies. The mounting burden of these levies often means a difference between operating in the red or in the black. For companies that are able to earn some return the reduction, if not the entire elimination of some of these taxes would make possible low affairs. ladies and gentlemen, I've merely given you a thumbnail sketch of the present transit situation. I'll be back to report to you later on, I hope, this week. Thank you very much. connaiss해� fearsome and somewhat behind the Present urban h T
