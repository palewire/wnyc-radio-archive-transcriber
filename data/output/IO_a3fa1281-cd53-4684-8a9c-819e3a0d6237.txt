The End Two little girls in blue, lads, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lads, who won your father's home. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted above. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow's last is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I too. Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come. Ever since we were boys, sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Come, come, come, come. Come, come, come, come. Come, come, come. Come, come, come. Come, come. Come, come. Come, come. Come, come.
