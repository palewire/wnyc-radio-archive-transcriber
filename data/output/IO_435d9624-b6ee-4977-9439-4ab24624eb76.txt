Everybody seems happy and bright like the day itself, and well, it's a great day for the Irish and it's a great day for history, because when the little people emerge, there's nothing to worry about. In a few moments, you'll hear the brilliant voices of the Police Glee Club, raised in song here in the Council Chamber in City Hall, and Mr. Whelan is about ready now to inform the Mayor that he has brought another distinguished guest to this great and wonderful building, City Hall. Mr. Whelan. Will you please be in order? The Police Glee Club will open the proceedings with the national anthem. I'll sing you a song, a soldier's song, with chilly rousing chorus, as round our blazing miles we throng, the starry heavens all of us, impatient for the coming fight, while we await the morning's light, till in the silence of the night, we'll chant the soldier's song. So, soldiers are we, whose lives are played to Ireland, some have come from a land beyond the way, sworn to be free. No more, our ancient silence shall shelter the despot or the slave. Tonight we man the barn of will, in Ireland's cause of all the will, mid cannons' roar and rifles' fill, we'll chant the soldier's song. Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hail, at the twilight's At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight All the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air They proved through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled Hanna yet wave O'er the lands of the free And the home of the brave And now, Mr. Whalen will make the introductions. The mayor of the city of New York Is receiving the foreign minister of the Irish Republic, The Honorable Seen McBride. Mr. Whalen. Mayor O'Dwyer, it's a great privilege and honor For me to present to you The Minister of Foreign Affairs Of the Republic of Ireland, Sean McBride. Mr. Whalen, Our distinguished visitor, Ladies and gentlemen who have come here To take part in this official welcome To the Minister for Foreign Affairs Of the Republic of Erie. Grover, as I see it, I regret to say that There is not a Republic of Ireland yet. As a Republic of Erie, Ireland was built by God As one full completed plot, Foreign domination has split a corner away, And it still dominates it, And until we get them out of there, We won't have a Republic of Ireland, But we'll get it someday. Thank you. Thank you. In this room, Ladies and gentlemen who are here, And those who are listening in, I, as Mayor of the City, Have had the honor To welcome Many Great men And on occasion Women too From overseas, From other parts Of our hemisphere. In every occasion, There were persons Who had distinguished themselves In the fight For the freedom Of people. On each and every occasion, There represented groups Within Their homeland That joined with them To the Jaws of death To procure And to preserve Human liberty. In no occasion Until today, Except once, Did I have the privilege Of welcoming The representative Of a people Who have Kept up Without exception Of one year Over 700 years Of continuous Fight For liberty At home And almost As many years In the fight For the liberty Of peoples Throughout the world. Speaking as an American Today, I will be forgiven By freedom-loving Peoples everywhere. If I have A great pride In the history Of my people In the fight For freedom And that I have That pride An opportunity To express that pride Here today In bidding welcome To a youngster Who already Has served Not only Liberty In his homeland But liberty In foreign lands Who has Come From a bloodstream On his mother's side And on his father's side Where there was No limit To the distance They went In procuring liberty At home And elsewhere.

Come back to where in the morning, the morning. Come back again to the land of my birth. Come back to where in the morning, the morning. And his dear army shall ring with the birth. Come back again to the night of my birth. For the cause we fought for a dime. And the time will soon be when you'll see the line at free. It's the land of our love and pride. We despise and defy our oppressors. And the tyrant laws we will fight. Tonight, but as fast as we can make them, Big government we must break them. Surely Irish have a great day tonight. Surely Irish have a great day tonight. Oh, I woke me up this morning and I heard a joyful song. From the throats of happy Irishmen, a hundred thousand strong. Sure it was the Liberian Brigade, Liding up for the start of the big parade. So I fetched me Sunday fun and a flag I love so well. And I bought myself a shamrock just to wear it my lapel. Don't you know that today, March 17, Is the day for the wearing of the green. It's a great day for the Irish. It's a great day for them. The cyborgs of New York are think with bloody. And sure you think the York was old bloody. It's a great day for the shamrock. And the flags in full array. When the Irish are in full array. It's a great, great day. And Irish are in full array. It's a great, great day. Now, Mr. Whelan. Sergeant and gentlemen of the Police Glee Club, from the approval of the Commander-in-Chief of the Police Department of the great city of New York, I'm sure there will be no transfers of the Glee Club to City Island today. Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you'll remain seated while the Minister of External Affairs and his Honour, the Mayor, leaves the room. In a wonderful spirit of appropriate camaraderie, the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Ireland, Sean McBride, has been received here today by our own Irishman, William O'Dwyer, born in the ancient land of Ireland that needs apologised to no nation for its cultural values or the struggle it has carried on through the centuries for the enthronement of liberty, life, and the pursuit of happiness. And now, smiling happily, benignly happy, the Honourable William O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York, escorts his Irish guests down the aisle of the Council Chamber of City Hall and to the splendid and wonderful music of the Police Glee Club. We've had epitomised here for us today in music the feelings that every New Yorker has had for this great and wonderful day. The Republic of Ireland, just being internationally acknowledged since, as of Easter Sunday, just a few weeks back, finds a quick reflection here in the history of the world in this reception at City Hall. And so it has been in the past and will be in the future. New York City loves to acknowledge accomplishment, especially that that concerns itself with the liberty of all people and the freedom and happiness to pursue life as we see fit for the good of all, for the glorification of all, in the name of God and all the intentions of the spiritual aspects of life itself. And so, from City Hall, we conclude the reception to the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Ireland, the Honourable Shane McBride. And now the mayor is conducting his guests down to the steps at City Hall, and we'll adjourn now to the City Hall steps, although I believe this concludes the radio broadcast part of the ceremony. We return you now to the studios. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
