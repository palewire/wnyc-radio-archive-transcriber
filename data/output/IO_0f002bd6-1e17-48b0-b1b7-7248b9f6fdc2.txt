Pray somebody's a-goin' around, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? What for? I've got a lot on the door, that's the way to be. They can feel the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are on me. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my song, their heads a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gals, got my gals, got my lor, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got the sun, got the moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of money, got to pray all the day. Keep the plenty, you know how to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of ride. Never want me long, and I'm well. Never want me to strive to be gone, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm the Lord? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, for heaven a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gals, got my gals, got my lor, got my lor. I've got my gals, got my gals, got my gals.
