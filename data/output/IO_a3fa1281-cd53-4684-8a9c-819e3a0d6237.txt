Something tells me I am needed at the front to fight the foe. Give the soldier boys a marching and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on, now, south, way, way, down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, follow this, it won't be long. We're on our way, hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, hooray. And since makes the heart grow thunder. Ooh. And since makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I thunder. Wondering, darling, if you're true. Distance only lands and shone's there. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near you. Be near you. Be near you. Be near you. Oh. She was happy till she met you. And the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you. You will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother. Just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over. Yes, she is. Christ, she is. Christ, she is. And the sun gets flowers. No, he dies so free. He dies so free. You will see the word you said. That's the time we too shall wear. When the harvest days are over. Just be near you. Just be near you. My just be near you. BBN SENSE He was loved with a strawberry dog, and the band played on. He glides from the floor with a trail he adored as the band played on. But his brain was so loaded, it nearly exploded. The poor girl would shake me along. He derries a girl with a strawberry friend, and the band played on. Sweet Adeline, my Adeline, at night, dear heart, for you I find. In all my dreams, your fair-faced be. You're the flower of my heart. Sweet Adeline, my heart. Sweet Adeline, my heart. He's only a man in a fearless day A beautiful sight to see You may think he's happy and free from care He's not about his dreams to be He's done when you think of a wasted life For you cannot make me wait And her beauty was sold For an old man's gold He's a bird in a gilded day A little brown car A shady green spark So happy home I find My heart's barely gone I love only one She's the girl I have to be mine Just one girl Only just one girl Where on earth I know What's there not my heart Come away She is just one day I'll be happy forever For an old man's gold I'll be happy forever Before there's a dream Wonder I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy forever I'll be happy I'll be happy forever The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End
