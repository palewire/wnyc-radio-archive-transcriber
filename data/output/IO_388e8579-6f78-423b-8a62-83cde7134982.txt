You are about to hear an address by Dr. Edward M. Bernica, Commissioner of Hospitals in New York City, who will speak on the subject, Our Municipal Hospital Crisis. Dr. Bernica. On Sunday afternoon, the Commissioner of Health, Dr. Harry S. Mustard, discussed the prevention of disease, the major function of the health department, and how the lack of funds prevented an optimum program of health protection for the people of our city. It follows logically that hospital needs for a family, a community, or a city have a direct relationship to the facilities for safeguarding health through education and disease prevention. While tremendous strides have been made in conquering the diseases of childhood and in prolonging the span of life, there still are many diseases that baffle medical science. The human organism is so complex that sudden illness may strike any one of us at any time. And beyond that are the degenerative diseases that are becoming more and more a problem in our aging population. It is for the treatment of disease that the vast network of hospitals is provided in our great city. From the flood of comment that has come in the wake of my recent reports to his honor the mayor on the condition of the municipal hospitals, there stands out for me the lead sentence in one of the editorials which said, New York City's hospitals are sick. Yes, our municipal hospitals are sick. Very sick. By this I do not mean to imply, however, that our patients are neglected. Not by any means. On the contrary, despite our many difficulties, the clinical care given the patients in the municipal hospitals of New York City is the best that can be obtained anywhere in the world. Our personnel is doing an heroic job against discouraging handicaps and included in the 7,000 members of our visiting medical staffs are the outstanding physicians, surgeons, and specialists in the country. But the serious overcrowding, the acute shortage of nursing personnel, the antiquated, obsolete, and even century-old buildings all militate against optimum patient care and our challenges that have won the interest and support of New Yorkers in every walk of life. At the outset, I should like to emphasize that no one is more concerned with the plight of our hospitals than Mayor O'Dwyer, who immediately upon assuming office two years ago sponsored in the Board of Estimate a $3 million appropriation for the most urgently needed rehabilitation and repair work to prevent the collapse of aging, outmoded hospital structures. New hospital construction and reconstruction have been given the highest priorities for capital expenditures and the Mayor and the Board of Estimate are leaving nothing undone to make more funds available for additional personnel that is needed. His Honor, the Mayor has repeatedly said that he wants the municipal hospitals of this city to have such high standards and to be so modernly equipped that the poorest citizen will receive the same fine medical and nursing care as those who have unlimited resources at their command. The letters, telegrams, telephone calls, and visits that have come to us since we made the situation known attest to the fact that most New Yorkers agree with the Mayor. How bad is our situation? You have seen pictures and stories spread over the front pages of your newspapers showing bed on bed, patient touching patient, many of them crowded into wards that are operating in 150 to 200 percent of their normal capacity. It is not human to crowd the sick together like so many cattle, nor decent to deny a patient the little privacy that he so sorely needs in his pain and anguish. I have spent the major part of my adult life in the municipal hospitals of New York, and in that 33 years, the situation has never been more critical than it is today. My work has spanned the period from the First World War through the lush 20s, the Depression years of the 30s, and the war years that we have just recently come through. Throughout this period, hospital construction never kept pace with the growth of our great city. Buildings on Welfare Island and at the farm colony on Staten Island that house many hundreds of sick and aged dependents are a century old, and what little new construction was done at Bellevue, for instance, replaced buildings that dated back to the War of 1812. Our largest tuberculosis center, the Seaview Hospital on Staten Island, is literally falling apart. It had 2,000 beds available some years ago, but it has crumbled down to a capacity of 1,400, and this includes beds and cots in every available space. It will take four 500-bed tuberculosis hospitals to replace Seaview alone and another 3,000-bed institution to replace the century-old Welfare Island City home and the Staten Island farm colony before we can even think of additional beds. We recently submitted to the mayor and to the Board of Estimate a total of 51 hospital construction projects that would cost some $350 million plus another $41 million for annual operating and maintenance costs. These are astronomical figures, particularly so in view of the city's stringent fiscal position. Subsequently, this list had to be revised and pared down to 17 absolute must items, which have to be done immediately. But even these totaled an estimated $135 million plus an annual operating and maintenance cost of $14 million. The question might well be asked, why was not something done sooner to forestall the desperate situation that now confronts us? Who is to blame for the inertia and lack of action in meeting the hospital needs of our sprawling, growing city? If there is any consolation in laying the blame at someone's doorstep, two world wars might be blamed. Previous administrations must share the guilt for not keeping pace with the needs during their times. Rising costs are a salient factor. The equally pressing demands for more schools, more health centers, better transit and housing facilities, sewage disposal plants, airport development, bridge and tunnel construction might be mentioned. But what good to blame anyone or anything? The all-important consideration must be that now there can be no further delay. The great city of New York has a very definite responsibility for the sick in its hospitals and for the aged and infirm in its homes, a responsibility it cannot deny or longer ignore. Let us look for a moment at that responsibility as it affects tuberculosis, for instance. The most conservative figure for additional beds needed for this disease in the five boroughs is 5,000. The Hospital Council of Greater New York recommends for the expected population of 1950 a total of 6,500 beds, of which 800 should be in general hospitals and 5,800 in tuberculosis hospitals. The bed capacity for tuberculosis patients in municipal hospitals today is less than 3,500. Dr. Mustard has called attention to the high incidence of tuberculosis among persons who regard themselves as well and that there were 3,245 deaths from tuberculosis in this city last year. Public health officials conservatively estimate that for every death from tuberculosis, there are 10 cases in the population. This would mean that we have upwards of 30,000 cases of this highly infectious disease in our midst. I'm confident that no one will argue with the estimate that at least 10,000 persons are walking the streets of New York today with active tuberculosis. All of us ride the crowded subways and buses and find ourselves in packed gatherings in the movies and stores and shops. A sneeze or a cough from an active case can infect you or me. It is a dangerous situation. The health department must have money to find all these cases and the hospital department must have funds to provide the necessary hospitals for them after they are discovered. It costs between $9 and $10 million to construct a 500-bed tuberculosis hospital and another million a year to operate it. Staggering sums indeed, but this again is a responsibility that the city can no longer forego. My time is running out and therefore I cannot list all of the individual items needed to rehabilitate the municipal hospital system. Furthermore, most of you know what is planned for your particular community. I would like to repeat, however, that our first and greatest need is for more chronic tuberculosis and cancer beds. For this, $135 million in construction costs and $14 million in annual operation and maintenance costs are needed immediately. Some of our general hospitals require attention to and before many more years pass and should be mentioned here. Metropolitan Hospital on Welfare Island, which dates back to 1839, must be replaced and soon. Queen's General needs additional wards. The new General Hospital in the Elmhurst section of Queens, which will replace the old city hospital on Welfare Island, dating back to 1861, must get underway. The new East Bronx General and Tuberculosis Hospital must be progressed. Coney Island Hospital is a study in obsolescence and decay. There must be an early replacement here. Bellevue Hospital, for the most part, needs reconstruction and modernization. Harlem is urgently in need of reconstruction, and this is likewise true of Gouverneur on the Lower East Side, Greenpoint and Cumberland Hospitals in Brooklyn, and Morrisania and Fordham in the Bronx. Adding these projects to the 17 musts for long-term tuberculosis and cancer patients brings our needs for funds to $283 million plus another $36 million for annual operation and maintenance costs. And if again we add to this the $13 million more that will have to be added to next year's budget for additional positions needed for patient care, it adds up to the staggering total of $332,590,650. The hospital is a community activity. With the church and school, it forms the foundation upon which rests the health and well-being of our people. The modern hospital has been called one of the finest flowers of our civilization. Shall we continue to have a sick municipal hospital system with bulging, crowded wards, with services that are understaffed and buildings that are crumbling and falling apart? Or shall we have new, modern hospitals, adequately staffed and equipped and capable of bringing all the great advances of medicine and the finest type of medical nursing care to our people? It can be done with your support. It can be done by all of you getting wholeheartedly behind Mayor O'Dwyer's legislative program for financing the city's health and hospital needs, which the mayor himself will outline to you in detail over the air in the very near future.
