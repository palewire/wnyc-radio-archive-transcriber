When you walk by a war bond, remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the boys overseas are giving their lives. You are only asked to lend your money. And on this theme, your city station microphones are set up at 29th Street and 7th Avenue on the southwest corner to bring you the ceremonies of the war bond rally of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry. Among the notable speakers to be heard will include our own mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Fiorello H. Ligardia. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Henry H. Engel, who is chairman of this rally. Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a privilege to present a great singing star who has graciously consented to be with us at this monster war bond rally. She has sung with the Metropolitan Opera Company, the San Francisco Opera Company, and is now one of the stars of that smash hit operetta, Rosalinda. It gives me great pleasure to present Miss Jean Merrill, who will sing our national anthem. art. Thealley's guest piano jouer seemed Ucean, who has01 caught his mail book. Oh, there was light Oh, there we watched As the planet is turning On the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gain proof through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say, God, God, God, God And who is there And the land of the brave And the love of him Thank you, Ms. Merrill. And now, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of this rally, I wish to present the chairman of the War Bond Committee of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry, Mr. George I. Fox. Ladies and gentlemen of the fur industry, I welcome you as chairman of the Bond Committee of the Fur Industry to this rally, which marks the opening of the greatest drive of the nation. The nation has attempted to raise a huge sum of $13 billion for the support of our boys in the field. The fur trade has pledged itself to participate to the extent of $10 million in bond stores this drive. I'm sure that every one of us, both employers and employees alike, will do their share in participating in this privilege, to share in the fight for freedom, democracy, and until victory is ours. I know the fur trade, then, will all to a man, will come along and not wait to be approached and coached to participate in this privilege. You will come along from your own free will, and buy buns as much as you can, so that we can share in the effort until the Nazis and the fascists have been wiped off the earth. We have a very elaborate program prepared for you. We have some nationally known singers and some well-known speakers, among whom our very beloved mayor, the Honorable Fiorello Lagaria, will speak to you in a little while. And now I'm going to introduce to you the young man who will take over to this master of ceremonies on this occasion, a man who's a nationally known artist, both on stage and screen, who has just come back from the coast, where he has entertained 195 camps. He is also appearing on the Campbell's program each Wednesday night. He is the star of the Siegfeld Follies. He's a man who gives of himself at all times that he's ever called upon to perform a duty for patriotic services and for very charitable causes. I give you the very fast-approaching number one comedian of the United States, our very beloved Milton Berle. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Fox, it's a wonderful announcement for a skin dealer. I'm very glad to be here today, ladies and gentlemen, on this wonderful rally. It's very nice and warm out here. I should have worn my earmuffs today. But I want to tell you, pardon me, I just got up. It's a pleasure and a privilege, really, on behalf of the fur industry, and I'd like to be half of the fur industry. It's really a thrill to be up here on this rostrum with all these. I guess all you ladies and gentlemen in this very vast audience are wondering who these very, very gorgeous-looking ladies are here with the roses in their hands. May I say that these ladies, I'd like to introduce them, have them stand up and take a bow. They're all mothers of all the boys from the fur industry that are seeing service. Let's give them a swell hand. Here they are. Thank you very much, ladies. Thank you. You look very, very pretty. Very. I want to tell you that everybody's going to be here. The mayor, Mayor LaGuardia, was supposed to be here a little earlier, but he's tied up. He's playing bingo up in 48th Street, you see. If he's here, I'm kidding, Fearella. But I have... Everybody, in fact, you know, the reason I'm here for another reason, I, uh... I, uh... Very, very glad because I have a brother. Uh, Mr. Fox, you can sit down. We saw your coat. Looks all right. Looks... Gets up and shows his coat. And, uh... Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf? I.J. Fox. I, um... No, pardon me. I mean George Fox. But it is really, uh... My brother's in the fur industry. He's a caracal curler. Got a wonderful job. You know how you can, uh... Curl caracal. They're curled already. Do I have to explain the jokes here today? But I want to tell you, it's really very, very, uh... A big thrill, ladies and gentlemen, really, to be up in this pond. Around there is very... In fact, uh... Eleanor Roosevelt was supposed to be here, but it was too near. And, uh... I'm a little tired out. I've been ironing all day and forging my ration card. And I want to tell you, it, uh... This is like trying to get laughs in a murder trial. Will you relax? Laugh when the world laughs with you. Cry and they put you under goodwill. I want to tell you... It's very, very difficult trying to get laughs when there's subway going underneath you here. But I want to tell you that I would like to introduce... I would like. I would like to go back to sleep. I would like to introduce... I'm really... I'm tired, really. I'm very happy, though, today. It's my anniversary. I've been married a year today. I don't know what to get my wife. She wants a man. I, uh... Oh, now you laugh. I like that, uh... Our New York Finest, all these very fine policemen, are doing a wonderful job here this afternoon. I want, I think, a swell hand for the New York's Finest, boys. Let's give... Let's give all the boys a hand. Except the guy up on 34th Street wouldn't let me through. And if he can hear me, I mean it. He's a... He's a Harvard man. And, uh... No, all kidding aside, all these fellas... I played a cop in my last picture. I made a picture called Margin for Error. Who saw the picture? Anybody see it? Three, four, five. Thank you. You did. Hello, Ben. I'm glad to see you. Ben Platt's here. I guess he wants me to mention his name. I mentioned it. Now you go back to your store. All right. I played a cop in that picture and I had the most important part in that picture in Margin for Error. Joan Bennett, she's in the picture too and I have the most important part. At the beginning of the picture, I opened the door and let Joan Bennett in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. That's the end of the joke. What do you want? Gasoline? Relax. May I present, may I present as our first surprise, ladies and gentlemen, may I present as our first surprise some kids from CCNY waving to me over there. How are you, kid? Fine, how are you? Playing hooky, huh? May I present four boys, ladies and gentlemen, that are from our very fine United States Coast Guard. All of them have seen action and fighting. One gentleman who was the head of the Southerners, Mr. Homer Smith. You've heard on the Columbia Broadcasting System and he's gathered all these boys and formed the Coast Guard Quartet, which is one of the finest singing quartets in the service. Now, the fellow members of the quartet are Ms. James Lewis, Thomas Lockhart, Martin Bowen, with Frank Boyle at the piano. Now, Homer, suppose you take over and tell him what we're going to do. Where's Homer? All right, Homer, our ladies and gentlemen, Homer Smith, a swell hand for Homer Smith. Thank you. Oh, yeah, I know you, Homer. How's everything? All right.

I wish Some of these employers Were trying to bring back Starvation wages And the sweatshops And Macy's And Bloomingdale's And Abraham and Strauss Could come here And see this ground And incidentally While we're fighting This war We are not going to permit Labor standards Is to be brought down Now let Bloomingdale And Macy And Abraham and Strauss And Lord and Taylor Take note of that And perhaps Look at their own payrolls And give their employees A better birth You know Ben Gold asked me to come here Make an appeal For this Second war loan And after he asked me To come here And make the appeal He just now told me You're oversubscribed already And of course I know That the fur industry Will come through As they always do You know As I said last night At Carnegie Hall The matter's very simple We either Loan the money To our government And get it back With interest Or else Hitler and the Japs Will come over here And take it away from us We get nothing back And we're not going to Let them come over here And that is why We want to make this Second war loan Not only successful We want to Oversubscribe it And I am sure That the flourishing Prospering Great industrial town Of New York Will lead the whole procession Now of course We have no illusions About this men It's going to be A long And difficult War There's no doubt As to the outcome But we must do A complete job And that means That there is a great deal Of hard and difficult Fighting ahead The news this week Is rather encouraging The French The British And our American troops Are chasing Rommel and his army Into the waters Of the Bay of Tunis The army Of the Soviet Republicans Are pushing back Every attempt Of the Nazi forces To break through Again The Russians Army Has now The Nazi army In the mud Up to their knees And pretty soon They'll have them In the mud Up to their necks It wasn't so many weeks ago When Hitler Was making preparations For his march Into Moscow And as I told you At the meeting Madison Square Garden The only time The Nazi army Will see Moscow Will be when they'll be Taken there As prisoners of war And yet As I say There's a great deal More fighting To be done And we have to fight Until We've beaten And crushed And destroyed The Japs Hitler And his little pal Mussolini too None of them Are any good And never were Any good And some of us Knew That They were no good All of the time So I want to Congratulate The fur industry Of New York City Employers And the organized Workers Of the fur industry In getting An early start In this War loan In setting the example To other

He's a business manager at the Furrier's Joint Council. He is one of the most elegant voices of labor.

And thirdly, let's see whether we can take our hands out of our pockets, all of us here. This is not just a meeting for the speakers from the platform. This is a meeting where all of you will have to speak. Those of you on the sides, all over, take your hands out of your pockets and the rest of you to the right of me and those in the front. Let the gentlemen from the Treasury Department, let the United States government representatives know that you are here not only to listen to speeches, but you are here to demonstrate your readiness to support with money and with everything until we smash Hitlerism and wipe them off the face of the earth. Get your hands out and put them up. And this pledge to the United States government representatives here. Let's see your hands. Take them out of your pockets. Let's see this pledge from everybody here at this audience. Come up with your hands. Take them out. They won't freeze. All over, down the other side. Express your opinion and your determination. Next. You have on this platform. You have on this platform. Her workers. Women. Mothers. Members of our union. Workers in this industry. Who have given their sons. In the United States armed forces. Some of them two sons. Some of them three. Some of them their sons and daughters. Some of them sitting on this platform. Your sisters. Working with you in your shops. Members of your union. Have had their sons. Over on the other side. Who have already made their supreme sacrifice. Who have already laid down their lives. So that you and I and the rest of us. In this world. May live free. Of the boot of Hitler. They are right here. The mothers. Your sisters. And your fellow members of your union. And your industry. You have here a mother. Of a hero. You have read the newspapers only the other day. Of a member of our union. A young worker by the name of Abrams. Who was a lieutenant. In one of the bombers. Fortresses. That sunk three. German ships in the Atlantic. That hero's mother is right here on this platform. These mothers. Have given their sons. And the United States Treasury Department. Is calling upon us. To give. Money. To buy bonds. So that. The United States government. May be able. To buy. The best. That the American people. And the American workers. Can produce. The best ships. The best trains. The best tanks. And guns. To their sons. And the sons of millions more. To put an end to Hitlerism. To put an end to slavery. To bring about the world. Free of the threats. Free of the slavery imposed by Hitler. And the conquered people. To bring about. A better and freer. World for all of us. These are the mothers here. Who have sent their sons for that purpose. Last night. The secretary. Of the treasurer. Mr. Morgan Cow. Spoke at Carnegie Hall. And his opening remarks. When he opened the speech. He said. The second friend. Is no military secret. We all know. That just. Over the horizon. We of the United Nations. Are piling up. The thunder clouds. Of the greatest attack. In history. Now. We are ready. To deal. A few blows. Ourselves. And there will be blows. That I can promise. That will rock. Nazi Germany. To its rotten. Bloodstained foundation. The secretary. Of the treasury. Of the United States. Government. The cabinet member. Of our government. Opened the speech. Last night. With a statement. That we are ready. And this second. Warbound drive. Is raised. In order to make possible. The invasion of Europe. In order to make possible. The joining of hands. Of our brave. American boys. Of the heroic boys. Of the British army. With the heroic people. And army of the Soviet Union. In one mighty invasion. Of Europe. That will once. And for all. Put an end to Hitlerism. And his slavery. And it is these bonds. That we. Made you to buy today. That will be. The answer. Of the fur workers. To the American government. That we will give. And give. And give. In every way possible. To make possible. The realization. Of the invasion. Of Europe. To make possible. Victory over Hitlerism. In 1943. In 1943. Now. It is my job. And present job. To introduce to you. The next. And last speaker. One. Who has inspired. And led. Our union. With its 80,000 members. All over the United States. And Canada. To make a record. Of war activities. That is a shining example. For the entire. Labor movement. In this country. One. Who is the inspirer. Of 7,000. Members of our union. Who are today. In the armed forces. And who inspires. These 7,000 members. To fight. In the front ranks. Of the American. Armed forces. And who will give. An account of themselves. In the same manner. And even more. Eroically. And even with greater. Sacrifice. Than the membership. Of our union. That has stayed behind. To support them. On this side. It gives me pleasure. To introduce to you. The president. Of the international. Foreign letter workers union. Van Gogh. Thanks. Seems. That we are bound. To enter. A new. Very important. And perhaps. Decisive phase. Of this. Great tragedy. Of mankind. It seems. That a great. Many developments. Will take place. In the year. Of 1943. It seems. That a great. Many battles. Will. Take place. In the very. Near future. And every. Battle. Will. Bring. Closer. The day. When. All of us. And the entire. Civilized. World. Will. Gather. To celebrate. The great. The great. Moment. Of the collapse. Of the Nazi. Cannibals. And the victory. Of the civilized world. Tables. Are definitely. Turning. Slowly. But surely. Not. Long. Ago. Hitler. War. And. And. His. Chiefs. Were. Bragging. About. The superiority. Of the. German. Weapons. Today. It is. Generally. Recognized. That. Our. Country. Alone. Succeeded. In. Outproducing. The. Northeast. To. The. Decree. That. Even. The. Nazis. Recognized. This. Fact. Both. In. Quality. And. Quantity. Our. Weapons. Are. Superior.

Of. His. Blitzkrieg. Methods. Not. Long. Ago. Churchill. Was. In. His. Speech. Stated. To. The. British. People. That. The. Only. Thing. That. We. Can. Offer. Them. Is. Sweat. And. Tears. And. Blast. Today. Hitler. And. Gables. And. Gairdings. Sing. That. Song. And. They. Talk. To. The. German. People. Of. Blood. And. Tears. And. Sweat. Not. Long. Ago. All. Of. Us. Were. Afraid. That. Hitler. The. My. Carrier. Is. Freak. To. Invade. The. British. Irish. Today. There. Is. A. Great. Deal. Of. Talk. About. Invasion. But. The. Invasion. Of. The. United. Nations. And. The. European. Continent.

Cannibal. Army. That. Threat. The. Entire. World. Come. In. As. The. Burry. On. The. Soviet. Russian. Battle. Fields. Will. Never. Fight. Again. On. The. Side. Of. The. Nazis. In. Order. To. Carry. Through. That. Great. Fight. Of. Mankind. We. Must. Make. Every. Effort. To. Help. Our. Government. Help. The. Armed. Forces. Of. The. United. Nations. To. Make. That. Possible. And. We. Gather.

At this time, may I ask you to take your heads off. I introduce. Ladies and gentlemen, with this unanimous decision of the fur industry to back the second war loan of the United States government, we bring to a close this program of which has been taken part of the 29th Street, 7th Avenue corner, at which point the war emergency board of the fur industry has held its war bond rally. Among the speakers that were heard on today's program was his honor, the mayor of the city of New York, Mayor Lagardia. Milton Burrell served as emcee for part of the program. Henry Engel, chairman of the war bond rally committee of the fur industry. George I. Fox, chairman of the war bond committee. Lou White, chairman of the war emergency board of the fur industry. And Gene Merrill, that is, a metropolitan opera star, who sang the Star Spangled Banner and the Army Air Corps song. And also, we just heard from the president of the Furious Union, Ben Gold. Ladies and gentlemen, we, before we leave, remind you that once again, when you buy bonds, you are only lending your money while your own brothers, sons, and husbands are giving their lives. And so, on the theme of any bonds today, we conclude this program, which has been a public service feature of your city station. This is the municipal broadcasting system. Thank you. Thank you.
