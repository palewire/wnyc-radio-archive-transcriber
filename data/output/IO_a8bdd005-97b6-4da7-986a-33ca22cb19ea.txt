Russia may control vast land areas and have millions of humans for armies, but as long as we control the seas, and we do control the seas, we are safe. And that is the reason that our committee is proud, Mr. Chairman, during the week to be tied up with Maritime Day and the Men of the Sea. Thank you, Mr. Carson. It is now my great pleasure to introduce Ms. Evelyn Sachs, a distinguished contralto who graciously consented to join us in our tribute to the American Merchant Marine.

Cavanaugh, Jr. Mr. Maloney, Collector Dirning, Admiral Cochran, distinguished members of the Armed Forces, Reverend Clergy, other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen After listening to Collector Dirning, Mr. Maloney and Mr. Cawson, in their review of but a few of the deeds and accomplishments of the American Merchant Marine, I think you can well appreciate the honor and privilege it is for me to participate briefly in the American Merchant Marine I think you can well appreciate the honor and privilege it is for me to participate briefly in this honor to that great arm of our American services. It is, though, a matter of regret that I must bring the word of the Mayor that because of the unavoidable change in our plans here today, he will not be present. He will review the midshipmen in City Hall later in the day, and he has asked me to pay his respects and give his greetings to Admiral McClintick and the staff of the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point. The Merchant Marine, whose deeds and exploits you have heard about, is so intimately entwined with our national security and our national welfare and the welfare of this port that they may almost be considered as one. Our nation, in the 133 years since the sailing of the steamship Savannah with the first American Merchant Marine crew, has grown to its greatest glory. It has survived the decay and destruction of many other nations. Our port, too, in that time, has reached its point of greatest development. Needless to say, as symbolized by the arrival in a few weeks of the new American liner United States and its American crew, our merchant marine has now reached the high point in its development. It is, however, very, very important we continue this healthy development of our American merchant marine. It seems to me there are three things that we must keep in mind as being fundamental to that development and well-being of that arm of our national services. First, we have the courage and the morale of the merchant seamen to consider. And I think we can have no misgivings as to those qualities. Recently, the dramatic episode of the flying enterprise, its courageous crew, and its heroic captain, Captain Carlson, served as a symbol of the great courage and the great morale of our American merchant marine. I say it served as a symbol. I say it served as a symbol because although that episode, by its dramatic and spectacular impact on people all over the world, came home to all of us, similar exploits, similar exploits, similar courageous deeds are carried out by our merchant marine every day in the week on every sea on the face of the earth. These deeds go unpublicized as far as the general public is concerned, but to those of us associated with the shipping industry, we have a deep and warm appreciation. And so we have no misgivings about the first fundamental characteristic that must be safeguarded. Secondly, there is the matter of ships. — — — — — and die on the vine. And it is in that connection that I believe we have a keen interest and an intimate familiarity and knowledge. The Port of New York, and make no mistake about this, is today, as it has been every day in the past, the finest and busiest port on the face of the earth. It may seem strange that we would have to stand up here on National Maritime Day and emphasize that point, which only a few years ago was considered as idiomatic by people all over the world. The reason we must emphasize it today is that the changes over the years have developed ports all around our great land, and that's a good healthy thing for the security of our nation. A one port land certainly would not be too secure. The development of these other ports, the public relations which attaches to them, the peculiar advantages that they may have, the careless approach to public relations in this port, the lack of a unified approach to the well-being of this port, the most important part of the country. And last but not least, the irresponsible and baseless, self-seeking critics who continue to cover certain portions of certain papers with their idle gossip, have made it essential that on every occasion such as this we must stand up and once again bring home to all of us who are interested and those who wish to be interested in this port that it is without exception the finest and busiest port in the world. We are more port-minded today than we have been in decades, but there is great room for improvement, and that port development must be carried on to greater heights. As we look about us here in a city of eight million people, we have to but consider the services and advantages of our tremendous parks and parkway systems, our tremendous hospital plant and hospital institutions, our vast and effective and honored police department and fire department, our sanitation departments, looking right here at these granite and steel towers that almost touch the skies of lower Manhattan, and knowing the tenants that are in these buildings, strikes a thought, and we can safely say that none of these things, not one of them, municipal departments, great buildings, successful tenancies, would exist in any measure as we see them now if it were not for the well-being and size and wealth of our port. That came first, and without it, these others will soon stagnate. And so I say port development must be carried to the point where the waterfront and the port of New York takes its place in the proper perspective as one of the few, and I emphasize few, two primary municipal responsibilities in this city. In closing, I join the other distinguished guests and with all of you in a very warm salute to the commandant and the officers and the men of the United States Merchant Marine Academy who have been delayed, and to our... ... ...as a public service feature of your city station.

I do not agree, and any man who has studied history will share my concern over the occasionally expressed and, I am afraid, frequently held view that the continued survival of American shipping services is not, in fact, of importance. I can think of no more convincing evidence than that which has confronted me personally during my two years as maritime administrator in Washington. I went to that assignment after the trouble in Korea had developed. It was only because there were ships, American merchant ships, actually in operation which could be immediately diverted, that it was possible for us to stem the first rush of the communist attack in June of 1950. It was necessary for us in the months immediately following to break out of the National Defense Reserve fleets over 700 vessels. This was possible because we had immediately available the three essential elements of shipping operations. Namely, the ships themselves in the laid-up fleets, skilled seafaring men, both licensed and unlicensed, and the other ships, and, what is equally important, a substantial group of American companies qualified and willing to undertake the management of these vessels. Up to 1952, these factors have continued to exist as a result of wise legislation and the fortunate economic conditions, which have obtained in the short interval since World War II. No one of these three elements, however, neither ships nor men nor operators, will continue to be available in the years ahead, unless action is taken not only by the government, but by the businessmen of this company, of this country, in assuring that a share of our overseas traffic, is carried in American ships. As a matter of fact, I believe, and very strongly, that the shipping companies of the United States, if they follow a wise path, will be able to furnish to you businessmen better service than will be available under any other flag. If they keep going, they say, I think this is right. To be able to tighten up, my única carbon promise is evident, and a strong weakness and every single mission series of all vehicles. My pleasure, and I think this is enough for a ever-second rally. If you have every Johann dohse of people who radiate, I can find the S skull that they visit us now on this way. I think this is what I think the Great Depression of the Virginreader meant to Glover is in the United States. shipping, and that the very arrival in foreign ports of fine American ships wearing the stars and stripes of this great country are the best advertising that you businessmen can get of the competence and high quality of the products which those ships are delivering. I urge upon you therefore no contribution to a charitable effort nor simple patriotism although in these troubled times I am convinced that patriotism is worthy of your thought but the simple realization of the fact that it is to your immediate advantage as well as to the long time prosperity and security of this country that ship American is a wise motto worthy of the serious consideration of all businessmen whose products come from overseas or leave our shores for delivery to other lands. Travel American will need no advocate when the American people realize that within six weeks this country will have at sea the finest and the fastest passenger vessel that the world has known. Before the summer is out you will have at sea the first of the 20 knot dry cargo ships of the mariner class and soon after that you will have at sea some of the new fast tankers which are building in our shipyards today. With these ships to chart a new course, shorter, faster, more reliable than that somewhat shaky path chartered by the old savannah, your prosperity individually and ours collectively will surely grow. I have spoken of the value of American ships almost completely aside from their part in the common defense of this nation. For that however, they are invaluable. For that they are indispensable. Thank you very much Admiral Cochran. We are deeply grateful to you, to our other speakers, our guests, to Miss Sacks for your kind participation in this program.
