I've had a very pleasant voyage, and we were not at all disturbed by the weather, and indeed the most lively thing I've experienced has been my arrival here today and meeting so many distinguished journalists and photographers, and having the pleasure of being asked a number of questions, which you will see as the next 24 hours work out, have either got me into trouble or not. That's one of those agrabble forms of intelligent anticipation in which we can all indulge. But this television has come to take its place in the world. They're rather an old-fashioned person. I have not been one of its principal champions, but I don't think it needs any champions. It can make its own way. And it's a wonderful thing, indeed, to think that every expression on my face at this moment may be viewed by millions of people throughout the United States. I hope the raw material is as good as the methods of distribution. among the amazing потребителейàng frånv ответ i Suchimä pitt Mauve Village is an enormous anchor believer of ultra-tonig bowels och smirre i barri� i makeixen Come on, come here, will you? My wife and I are very glad to be back again in the United States. It is a proud occasion for us to come to the United States in January 1953 as ambassador and ambassadress in Washington, at such an important moment in our common affairs. We have been particularly fortunate in travelling here today with our Prime Minister, Mr Winston Churchill. We shall now go down to Washington. I shall present my credentials to the President and begin work. We'd like to introduce Mr Paul Gore Booth, the Chief of British Information Service in the United States and in the whole Western Hemisphere. How do you do, Mr. How do you do? We wonder if you could tell us something about the visit of Sir Roger Makins and the Prime Minister Winston Churchill to this country. Yes, I'd be glad to do my best. The arrival of Sir Roger Makins, of course, has been planned for some time. We've known for about three months that Sir Oliver Franks would be retiring and his successor, Sir Roger, would be coming. So we've been making preparations for him and Lady Makins to arrive for some time. Then, rather later, round about Christmas, Mr Churchill was in communication with the President elect and as it turned out to be convenient for him to pay a brief informal visit at this time, he decided to come too and it is a coincidence that they should be travelling together. Oh, it's a very happy coincidence. It is indeed. Do you think Sir Roger will stay in New York with the Prime Minister before going to Washington? No, his intention is to go right on to Washington. The reason for that is that an ambassador can't begin to function as ambassador until he has presented his credentials to the President. I think that's going to happen on Wednesday. So Sir Roger will go right down to Washington and get on with the job of being ambassador. Without even meeting the President elect, is that right? I think that is right at the moment. The first thing always must be to present credentials to the President that is the President of the time. How long do you expect the Prime Minister to remain in the United States? He is expecting to remain until Friday next, that's four or five days, and then he will go on and have his holiday in Jamaica in the British West Indies. How long will he stay there? I think until about the 19th or so of January because Parliament meets again on the 20th and of course he will have to be back either on the 20th or very soon thereafter. Will he return to England by way of New York or direct from Jamaica? That we don't know yet. He hasn't told us what his plans are. And do you think he'll enjoy his sojourn in Jamaica with some painting and fishing and some just plain rest? Well I'm sure that he will. I remember his saying one time at a meeting of which I was present in the middle of the official business. He said, you know, people ought to devise themselves some kind of a hobby for their few leisure moments. It makes such a difference. And that was why he took out painting. I'd like to ask you something about the arrangements. They've been very elaborate. We're greeting both the Prime Minister and Sir Roger. And the press has been very cooperative as far as I've seen. Is it much work for you? Is it very difficult to plan all these affairs? Well I think one can say that initially it used to be quite a business. But nowadays I think that the press and the radio and TV people and the information services know each other so well and are so used to dealing with each other that these things which look very elaborate perhaps aren't quite as difficult as they used to be. However, the whole issue of a press conference is something that's unknown in Great Britain. Isn't that the case? Oh no, indeed not. The only difference of course is that there, our top political people do appear in Parliament. Yours don't. I mean the President and the Secretary of State of the United States don't appear in Congress. And therefore they use the press conference much more than our top political people can do because they make their statements in the House of Commons. But at the same time press conferences are very important and do play a part in our national life. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. No.
