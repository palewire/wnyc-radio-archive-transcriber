The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the bugle, I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, babe Goodbye, darling, I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am near, I am near the end Who I am near the end, I am near the end I am kneeled at the front to fight the foe. He was soldier boy on marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the people calling, goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, follow this, it won't be long. We're on our way, it's pit foray. We're going down south, foo-lay.
