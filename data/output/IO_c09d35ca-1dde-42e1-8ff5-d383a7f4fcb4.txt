Ladies and gentlemen, I am gratefully acknowledging the greetings from the Lord Mayor of York, the Right Honorable William Dobby, and extend in return the warmest good wishes of the people of this city to the people of York. New York, like old York, will always be young. Both cities are constantly renewing themselves because both peoples draw their culture from the same streams of Western civilization. It is not the buildings, the thoroughfares, the bridges, or mere size which make a city great. It is, rather, the people who inhabit the city. It is the spirit with which they approach their work, their play, their duties and obligations. It is the courage they show in adversity, the cheerfulness they possess in times of crisis. On this score, York is a great city. As for ourselves, we are growing. We have an immense plan for changing the face of New York, for making it more livable, more gracious. This plan will not be completed in one year or ten. It will take a lifetime, and the lifetime of our children, to make an ever-growing city meet the ever-expanding needs of its young, energetic, and vital citizenry. Our celebration this year of the city's golden anniversary is not simple self-congratulation. It is an attempt to remind New Yorkers of the progress of the city, and they have all helped to make. It is also an attempt to sketch out the future development of Greater New York with full confidence in the continuing peace of the world. And that future is being assured here in New York, where the United Nations meet in their permanent home. Thank you once again, Mayor Dobby, and all the people of York, for their thoughtfulness and good wishes in this important year, the 50th anniversary of our city. Thank you. Thank you.
