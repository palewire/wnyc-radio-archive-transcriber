The Municipal Broadcasting System presents Freedom's Ladder Freedom's Ladder with radio star Monica Lewis, piano favorite Melba Pope, and your genial master of ceremonies, the Amsterdam news columnist Bill Chase. How do you do? Greetings, salutations, a fun cheerio, and welcome once more to Freedom's Ladder, which is just an intimate program of music, a bit of chit-chat, and this and that, just to remind you that freedom is more than a mere word. The curtain rises now, and our cheerful little earful, and here is our own little teeny-weeny, lovable Melba Pope, of whom there is no humor on the 88, and the number is Embraceable You. The number 15 of questions began, and today is spoken often a lot more misряд olmak, and do not listen to others. Today is some terrifying kinds of jokes. The vast majority secretary logs themselves down to aagnery, and ONE very tragic story times the Eighth traditions of the Eastern wartime, The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End What a shame What a shame What show was that?

Well I like night club work but for a short period of time I don't like extended engagements It's pretty tough when you have to do three and four Yeah I do like extended engagements in radio I don't blame you Well of course now you've got a wonderful show I don't know just how much dough you get as compared to the dough we get here Which is practically nil Well I don't know I've done fairly well I should say as far as radio is concerned I hope to do much better I was on the Chesterfield show for 39 weeks And that was a nice run Now tell me in your formula do you have any set practice of big names or do you use talent if it's unusual talent? Well my program's only been on six or seven weeks And for the first few weeks we have tried to stick to names if possible I don't say just the biggest names I mean we've used up and coming artists like Bobby Doyle That's right I remember And Bobby is a signature artist He records on signature I record for signature too Good well I'll put in a plug it's free So we used Bobby and of course he did have his own show for a while for every shot But I mean compared to names like Lionel Hampton, Stan Kenton, Bobby's a newcomer, he's a youngster Wonderful Why don't you have this new guy on, Mel Tomei, I've heard an awful lot about him Yes well yes he's a very good singer We, as a matter of fact I was at a celebrity party thrown for him by Art Ford on the Milkman's matinee Oh great, yes I heard about that one Yes it was a lot of fun Well I think you've got a wonderful future in radio And not only that but I think you could do very well on the stage and a musical comedy perhaps Well thank you I hope to do something on Broadway I've been hoping for a long time but I haven't had the time or the energy to get around to really doing much about it Well you will And the movies, how about that?
