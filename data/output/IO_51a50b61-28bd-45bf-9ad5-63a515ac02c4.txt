The Mayor's Committee, consisting of Frank Brown, Regional Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Joseph O'Grady, Director of the City's Division of Labor Relations, and myself, met this afternoon for several hours and reviewed the present situation in the tugboat labor dispute. We have communicated with the parties and have arranged a meeting between the oil committees of the union and the owners for 10 a.m. tomorrow, Tuesday morning, and a meeting between the tugboat committees for tomorrow at 2 p.m. The meetings are to be held at the office of the City's Division of Labor Relations and the Municipal Building. Thank you.
