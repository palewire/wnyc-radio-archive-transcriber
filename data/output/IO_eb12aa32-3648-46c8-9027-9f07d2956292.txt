ceremony Dedicating the Christmas tree in City Hall Park Which will stand here as an emblem of beauty And of peace and goodwill There are some who seem to think That we should not cut down our trees For these purposes And they are so wrong Our trees grow in the forests And they are used for many purposes Some were cut down to form the masts Of lofty masts of ships in the older days Some are cut down to furnish timber for our houses Some have the most humble purpose Of being turned into pulp that makes paper To carry the spoken and the written word But what loftier purpose can be served By this beautiful tree that stands here Than to stand forth in City Hall Park As the emblem of our real civilization As that emblem of peace and goodwill That we need to show to the peoples of this city That we are a peaceful nation That our citizens from all lands Are here living peacefully together And that we breathe to the people of all the world Peace and goodwill Thank you, Mr. Isaacs I now
