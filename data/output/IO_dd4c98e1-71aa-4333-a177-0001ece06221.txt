General O'Dwyer General O'Dwyer It's now my privilege to introduce a general who is not a desk general, but a fighting general. A general who has fought with the Port Authority to make this terminal possible. He's fought side by side first for every worthwhile effort and has prevented what he considers special privilege preventing progress. It's a great pleasure to introduce General O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York. Thank you. The government, Governor Dewey, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen. On this site will be the bus terminal to take care of a large number of short-haul buses that come into the city from New Jersey and that do contribute a good deal to our traffic situation. Most of my trouble is not getting buses off the street, but getting buses to put on the street. They're screaming from Brooklyn and screaming from the Bronx and over in Queens. They want more buses, more buses. But that's the local ones. These have to do with the ones that come in from outside of the city. I think we'd be looking at this for the next 20 years in order to have the kind of a terminal that will serve the people of both states as well as this will. If we had to depend upon the city's money to do it. We just wouldn't have it. The Port Authority has come in and undertaken to do it. It will be a great boon to us. It will make it very convenient for those who come in. It will make it good for the city. I'm very grateful to all concerned for having gone ahead on this job. They've no attention to the extraordinary cost of construction that we face today. But looking at the public need, they've gone ahead and today we begin the job. My congratulations and gratitude to them all. Thank you, Mr. Carver.
