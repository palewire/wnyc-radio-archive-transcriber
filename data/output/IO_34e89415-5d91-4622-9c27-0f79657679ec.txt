Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. My fellow Americans, I am speaking tonight to the American people, and in particular to those of our citizens who are coal miners. Tonight this country faces a serious crisis. We are engaged in a war on a successful outcome of which will defend the whole future of our country. This war has reached a new critical phase. After the years that we have spent in preparation, we have moved into active and continuing battle with our enemies. We are pouring into the worldwide conflict everything that we have, our young men and the vast resources of our nation. I have just returned from a two-week tour of inspection, on which I saw our men being trained, and our war materials made. My trip took me through 20 states. I saw thousands of workers on the production line, making airplanes, and guns, and ammunition. Everywhere I found great eagerness to get on with the war. Men and women are working long hours of difficult jobs, and living under difficult conditions without complaint. Along thousands of miles of tracks, I saw countless acres of newly proud fields. The farmers of this country are planting the crops that are needed to feed our armed forces, our civilian population, and our lives. Those crops will be harvested. On my trip, I saw hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Young men who were green recruits last autumn, have matured into self-assured and hardened fighting men. They are in splendid physical conditions. They are mastering the superior weapons that we are pouring out of our factories. The American people have accomplished a miracle. However, all of our mass effort is none too great to meet the demands of this war. We shall need everything that we have, and everything that our allies have, to defeat the Nazis and the fascists in the coming battles on the continent of Europe, and the Japanese on the continent of Asia, and in the islands of the Pacific. This tremendous forward movement of the United States and the United Nations cannot be stopped by our enemies. And equally, it must not be hampered by any one individual or by the leaders of any one group here back home. I want to make it clear that every American coal miner who has stopped mining coal, no matter how sincere his motive, no matter how legitimate he may believe his grievances to be, every idle miner directly and individually is obstructing our war effort. We have not yet won this war. We will win this war only as we produce and deliver our total American effort on the high seas and on the battle front. And that requires unrelenting, uninterrupted effort here on the home front. A stopping of the coal supply, even for a short time, would involve a gamble to the lives of American soldiers and sailors, and the future security of our whole people. It would involve an unwarranted, unnecessary, and terribly dangerous gamble with our country for victory. And therefore, I say to all miners and to all Americans everywhere, at home and abroad, the production of coal will not be stopped. Tonight, I am speaking to the essential patriotism of the miners, and to the patriotism of their wives and children. And I am going to state the true facts of this case as simply and as plainly as I know how. After the attack of Pearl Harbor, the three great labor organizations, the American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the Railroad Brotherhood, gave the positive assurance that there would be no strike as long as the war lasted. And the President of the United Mine Workers of America was a party to that assurance. That pledge was applauded throughout the country. It is a forcible means of telling the world that we Americans, 135 million of us, are united in our determination to fight this total war with our total will and our total power. At the request of employers and of organized labor, including the United Mine Workers, the War Labor Board was set up for settling any dispute which could not be adjusted through collective bargaining. The War Labor Board is a tribunal on which workers and employers and the general public are equally represented. In the present coal crisis, conciliation and mediation were tried unsuccessfully. In accordance with the law, the case was then certified to the War Labor Board. The agency created for this express purpose, with the approval of organized labor. The members of the Board followed the usual practice, which has proved successful in other disputes. Acting promptly, they undertook to get all the facts of this case from both the miners and the operators. The national officers of the United Mine Workers, however, decried to have anything to do with the fact findings of the War Labor Board. The only excuse that they offer is that the War Labor Board is prejudiced. The War Labor Board has been and is ready to give the case a fair and impartial hearing. And I have given my assurance that if any adjustment of wages is made by the Board, it will be made retroactive through April 1st. But the National Officers of the United Mine Workers refused to participate in the hearings when asked to do so last Monday. On Wednesday, this past week, while the Board was proceeding with the case, stoppages began to occur in some mines. On Thursday morning, I telegraphed to the officers of the United Mine Workers, asking that the miners continue mining coal on Saturday morning. However, a general strike throughout the industry became effective on Friday night. Responsibility for the crisis that we now face, worked squarely on these national officers of the United Mine Workers, and not on the government of the United States. But the consequences of this arbitrary action threaten all of us, everywhere. At Tentat, yesterday morning, Saturday, the government took over the mines. I called some miners to return to work for their government. The government needs their services, just as surely as it needs the services of our soldiers and sailors and marines, and the services of the millions, who are turning out the munitions of war. You miners have sons from the Army and Navy and Marine Corps. You have sons who at this very minute, this split second, may be fighting in New Guinea, or in the Aleutian Islands, or Guadalcanal, or Tunisia, or China, or protecting troopships and supplies against submarines on the high seas. We have already received telegrams from some of our fighting men overseas, and I only wish they could tell you what they think of the stoppage of work in the coal mines. Some of your own sons have come back from the fighting front wounded. A number of them, for example, are now here in an Army hospital in Washington. Several of them have been decorated by their government. I could tell you, I could tell one of you, tell you of one from Pennsylvania. He was a coal miner before his induction, and his father is a coal miner. He was seriously wounded by Nazi machine gun bullets while he was on a bombing mission over Europe in a flying fortress. Another boy from Kentucky, the son of a coal miner, was wounded when our troops first landed in North Africa six months ago. There's another from Illinois. He was a coal miner. His father and two brothers are coal miners. He was seriously wounded in Tunisia while attempting to rescue two comrades whose jeep had been blown up by a Nazi mine. These men do not consider themselves heroes. They'd probably be embarrassed if I mentioned their names over the air. They were wounded in the line of duty. They know how essential it is to the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and ultimately millions of other young Americans to get the best of arms and equipment into the hands of our fighting forces and get them there quickly. The fathers and mothers of our fighting men, their brothers and sisters and friends, and that includes all of us, are also in the line of duty, the production line. Any failure in production may well result in costly defeat on the field of battle. There can be no one among us, no one faction powerful enough to interrupt the forward march of our people to victory. You miners have ample reason to know that there are certain basic rights for which this country stands, and that those rights are worth fighting for, and worth dying for. That is why you have sent your sons and brothers from every mining town in the nation to join in the great struggle overseas. That is why you have contributed so generously, so willingly, to the purchase of war bonds, and the many funds for the relief of war victims, here and in foreign lands. That is why, since this war was started in 1939, you have increased the annual production of coal by almost 200 million tons a year. The toughness of your sons and our armed forces is not surprising. They come of fine, rugged stock. Men who work in the mines are not unaccustomed to hardship. It has been the objective of this government to reduce that hardship, to obtain for miners and for all who do the nation's work a better standard of living. I know only too well that the cost of living is troubling the miners' families, and troubling the families of millions of other workers throughout the country as well. A year ago, it became evident to all of us that something had to be done about living costs. Your government determined not to let the cost of living continue to go up, as it did in the First World War. Your government has been determined to maintain stability of both prices and wages, so that a dollar would buy so far as possible the same amount of the necessities of life. And by necessities, I mean just that. Not the luxury, not the fancy goods that we have learned to do without in wartime. So far, we have not been able to keep the prices of some necessities, as low as we should have liked to keep them. That is true not only in coal towns, but in many, many other places. Wherever we find that prices of essentials have risen too high, they will be brought down. Wherever we find that price ceilings are being violated, the violators will be punished. Rents have been fixed in most parts of the country. In many cities, they have been cut to below where they were before we entered the war. Clothing prices have generally remained stable. These two items make up more than a third of the total budget of the worthless family. People who are故oking the population with aggression. Onlyemment, cant checkpoints though!以不能 imutsの妙 yeahを.

Your officer, who just sent this message on behalf of the people of the city of New York to my colleague in Mexico City. It's addressed to the governor of the Federal District of Mexico. That's the kind of a title that I'll handle to have. It is my pleasure as mayor of the city of New York to extend to you, and on behalf of the people of the city of New York, greetings, salutations, and congratulations upon the 133rd anniversary of the independence of our great and nearest southern brother-in-arms, the Republic of Mexico. We are here at City Hall in New York celebrating your anniversary, just as if we were in Mexico City, for we are doing so by listening to the strains of music by your own typical band. It has been an enjoyable ceremony, and my only regret is that you, my dear colleague, could not be here with us to enjoy it. And I am sincere when I say the people of the city of New York send their fraternal greetings to the people of the Republic of Mexico. We are friends, we are brothers, because we want to be friends and brothers. We love each other not because of a treaty or a trade agreement. We love each other because we understand each other. We respect each other. And size and population makes no difference. We recognize forever the sovereignty of the Republic of Mexico and are willing to help to defend it at any time. And now, maestro, may I express to you my own personal welcome and congratulations for your splendid musical organization. And permit me to do so, and not as mayor, but for myself and my fellow members of Local 802 of the Musical Union of the Federation of Musicians. If there is one thing every mayor loves, it's harmony. And I want to thank you, your excellency, for gracing this occasion. And we will now call this ceremony to an end with Viva Mexico! Viva Independencia! DIANA GANAI GENER Lemon Get your hands brushed againstgaeton And so once again, ladies and gentlemen, City Hall Plaza has been the scene of very colorful ceremonies marking the occasion of the 133rd anniversary of Mexican independence. Ceremonies which were graced not only by many notables of both this country and of the Republic of Mexico, but by the Orquesta Typica of Mexico under the direction of Don Pablo. Our ceremonies began with the playing of the two anthems, the fire department band of the city of New York playing the Mexican anthem and the Orquesta Typica of Mexico responding by playing the Star Spangled Banner. The mayor of the city of New York then introduced the orchestra in the first number, the Marta Internacional, and then introduced in turn the president of the Pan American Society, Mr. Frederick E. Hassler, representing the Secretary of State, Mr. Charles A. Page, the Consul General of Mexico in New York City, Señor Ricardo G. Hill, and Dr. Rafael de la Colina, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C. The Orquesta Typica of Mexico under the direction of Don Pablo played, besides our own national anthem and the Marcha Internacional, the famous Guadalajara in which he was joined by his chorus, the march, Four Powers, and La Mixteca sung by one of the members of the chorus, with the addition of an accroar of which we do not know the title. The people here in City Hall Plaza have certainly enjoyed these very colorful ceremonies commemorating the 133rd anniversary of Mexican independence. A program of music at work, of course, was not heard in order that we might bring two listeners of that program these colorful ceremonies from City Hall Plaza. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
