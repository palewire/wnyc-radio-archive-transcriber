Boys and girls, I address you as one deeply concerned about your health and well-being. I know many of your parents are listening in today, but I wish you would carry my message to those fathers and mothers who could not hear this broadcast. The message is this. The City of New York will cooperate with the National Food Conservation Program to the fullest extent, but without the slightest impairment of the nutritional values of your school lunches. I have ordered that there be no increase in the selling prices of school lunches, and that the school program be expanded and strengthened to afford the families of our community the maximum possible assistance in maintaining an adequate diet for their growing children. I also earnestly recommend that those children who do not have lunch at school be encouraged to participate in the school milk program. During this campaign, not only will you learn the need for conserving food and avoiding waste, but you will also learn to thank God for the plentiful food we have here in America. You will learn the needs of the unfortunate children in other lands, and as a reward, you will earn the blessings that come through those who share generously with their less fortunate fellow beings. I join with the superintendent of schools in asking the cooperation of all children, parents, and community agencies in a united effort to promote the cause of world peace by helping to prevent starvation and distress in other countries and to maintain the health of our own nation by aiding in controlling high food costs. I am sure you will do your share and more.
