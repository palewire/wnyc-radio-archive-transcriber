Good afternoon. From the steps of City Hall, WNYC is bringing you a broadcast of New York City's reception of the Mayor of Jerusalem, Solomon Z. Shragai. Mayor Impeletere is here, as well as Grover Whelan, Chairman of the Mayor's Reception Committee. Cars have just rolled up, official cars, one of which is bearing the Mayor of Jerusalem, who has just received a tremendous ovation from the crowds that are lining the City Hall Plaza out here in front of us. It's a cold, cloudy day, but the people have turned out en masse to see this tremendous reception that is being given the Mayor. Mayor Shragai arrived yesterday at New York International Airport, Idlewild, Queens, and was given an ovation from representatives of the city and from delegates of rabbinical and Jewish communal organizations. The white-bearded 52-year-old Israeli official was accompanied by his wife, Miriam, and he was welcomed by Supreme Court Justice Charles E. Murphy, who spoke in Hebrew and said, the people of New York City welcome, Your Honor, with greetings of peace. Incidentally, the Mayor, with a smile, remarked that it was the first time he had ever heard an Irishman speaking Hebrew, and he said he understood every word of it. As another bit of an aside, Justice Murphy later admitted that he had given considerable time to mastering greeting. The music that you hear in the background is being provided by the Department of Sanitation Band, and also on the program, music-wise, will be the Police Department Glee Club. Presiding over the program today, the Honorable Charles E. Murphy, Vice Chairman of the Mayor's Reception Committee. We'll hear on the program the national anthems of the United States and Israel. There's the ovation right now given for the Mayor of Jerusalem, Mayor Shragai, as he steps out of the official limousine and mounts the stairs that bring him to the speaker's platform directly in front of us. The welcoming address will be given by the Honorable Vincent R. Impeletere, Mayor, and then the response will be given by Mayor Shragai. The response, incidentally, will be in Hebrew. There will then follow a translation by Mr. Charles Bick, who is President of Hapo el-Hamasrahi of America. Selections, as we said, by the Police Department Glee Club. The finale played by the Department of Sanitation Band, the band that you hear right now. And the official motorcade is now passing directly in front of us with a full police motorcycle escort. The visiting mayor, while he was here yesterday, said that there was little friction in Jerusalem because of the partitioning. And he pointed out that about 154,000 Jews lived in the new section of which Mayor Shragai was mayor. And 28,000 to 30,000 in the old quarter. Mayor Shragai said the population of the new city is fully conscious of its solemn undertaking to the international community regarding the grant of free access to Christian pilgrims to the old city. And thousands of such pilgrims have crossed the lines in security and goodwill during the last few years. There's hardly any friction between the authorities of the old and new parts of Jerusalem. This, as we said, was part of a statement by Mayor Shragai given yesterday. The mayor then said civil authorities meet regularly to consider questions affecting the populations of both areas. And he expressed the hope that access will soon be granted by the government of Jordan for Jewish pilgrims to the Wailing Wall and that the way to Mount Scopus will also be open. Mayor Shragai, incidentally, is here for a three-week tour of several cities in conjunction with plans for celebrating the 3,000th anniversary of the founding of the Kingdom of David in Jerusalem, as well as for a speaking tour on behalf of the United Jewish Appeal. The Jerusalem celebration will begin in October, and it will include an exposition, The Conquest of the Desert. That exposition will continue for a year. Yesterday, greetings also were extended to the visitor by Benjamin Glazer, chairman of the board of the Jewish Morning Journal and head of the reception committee, and Charles Bick, the president of the Hapo al-Hamasrahi of America, the religious labor Zionist movement. As we told you earlier, Mr. Bick will be giving a translation of Mayor Shragai's response to the Honorable Vincent R. Impeletari's welcome address. That response will be in Hebrew. And now we go to the speaker's platform. The Department of Sanitation band will now give us the national anthems of the United States and of Israeli.
