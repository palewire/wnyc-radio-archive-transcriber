I've got no car, got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their kids and their kids, Got a lock on the door. Pray somebody's a-goin' for a problem, But without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? I've got no luck on the door. That's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor. That's okay to be. For the things that I try, Like the stars in the skies are on me. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, And nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my tongue, And a-head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gal, got my gal, Got my gal, got my gal, Got my gal, got my gal. I've got plenty of nothing, And nothing's plenty for me. I've got no sun, And the moon, And the people see. I've got plenty of nothing, And nothing's plenty for me. I've got no sun, And the moon, And the people see. The folks with plenty of plenty, Got to pray all the day. Keeps with plenty, You're not the worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, In a time of life. Never want me long as I'm well, Never want to strive to be good, To be bad, What the hell, Why you glad I'm alive? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, And nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, Got my gal, For heaven's a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gal, Got my gal, Got my lord, Got my lord, Got my lord, You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, From Gershwin's Porgie and Beth.
