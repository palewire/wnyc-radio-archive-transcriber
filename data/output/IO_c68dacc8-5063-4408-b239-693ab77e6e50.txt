I have a statement that I should like to make. If I may, I shall read it to you. My fellow citizens have made their choice and have selected General Eisenhower and the Republican Party as the instruments of their will for the next four years. The people have rendered their verdict and I gladly accept it. General Eisenhower has been a great leader in war. He has been a vigorous and valiant opponent in the campaign. These qualities will now be dedicated to leading us all through the next four years. It is traditionally American to fight hard before an election. It is equally traditional to close ranks as soon as the people have spoken. From the depths of my heart, I thank all of my party and all of those independents and Republicans who supported Senator Sparkman and me. That which unites us as American citizens is far greater than that which divides us as political partisans. I urge you all to give to General Eisenhower the support he will need to carry out the great tasks that lie before him. I pledge him mine. We vote as many, but we pray as one. With a united people, with faith in democracy, with common concern for others less fortunate around the globe, we shall move forward with God's guidance toward the time when his children shall grow in freedom and dignity in a world at peace. I have sent the following telegram to General Eisenhower at the Commodore Hotel in New York. The people have made their choice, and I congratulate you. That you may be the servant and guardian of peace and make the dale of trouble a door of hope is my earnest prayer. Best wishes, Adley E. Stevenson. Thank you. Someone... Someone asked me as I came in down on the street how I felt. And I was reminded of a story that... a fellow townsman of ours used to tell, Abraham Lincoln. And they asked him how he felt once after an unsuccessful election. We won't ask me! He said... He said he felt like a little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark. Said it... that he was too old to cry, but it hurt too much to laugh. All right, ladies and gentlemen, there you have it. Governor Stevenson conceding. And believe me, watching that here in the hall, I believe the most touching thing, if you'll see the pictures and the papers and so forth, notice, please, were his two sons who were so proud in Chicago at the convention and beamed and smiled at their dad being nominated for the presidency on the Democratic ticket, standing behind him as he conceded defeat to General Eisenhower. Well, it's been Holland Angle and Les Higbee here at Springfield. And Les, what do you want to do to wrap it up? Just as we leave, Governor Stevenson, before he leaves the platform, is posing once more for the photographers. So I guess at this point, we'll say, now back to Mutual's election headquarters in New York. One, two, three, four, of the Зarr��게 Monapons. But in New York, guys let go back to Wyoming. Wayne, am I coming back to you? Is having the difference in the Volk, the Red belt call on the
