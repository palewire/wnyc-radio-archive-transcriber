Well, I want to let my good friends know that there's been 300 years of royal welcome That we have in the Borough of Brooklyn And in this Borough We gather many tongues of many nations all over the world And we live all happy together No matter what race we come to No matter what our religion is God has given us that feeling that we shall continue to love one another Irrespective of our religion, our politics As long as we are all good friends together I say in this great Borough In 300 years It has developed And it's been a thing of an inspiration for the whole world Those that have never had the chance to see our great Borough Highly come here To see our tall buildings Our great manufacturers Our many things of the interest That help supply the good things all over the world Oh, people When the opportunity comes to you Kindly visit our Borough We are the Borough of good-hearted people Good-natured people No drive was ever started in the Borough of Brooklyn That ever fell down This Borough has been generous in everything War-front drives Red Cross drives War-front drives Cancer drives And many, many others Because the people of Brooklyn were always generous And they give They give them out to this hunger famine all over the world And I hope the world in return Won't take advantage of ours As has been done on many occasions But love and a joy, the friendship Not alone of the Borough of Brooklyn But the good people That come from all parts of the world To make our country what it is today And Brooklyn is one of the springs in our country That has developed And we in Brooklyn are very, very proud That we are residents of this Borough I thank you Now, Pete, you've committed a grave error You haven't said a word about Greenpoint Well, I wanted to be a little modest I want to feel this way That to me Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world It is a spot Where I was raised and first seen the light of day At number 132 Eagle Street Thanks be to God there was a Greenpoint Thanks be to God that the light of day gave me my opportunity And to the people of Greenpoint I worked and worked the same as every other man And labored on the docks I pulled lumber I worked in the whole of vessels I'm proud and proud I was a long shark And I was a long shark And I was a long shark And I was a long shark And I was a long shark And I was a long shark And I was a long shark And I was a long shark And I was a long shark And I was a long shark And I'm delighted to say that I worked with men And I've done the same thing as every other man done Work for an honest living And thanks be to God for that Thanks be to God for that As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street We get some idea of the development of Brooklyn As we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall It's 98 years old Just two years more And we'll have an anniversary For the oldest public building housing a Borough President It may interest you to know that This building was started in 1836 And then a depression set in It lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years And then the building was finally erected in 1848 That's when it was first occupied We paid $52,000 for the land Which today is assessed for $3,600,000 Over there on the right hand side That old Arbuckle building That's coming down And we're going to build $11.5 million Kings County Supreme Court building Then you go down a little further And we're going to have a brand new post office site The old post office building We're still going to keep there And we're going to renovate that And use it there And we're going to... ...we're out of a car Thanks a lot We're here at Brooklyn At Borough Hall As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street We get some idea of the development of Brooklyn As we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President?
