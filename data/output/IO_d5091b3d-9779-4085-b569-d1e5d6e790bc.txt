There'll be a splendid review of this reception in the Aldermanic Chamber. I beg your pardon, I'm going back. I'm thinking more of history than I am of facts. I'm talking to death settlement, then I think of Alderman. It's now the council, as you know. Well, here in the council chamber itself, a very, very beautiful room. Right across from me is that wonderful portrait of Lafayette, valued at $350,000, that was painted by one of the outstanding men of communication, the inventor of the telegraph, Mr. Morse. It does seem amazing that a man could have two such diametrically optic talents and have them so great and in such great abundance because the telegraph itself was a great development, as radio telegraphy was later on. And Lafayette himself said, and we can't take it from any better authority, that Mr. Morse's portrait of him was one of the finest and most like life of any that he had ever had painted by any artist. He stands there in his dark brown coat, rather deep yellow trousers, in a very interesting background that Mr. Morse has created that is indicative of the time that Lafayette visited here. And now here's our guest, and there's the applause, and the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, is again smilingly the host to His Excellency Gabriel Gonzalez Videla, President of the Republic of Chile. And now they're taking their place on the rostrum here, and in just a few moments, we'll have the formalities as Mr. Coleman's voice is heard over the microphone. Mr. Johnny Coleman is Acting Chairman of the Mayor's Committee of Reception. Just a moment now for personal introductions. The photographers are looking very alert. They never miss a trick. It's a good thing they don't, because when we go back into the morgues, as we call the photograph files of the press, when we go back into these files, we're able to recapture these events. And you know, to those of us who are in them from year to year, it's quite surprising the faces we recognize and the facts of Czech as we look at these pictures that the photographers are so absolutely meticulous, demanding, and sure to get. And God bless them for it, because we have an impeccable record because of their splendid efforts. They don't think very much of prodigal, because when everybody is bowing and polite, they say, take off your hat, shake hands, smile. And of course, the guests, no matter how distinguished he or she may be, realize it's a record of history. They're doing a job. They're doing a wonderful job. And they're having time for too much formality, because the pace of the present-day world means get results, and we'll rest in the midst of those grand achievements. Well, now, Mr. Coleman is just making a few necessary presentations. He's assembling his guests around the mayor here on the rostrum in the council chair room. And now the cameramen are having their innings. They're holding up everything for a moment, but that's important. And these flashes of lightning are quite interesting as we catch glimpses of those faces, temporarily lightened by the brilliance of the flash. Now Mr. Coleman is getting ready to make the introductions. If the photographers will let him, they're still calling out orders. And, well, I say orders, you know what I mean. They want to get a picture that will thoroughly portray the friendliness, the joy and the pleasure of this magnificent spring day, when the Republic of Chile and the Republic of the United States of America meet here in historic City Hall, a few blokes from where it all began at the corner of Nassau and Wall Street, when George Washington was inaugurated as president. And don't forget you're invited to the inaugural ceremonies of George Washington, April 28th, Friday, at the same spot. The 30th is the actual date, but coming on a Sunday as it does, it has been moved up to Friday the 28th. The Excellency, Mr. Mayor. And now Mr. Coleman has just addressed the mayor. The reception this morning will open with the National Anthem of Chile by the Department of Sanitation Band and will be followed by the Star Spangled Banner by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. The National Anthem of Chile The National Anthem of Chile The National Anthem of Chile The National Anthem of Chile The National Anthem of Chile Oh, say can you see, by the long, early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the Greece And the home of the brave Mr. Johnny Coleman. Your Excellency, Your Honor, most distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. It's an unusual and most honorable position for me to be here today In the place of Mr. Grover A. Whalen, because I believe, as I was thinking it through yesterday, I think it's the first time in many years that Grover has missed receiving a head of a state, but he was in Europe and unfortunately can't be here. So I want to extend the greetings of the city to you all and say to you, Mr. Mayor, that I have the deep honor to present publicly to you the President of the Republic of Chile, the Honorable Gabriel Gonzalez Videla and Mrs. Videla.

In fact, he participated in the organization of the United Nations at the memorable conference of San Francisco in 1945. His nation and ours stand shoulder to shoulder in the cause of freedom and democracy. And the firm policy of his country is one of friendship and solidarity with the United States on the basis of equal sovereignty. President Gonzalez comes to us as a good neighbor who recognizes that his country and ours have a vital common interest. Our interest is that the nations of the Americas be free, prosperous, and united against aggression from within and without the vast boundaries of our hemisphere. Like all good friends, President Gonzalez is visiting our home. He will talk to the people and with the official families of this and other cities. He will visit our great power plant at the Tennessee Valley and other developments that have made a fuller life for the citizens of our country. He will learn of our achievements and of our problems, too. He will find many a common basis on which knowledge can be exchanged to help his country and ours as well. Mr. President, I know you are going to be visiting with us for some days to come.

Con múltiples emociones recibo la calurosa bienvenida de la ciudad de Nueva York. Comprendo que tanto las palabras tan amables del señor Alcalde, como la acogida que me dispensan, que me han dispensado en este momento los habitantes de esta metrópolis, van dirigidas al representante de un pueblo que siente y practica los ideales democráticos que han hecho grande y respetada a esta gran nación de los Estados Unidos de Norteamérica. A Nueva York llegaron en todas las épocas los hombres que huían de la opresión y la tiranía en tierras extrañas. Así en esta magnífica ciudad, que es hoy día la capital del mundo y la capital de las Naciones Unidas, se funden como en un crisol diversas razas, diversas lenguas, diversas ideologías religiosas. También en mi país, señor Alcalde, ha constituido a través de su historia un refugio para quienes buscaban tranquilidad y libertad espiritual. Esta característica democrática de mi pueblo lo ha llevado a entonar en el himno de nuestra canción nacional, que Chile la tumba será los libres o el asilo contra la opresión. Vos, señor Alcalde, personificáis la vitalidad de esta democracia, la igualdad de oportunidades que ofrece para que todos los hombres que laboran por su grandeza obtengan el justo reconocimiento de sus esfuerzos. Venido de tierra extranjera, habéis llegado a la dirección de la más grande ciudad del mundo. Quisiera esta oportunidad de recordar que también un hombre de origen de la Alemania, que el presidente de la Alemania, que el presidente de la República de Chile dejó huellas profundas en la historia de mi patria. El libertador de mi país. El primer jefe que tuvo en la República de Chile fue Bernardo O'Higgins. Habéis hecho mención, señor alcalde, del rol que me ocupo desarrollar como delegado de Chile en la Conferencia de San Francisco. Hoy, como gobernante de una nación democrática, siento el legítimo orgullo de haber sido uno de los firmantes de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas. Todos los esfuerzos de Chile, así como los de la gran nación norteamericana, están consagrados al reabustecimiento de la Organización de Naciones Unidas, que constituye para nosotros la única y la última esperanza de alejar al mundo del flagelo de una nueva guerra. Agradezco, señor alcalde, vuestras cálidas palabras y de vivo corazón tributo mi gratitud y mi admiración a los ciudadanos de esta ciudad extraordinaria. Quiero que sepáis que el pueblo de Chile, que es su presidente, que en ellos tenéis un firme y leal defensor de los postulados democráticos, que son la base indispensable de una vida digna, de una vida noble, de una vida próspera y al mismo tiempo de una vida absolutamente libre para nuestro espíritu, y también para todos aquellos individuos que perseguidos en otras tierras buscan en los Estados Unidos como han buscado en Chile estos ideales de justicia y de libertad.
