The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End the hundreds of years of welcome that we have in the Borough of Brooklyn. In this Borough, we gather many tongues of many nations all over the world. We live all happy together, no matter what race we come to, no matter what our religion is. God has given us that feeling that we shall continue to love each other, irrespective of our religion and our politics, as long as we are all good fellows together. I say in this great Borough, in 300 years it has developed and has been an inspiration for the whole world. Those who have never had the chance to see our Borough, come here to see our tall buildings, our great manufacturers, our many things of the interest that help supply the good things all over the world. Oh, people, when the opportunity comes to you, kindly visit our Borough. We are the Borough of good-hearted people, good-natured people. No drive was ever started in the Borough of Brooklyn that ever fell down. This Borough has been generous in everything. War-Brun drives, Red Cross drives, War-Brun drives, Cancer drives, and many, many others, because the people of Brooklyn were always generous and they give, they give them out to this hunger famine all over the world. And I hope the world in return won't take advantage of us, as has been done on many occasions, but love and enjoy the friendship, not alone of the Borough of Brooklyn, but the good people that come from all parts of the world to make our country what it is today. And Brooklyn is one of the springs in our country that has developed, and we in Brooklyn are very, very proud that we are residents of this Borough. I thank you. Now, Pete, you've committed a grave error. You haven't said a word about Greenpoint. Well, I wanted to be a little modest. I want to feel this way, that to me, Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world. It is the spot where I was raised and first seen the light of day, at number 132 Eagle Street. Thanks be to God there was a Greenpoint. Thanks be to God that the light of day gave me my opportunity. And to the people of Greenpoint, I worked and worked the same as every other man and labored on the docks. I pulled lumber. I worked in the whole of business. I'm proud of that I was a long shaman. I'm delighted to say that I work with men and I've done the same thing as every other man done. Worked for an honest living and thanks be to God for that. As we stand here and look down historic Booth Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak for a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? Well, I'd surely, I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building housing a borough president. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836 and then a depression set in. It lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected in 1848. That's when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down and we're going to build 11 and a half million dollar Kings County Supreme Court building. Then you go down a little further and we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building we're still going to keep there and we're going to renovate that and use it there. We're out of a car. In other words, thanks a lot. We're here at Brooklyn, at Borough Hall. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building, housing a borough president. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836 and then a depression set in and it lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected in 1848. That's when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down and we're going to build $11.5 million dollar, Kings County Supreme Court building. When you go down a little further, we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there and we're going to renovate that and use it for a federal court. This whole Brooklyn Civic Center is going to be flanked on both sides by public buildings. And right in the center of it, it's going to be a war memorial. And it's going to be a useful one instead of brick, lime, lumber and cement. It's going to be in honor of the 327,000 boys and girls who fought in this war. And don't forget, Brooklyn supplied more in that 327,000 of many of 39 states in the union. In this war memorial, you're going to have an auditorium that holds 1,500 people. And then you're going to have a room on the right where the trophies that our boys captured from the four corners of the world are going to be on display. And on the left hand side is going to be a room in bronze, where the names will be inscribed of every boy and girl who made the supreme sacrifice. And downstairs, this is very interesting and I believe you'll like it. We're going to have a room for each of the veterans organizations, which isn't anywhere in the city of New York. We're going to have the American Legion, the Kings County, the Spanish War Veterans, the Catholic War Veterans, the Jewish War Veterans. They're all going to be down there in that one building. So if any of these 327,000 veterans need assistance, they'll have a central location point to which to go. Thank you. I appreciate you very much, Mr. President, your busy life, uh, stepping, uh, by this way and taking a few moments. That was quite a celebration you had down with Hamilton Ferry, wasn't it? You want to say a word about that? Yes, that was a big thrill. I'll tell you a little about that. A ferry boat, known as the Moran Flugboat Company, supplied as a company. Well, he lives in Brooklyn and he's a resident. I wonder if we can pick up somebody here, will you? I shouldn't say pick up, that's the wrong term. He, he, he, he. He walked across the square with Pete McGinnis sometimes, and he had a young man shook hands with him and he says, How are you, he says... I don't know.
