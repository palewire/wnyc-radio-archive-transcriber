Radio's microphones are now in the Skyline Ballroom of the Hotel Teresa at 125th Street and 7th Avenue in its seventh biennial convention and the 25th anniversary of the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Mr. A. Philip Randolph is about to introduce the Secretary of Labor, the Honorable Morris J. Tobin. Mr. Randolph. Does not only come to speak in his own right as the Secretary of Labor, but also to speak for the President of the United States. When I first heard Secretary Tobin at the FFL convention, I said that at the first opportunity, I was going to make an effort to bring him before a convention of the Brotherhood for two reasons. One, the substance of his talk, the content of his speech, and second, the eloquence and force with which he made it. And so, we have been fortunate in bringing him here on this occasion. Only an hour or so ago, he joined with us in a luncheon given by the City of New York under Acting Mayor Impeletere at the Waldorf Astoria for the members of the board of the International Board of our organization and its offices. And so, Secretary Tobin, we are glad to welcome you here. And let me just mention this sidelight. We have under the Railway Labor Act what is known as the National Railroad Adjustment Board. It is the agency for the adjustment of disputes that arise in the railroad industry between carriers and their employees. The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, though representing and qualifying, are under this act has been denied the right to select members to sit on this board. And the organization proceeded to correct that condition. When we presented this matter to Secretary Tobin, he forthwith and immediately took action on the matter, caused a hearing to be held in the auditorium, in the office of the Department of Labor. And as a result of the initiative, the forthrightness with which he handled the matter, the organization, the Brotherhood was able to sweep aside the obstacles and barriers that stood in the way of the Brotherhood selecting members to sit on the National Railroad Adjustment Board. Today, we enjoy that right. We now are preparing to have a porter sooner or later to sit on the board as a member and through his judgment to pass on questions involving claims and grievances of the various railway employees of this nation. We are paying our way. And I may say that at a considerable cost, because the railway unions that practice before certain divisions of the board must pay for the maintenance of the board. must pay for the maintenance of the personnel. And so Secretary Tobin comes to us as one who has directly participated in the struggle of our organization to establish its right to participate in one of the most important agencies of the government affecting railway workers. And so delegates and officers of our convention, I'm delighted and happy to present to you Secretary Morris J. Tobin of Labor of the United States of America. Thank you, Mr. President. President Randolph, Mr. Joseph Keenan, the head of Labor's League for Political Education, officers and delegates to this 25th convention, or the rather the silver anniversary convention of the founding of the Brotherhood of the President. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Officer TM P dessas in a dual capacity. First as Secretary of Labor, but in a more important respect as the personal representative of the President of the United States, Harry S. Truman. And I have here a personal letter from President Truman to President Randolph, which I would like to read aloud, Mr. President, with your permission, to the delegates at the convention. It reads, the White House, Washington, August 22, 1950. Dear Mr. Randolph, I have great pleasure in extending warm felicitations and hearty congratulations to the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, American Federation of Labor, on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee Convention. Once again, those who cherish freedom and individual dignity are involved in a great struggle for the minds, hearts, and loyalties of millions of human beings all over the world. In this struggle, America's Negroes are destined to play an ever more historic role. All America is proud of the valorous performance of our Negro fighters in Korea. Their courage, skill, and high morale will give new impetus to the measures we have undertaken to ensure that America's armed forces will be the most democratic in the world. Their achievements on the battlefield indicate the more important role which American Negroes are destined to play in our new program to help the long-oppressed peoples of Asia and Africa help themselves toward freedom, dignity, and self-government. I am especially grateful for your organization's continued support and encouragement in the achievement of effective civil rights legislation, which I still regard as one of the major pieces of unfinished business before the Congress of the United States. With best wishes for a successful convention which will launch your organization on its second quarter century of progress, I am very sincerely yours, Harry S. Truman, President of the United States. I am delighted to join you in the celebration of your silver jubilee. There are younger unions which have done well, but none of them has had to face the roadblocks which stood in your way. None of these, none of them, have had to overcome the peculiar handicaps over which your organization has already triumphed. You have had to fight not merely hostile management, you have had to fight a hostile world. As though such odds were not enough to contend with, you have had to deal with civility and fear within your ranks and supplant them with the self-respect and courage without which freedom is an empty word. That you have won through in spite of these handicaps, that from being rejected men on the fringe of labor you have become the equal of any labor organization in the land is proof not merely of the rightness of your cause, but of the quality of the leadership which your organization has enjoyed. And as you have developed here, they can make great and high democratic living standards for themselves with the help and the contribution of American know-how and that is point four, simply that and nothing more. Today, our top military leaders have given public expression to the great courage that has been demonstrated by our fighting boys of Negro blood. They have stated that they have been the equal equal of any fighting group in the whole of the Korean campaign. They have held the line when they were told to hold. They have advanced when they were ordered to advance. And they have been a great credit to every man and woman present in this room and a great credit to every one of the 150 million Americans that go to make up this great republic. So, President Truman five years ago, with a recognition of the aggressive intentions of communism, started first with Turkey and with Greece. And when a vacuum was created in Greece, when the British had pulled out, President Truman ordered 500 of the best minds of the best minds of the American army to go in there to build back a strength on the part of the military of Greece to defend that country from the aggression of the Balkan communistic satellites that bought of the country. At the same time, he gave to Turkey economic and military aid and a know-how to rebuild their industry, to rebuild their roads and to rebuild their railroads. Until today, Turkey stands as a bastion of defense for free, freedom and for democracy. Because within the year there was a complete turnover of government, brought about in a democratic way, but there wasn't the slightest recession from the determined intentions of the people of Turkey to preserve Turkey for the Turks and to withstand any communistic aggression from over their borders. Then came the day when the President had an opportunity to repay all that we owe Western Europe. And this country owes a great obligation to Italy. All you have to do is just take a look at the roster of any battlest and you will always find, if it's five or six or ten, one or more boys of Italian descent. And with courage he sent into Italy. The food that was necessary to build back a confidence in these people whose economy had been ravaged as a result of five years of war. And today, Italy stands as a much stronger democracy than it was five years ago. But the job is only partly done. And I am confident that Italy's strength will be built back, a haven and an opportunity to build back. And it will be given and an opportunity will be given for the overpopulation of that country to find peaceful living in some other part of the world so that those left within that peninsula will not exceed the numbers that can be economically supported. The Marshall Plan has built back the Marshall Plan. The Marshall Plan has built back the economies of these countries, but more has to be done. The North Atlantic Compact gave them the confidence to build together in a military way. And now, the military implementation of that program is rapidly on its way. Not for a war of aggression, but for the purpose of preserving the free world with the hope that eventually, under good common sense, there will be an extension of democracy, an extension of the recognition of the human dignity of every human being in the world, not only on this side of the Iron Curtain, but in a peaceful manner for every quarter of the globe. The kind of philosophy that recognizes that these rights are not given by any government. They are not dictated by any individual. They are innate rights that come to every human being from a supreme power God Almighty. And under that recognition, all working together in a democratic way, the kind of democratic way that has built your organization in a quarter of a century, from six members to a point at today, I think you have 99% of the street and car porters of America, members of your organization, built in a democratic way, with the help of your government, through the inaccessible of the Wagner Act, a law that bears the name of one of the greatest United States senators that ever served in that great body, and formerly the senior senator from this state. A law that protected your right to organize and enabled you to make a real contribution to the soundness of America's private enterprise system. As representatives and citizens of this republic. As representatives and citizens of this republic. As representatives and citizens of this republic. We have heard the address of the Honorable Maurice J. Tobin, Secretary of Labor, before the seventh biennial convention and the 25th anniversary of the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Clow Porters. He was introduced by their president, Mr. A. Philip Randolph. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System. Republican
