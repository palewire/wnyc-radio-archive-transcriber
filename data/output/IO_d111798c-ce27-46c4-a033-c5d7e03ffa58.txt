Radio's microphones are now in the ballroom of the Hotel New Yorker at 34th Street and 8th Avenue, and the occasion is the 15th Annual Conference of the Associated Police Communications Officers in the Hotel New Yorker. And our chairman is now ready, Mr. Vincent Doyle, who will act as chairman and introduce the mayor in the regular auto program. Commissioner Doyle. Well, the 15th Annual Conference of the Associated Police Communications Officers comes to order. I believe we should start with our national anthem. Oh, say can you sing by the long, very light What so proudly we hailed as the twilight's last gleaming What was bright and bright starved through the perilous fight For the rampant we watched was so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare Of the bursting in air It drove through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled Can I yet swear For the rampant we watched And the home Of the brave For the rampant we watched I hope Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I believe that the best thing we can do right now is to inform some of our guests of the purpose of this organization. And review for those who do know our real purpose. So I'll read from our bulletin the following. We are organized to foster the development and progress of the art of police communication and intercommunication. Upon the North American continent. To the end of the safety of human lives, the protection of property, and the general welfare of all peoples concerned may be benefited to the highest degree. To aid and assist in the development of channels, methods, systems, and all other media for the rapid and accurate collection, exchange, and dissemination of information relating to crime and criminals. Emergencies and other vitally important information of police and emergency nature. To further by active effort and example the cooperation among and between this corporation and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. The Interstate Commission on Crime, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Secret Service as well as the Federal Communications Commission. They are our purposes. They are our purposes. I would like to, at this time, present to you our host. The gentleman who makes this conference possible here in this great city of New York. I'll ask Deputy Chief Inspector Francis Burns to carry on from here. Mr. President, Mayor O'Dwyer, Commissioner O'Brien, Chief Raylan, and Reverend Montaigne, Drack. I would like to welcome you up here tonight, therefore, to bring you up for a St. Gordon. And I through the most mayoría of thearch exposures of my presentation in the Fusion Army. Secondly, regardless of the name of종ies, and Davis Police Minister's enslaved by the Secre they will 기� рублей to the structure. He all won't invite others to impart a significantому agent back at some push in the pastatickt. If you're not aware of Moves, please join. Gratitude will beき 배appy. Every year in Arcane, there'll be a great deal. It'll be great. The fact is that the mayor of the City of New York and the Police Commissioner of the City New York are two of the busiest men in this program. And a great deal with the people here this morning and to takeран your quality of these actions and best practices. There'll be your&be atrás in many of us to do. time out to come here and welcome you this morning in spite of nothing. And we deeply appreciate it. I now have the great honor of presenting to you a former member of our department and a man who everybody in this city has the greatest admiration and love for, Mayor William O'Dowire. Thank you. Chief Burns, Mr. President of the Senior Bracken, Commissioner O'Brien and distinguished visitors to our city and honored us by this 50th annual conference of an association devoted to the improvement of police communications. I have had an opportunity in the past four years to do just what I'm doing here this morning, that is to welcome visitors who honor us by coming here to Halle Conventions in our city. I've had occasion from time to time to have high compliments paid for me by some of our own boys in the police department. And I think in Frank Burns, he told you this morning that the job of being mayor and the job of being police commissioner one of the two hardest in the whole world, he was possibly right that raises this question. At one time, I thought the job of being police commissioner was the heart of the two. I told that to Arthur Wallander, the former police commissioner one time. But six months ago, we had a banquet in honor of Arthur Wallander over in another hotel. And there I noticed that we had six ex-police commissioners actually alive and going strong, and all sitting around enjoying themselves and engaged in productive activities. And the thought occurred to me that we didn't have one single ex-mayor who had spent a full time in city hall alive in the city. I mentioned it then and I mentioned it now, so that we get the record straight, maybe there is a question. Ladies and gentlemen, from out of town and out of the state especially, I give you the heartiest welcome that I can give. Thank you. Thank you. 32 years since Commissioner O'Brien and Bill Whalen and some of the other boys on this stage and myself were rookie policemen in this city. At that time, if you were in trouble, you had an opportunity to wrap your nightstick three times on the sidewalk in the hall that your side partner a mile away might hear it. And that was communications when we were rookie cops. Or you blew your whistle. Or you made some outcry that if a crime was being committed within your sight and you were single-handedly unable to cope with it, you gave an alarm to the perpetrators by the very outcry. So that in this modern world, the business of taking advantage of improvement of communications within, not only the community within the precincts, within the neighborhoods, within the city, within the state, within the nation, becomes of the utmost importance in the preservation of life and the protection of property, which are the basic purposes of the police department. Now comes an opportunity here to see what has been provided to us by the great engineers and chemists who have gone into the field of communication, not particularly for police purposes, but have come up with ideas that are of inescalable value to those who are charged by their communities with the preservation of the peace, of course, in the long run. We can grow back in our nation only a few short years. I welcome from Texas and from the Southwest and from California, those men and women who have come from the extreme corners of the country to this convention. I welcome them as it were only to say that when the founding fathers, depending upon rivers, boatmen, and long halls over mountains, over plains, when they depended on the primitive communications of the early days from our Constitutionist founders, little do they think that thanks to improved communications, every town and village in the United States today is almost as close as the suburbs used to be to our cities. Little do they think that we could take an airplane right here in New York, on the coast, from all the way to 10 or 11 hours of climbing time to the after. There, why Bret Hart's stories, the Sandy Bar, the Tennessee Platinum, written in the valleys of California to the land here to the east for seven or eight months after they had been written. Months and years to make the grades. Seventy-five, eighty years ago, as late as that. To go a hundred years ago, sure. To go all the way to the coast. They said that the college never started at all. And the most rugged, they were the only ones who could make it. And today, we have a comfortable and luxurious faculty. We have television almost completely covering the United States. We have the telephone. We have the radio, which transmits our messages in matters of seconds. So that, uh, physical transportation includes communications through that medium. With, uh, all the others, the telegraph, the post office, every other method brought up to date. It's only to visit people. That the police of our nation would get together and recognize that we're no longer strangers. We're no longer independent of one another in many fields. New York City calling in to feed its eight million people about 22,500 tons of food a day to feed eight million people is absolutely dependent upon outside of the city. You, on the other hand, you have things that we goodbye from us. We are no longer just separate communities. We are today throughout our nation. Principally due to these improved communications and practices, we are actually neighbors, no matter what part of the country we're in. So that, when we think of looking at the criminal, who came here, and he's gone away, that he's let go, and find exactly what is available to our police departments in the methods of communication and in the methods of transportation. We know that in the handling of that problem, that constant warfare that our police in every part of the country are engaged in against the organized criminal, we know that if we are not prepared to take advantage of every single gift that comes from the laboratories, that comes from the chemists, from the engineers, that comes from the inventors, in the line of communication, we, our efficiency has been lessened by that degree. And, I recently had a day and a half in Mexico City. And, I had to come back. That is the first time I had come back. For the same reason, I had a strike started up somewhere around town. And, in those two days, the thing that did not escape me was there in Mexico City, police department is equipped with the walkie-talkie principal, two-wear razor. Beautifully equipped. Good equipment, men trained, in communication with every part of the city, day and night. I was delighted to see that. Because, from now on, with again these improved communications, we have to be prepared to reach out beyond the boundaries of our own nation. The day is quickly coming when we have to expand this convention to include an entire hemisphere if we are going to meet the requirements. And that are our obligations in the field of preservation of life and the protection of property. That constant war against organized crime. Presently, ladies and gentlemen, this morning, I have the honor, as the mayor of the city, to welcome you with the full appreciation of the serious questions that are going to be yours for consultation, conscience, and the decisions to be made. I shall personally look with a great deal of interest and read the reports of this conference. You have my personal assurance that anything we can do to make your visit here not only constructive and of mutual benefit, but enjoyable, we shall be most happy to be at your service. We hope that when Thursday comes around and these programs have been completed, that you will have had an opportunity to look at a city of eight million people and look at how our people have to live, housed in a small area of 365 square miles, the greatest concentration of people in the world. Think of the penalties you have to pay for living in New York City. Think of the penalties you have to pay for living in New York City. Go back to your beautiful cities and towns and look at God's blue sky. Look and breathe the fresh air. Think of the millions all during the hot summer, crowded in their small spaces. Think of the millions all during the hot summer, crowded in their small spaces. You have to pay for living in New York City. Go back to your beautiful cities and towns and look at God's blue sky. Look and breathe the fresh air. Think of the millions all during the hot summer, crowded in their small spaces. And bring with you a little thought that those of us in governments, no matter what phase that we're in, we have a constant obligation to those who look to the people of the world. . Or that any insane to those of us in government are in New York City. during the hot summer, crowded in their small spaces. And bring with you a little thought that those of us in government, no matter what space that we're in, we have a constant obligation to those who look to government for the only physical help that they can get. It might be playgrounds for the children. It might be better schools. It might be health centers, so that everyone will get a break and help have a place to go to for advice. It might be better housing. It might be programs of slum clearance. It might be the purification of our waters, where sewage pours in. Something that we have to approach definitely, and we have approached it here, to the tune of about 98 million, so that our beaches and the hot weather can be available without fear, to the children of the lower income brackets, especially who are dependent upon that. Look at us with, not as we have been represented to you as a boastful city, talking about our wealth and our big institutions, but look at us as 5 million people out of our 80, who are living in quarters for which they pay less than $50 a month rent. These are the people that, in the main, through direct taxation and indirect taxation, actually contribute much more than half of the expense of running this city for one year, which, to give the kind of services that I'm talking about, down to and including the desperately sick in our public hospitals, that actually cough up, dig deeply in and cough up, $1,200,000,000 to run the city for a year, with a manpower of about 165,000 people working for it. It's a big undertaking. It has, of course, occasionally its Kiss Me Cake, and its South Pacific, and it has a few other pleasantries, but for 365 days it's a pretty grim proposition of not only making a living, but seeing to it that the health and the happiness of those you love are protected and preserved. Go back to your hometowns when you leave, thinking of that, will you, please? And you'll have a kindlier feeling to us. We want you to like us. We want you to come so that we can tell you we like you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mayor O'Dwyer. President Doyle has just thanked the mayor in a few simple words for the splendid address, which he gave here at the Hotel New Yorker, on the occasion of the 15th Annual Conference of the Associated Police Communication Officers, in session here at this time, stressing as it does the importance of communications and the unity of police work in the protection of life and property in a great and wondrous city like New York. We had the privilege of presenting the guest president, Mr. Vincent, President Vincent Doyle, and then he very courteously turned the microphone over to Deputy Chief Inspector Francis A. Byrne, of our own telegraph bureau and police headquarters, who made the local introductions. The Police Glee Club of the City of New York, under the direction of Eddie Dillon, gave a most splendid concert previous to the broadcast, and in solo and ensemble work entertained the guests here in the Hotel New Yorker.
