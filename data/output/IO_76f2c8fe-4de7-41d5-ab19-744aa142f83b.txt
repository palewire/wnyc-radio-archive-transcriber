The Municipal Broadcasting System presents Freedom's Ladder Freedom's Ladder with radio star Monica Lewis, piano favorite Melba Pope, and your genial master of ceremonies, the Amsterdam news columnist Bill Chase. How do you do? Greetings, salutations, a fun cheerio, and welcome once more to Freedom's Ladder, which is just an intimate program of music, a bit of chit-chat, and this and that, just to remind you that freedom is more than a mere word. The curtain rises now, and our cheerful little earful, and here is our own little teeny-weeny, lovable Melba Pope, of whom there is no humor on the 88, and the number is Embraceable You. The Amen Stat солi The End The End The End The End The End The End Oh, of course, I see, no wonder. It's that lovely young star from W.R. Mutual, Monica Lewis. And Monica's going to sing for you now, Give Me Five Minutes More. Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more. Let me stay, let me stay in your arms. Here am I begging for only five minutes more. Only five minutes more. Let me stay, let me stay in your arms. Oh, Monica, now that you've mentioned it, I think we could use more than five minutes more of your singing. But now that we're here, that's all right. Monica, we'd like to talk about some nice things, and I can't think of a nicer person to talk about. Well, thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. Well, thank you. I was playing at a Broadway show that flopped. What a shame. And what show was that? Johnny Two by Four. Oh, yeah. Well, the only claim to fame that has is that Lauren Bacall was an extra in it. Was she? Yeah. And besides that, I've done a few personal appearances. The most recent is my appearance at the Blue Angel. Oh, that one you know about. I just completed, yeah, about ten weeks then. You had a wonderful long run there. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, do you like nightclub work as compared to radio? Well, I like nightclub work, but for a short period of time, I don't like extended engagements. It's pretty tough when you have to do three and four. But I do, yeah. I do like extended engagements in radio. I don't blame you. Well, of course, now, you've got a wonderful show. I don't know just how much dough you get as compared to the dough we get here, which is practically nil. Well, I don't know. I've done fairly well, I should say, as far as radio is concerned. I hope to do much better. I was on the Chesterfield show for 39 weeks, and that was a nice run. Mm-hmm. Now, tell me, in your formula, do you have any set practice of big names, or do you use talent if it's unusual talent? Well, my program's only been on six or seven weeks, and for the first few weeks, we have tried to stick to names, if possible. I don't say just the biggest names. I mean, we've used up-and-coming artists like Bobby Doyle. That's right. I remember. And Bobby is a signature artist. He records on Signature. I record for Signature, too. Good. Why not put in a plug? It's free. So, we use Bobby, and, of course, he did have his own show for a while for Evershot. But, I mean, compared to names like Lionel Hampton, Stan Kenton, Bobby's a newcomer. He's a youngster. Wonderful. Why don't you have this new guy on, Mel Tomei? I've heard an awful lot about him. Mm-hmm. Yes, well, yes, he's a very good singer. We, as a matter of fact, I was at a celebrity party thrown for him by Art Ford on the Milkman's matinee. Oh, great. Yes, I heard about that one. Yes, it was a lot of fun. Well, I think you've got a wonderful future in radio, and not only that, but I think you could do very well on the stage, in a musical comedy, perhaps. Well, thank you. I hope to do something on Broadway. Well, I've been hoping for a long time, but I haven't had the time or the energy to get around to really doing much about it. Well, you will. And the movies, how about that? You'd be wonderful in the movies. Why, thank you. You should see her. She's very cute, very petite, very blonde, very charming. Gee, you've got everything that's going to stop you. Well, I like to do movies, too, but, I mean, it takes a long time, unless you just want to be a flash-in-the-pan artist. I mean, I'd rather establish myself first as a good singer, and that takes a long time. Yes, but you don't want to wait too long before you get too old. Well, really, I don't have that to worry about yet, Jack. Let's face it. Well, would you like to tell us how old you are? Is it a secret? Well, the truth of the matter is I'm 21, but we say I'm 20. Wonderful. A Mere Babe in the Woods. Well, do you think we might have another number now, because we've got lots of time, and I think the people would like to hear you some time. Fine. Okay, sure. What will it be this time? This one's a sort of a sultry ballad, I'm in the Mood for Love. Oh, well, now that's, you've got something there. I'm in the Mood for Love. Thank you very much. I'm in the Mood for Love Simply because you're near me Funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, but when you're near me I'm in the Mood for Love Heaven is in your eyes Bright as the stars were under So, is it any wonder So, is it any wonder I'm in the Mood for Love Why stop to think of weather Why stop to think of weather Our little dream might fade We'll put our hearts together No, we are one I'm not afraid If there's a cloud up above If it should rain Well, let it But for tonight Forget it I'm in the Mood for Love Oh, thank you very much, Monica. And the way you sang that, I really believe that. That's right. You didn't tell us anything about your husband, and I have heard that you're married, right? Tell us something about him. Tell us something about him. Well, I'm married a little over a year to a young chap named Bob Thiel. Everybody's young these days but me. Why? Aren't you young? You look young. No more. Well, Bob is the youngest president, I would say, of a record company in the country. He's 24. 24 and president of a record company? Yeah. Not signature records. Yes, signature. Thank you for getting me a job. Well, I don't know. I don't have much pull around there. I really don't. All I do is work. Well, that's wonderful. You look so radiant today. Do you perhaps have one little reason for that gleam in your eye and whatnot? Well, yes, I really have. After a year of living from pillar to post and in and out of every hotel in town, we finally found an apartment. And it's such a pleasure to walk from one room to another. Oh, that is swell. I know exactly how you feel. Because the only apartment I've had in the last three years was in the army. Oh, great. And I had to share it with something like 59 other guys. Well, Monica, it's been awfully nice having you down today. Well, thank you, Joe. And if you're not too busy, we'd like to have you back again very soon. Well, I certainly hope to come back soon. Thank you an awful lot. Well, back to Melba Pope now, who is willing and ready and able again. I think I've used that expression before, that old cliche. Well, anywho, Melba's going to play for us now these foolish things, and I'm sure she doesn't have me in mind. Well, time is fast. Well, time is fast running out. And so we must say good night to you one and all.
