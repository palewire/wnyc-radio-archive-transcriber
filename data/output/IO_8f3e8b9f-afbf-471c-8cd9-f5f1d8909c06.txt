We say that right in the middle of our explanation why the radio came in and we're down here at Idlewild, New York's international airport, where a great company is assembled to combine Richmond, Brooklyn, Army and Youth Day. Just a few moments ago, a young Master DeVito took off in a helicopter and was carried over to a Scandinavian plane that will take him on a goodwill trip to Europe. And the poise of this youngster, he didn't seem to be much more than 10 or 12 years old. He was speeded on his way by Borough President Hall of Richmond. And just as the helicopter left with the youth on his way to carry the message of youth to Europe, why the other helicopter of the Navy, the Sikorsky, has just landed and Borough President Cashmore is standing at attention, receiving the salute of guns as they are taking off here with all the formalities of a great day at Idlewild. Borough President Hall has gone down to greet him and these two great boroughs of Richmond and Kings, to be more exact, but more affectionately Brooklyn, are holding forth here today in the formalities. Now there's still a few moments, the guns are still going and the President can't move while the prodigal prevails. But as soon as it's concluded, why he and Borough President Hall will come back to the speaker's stand. We'll have music by the department of, the police department rather, band and glee club. And when the time comes for the anthem, with distinguished artist singing as well, Marjorie Fabregas, and then the regular order of program, the formalities of these two Brooklyn, these two boroughs rather, we're not entirely all Brooklyn, just part. And the Borough of Kings, more affectionately as I said Brooklyn, will take over. And the guns are still going off and the Borough President has to stand there until all the prodigal formalities are finished. We're having a lot of fun here at Idlewild. We're demonstrating the facility of aviation with the calmness and ease with which this Sikorsky, Navy Sikorsky, dropped here on the ground right in front of the speaker's stand on a space that is not much bigger than the ordinary extension roof of a private dwelling. We conducted that fine exhibition of communications and their facilities from the Herald Tribune plane a little previous to that. And the air factors of the show here today have been very interesting. And if that gun ever stops firing, we'll have some other kind of a program as well. And now, Groveray Whalen has conducted his guests here to the stand, and it'll only be a few moments now while felicitations and greetings are going on here at the speaker's stand before we present Mr. Whalen. This wonderful air show here today at Idlewild and every day this week, despite prevailing ceilings, why, they've put on wonderful demonstrations. Those jet planes, despite low ceilings, they've done some very remarkable flying, breathtaking flying, in fact. And then we've had all the dramatization of Coast Guard rescue work with the various types of helicopters. In fact, every way that aviation may be adapted to the present-day situation, why we've had that demonstration. Our host, Mr. Whalen, is very anxious that the police department make arrangements for the public to come in and occupy the seats here in the boxes and reserve sections here. He wants everybody to sit down and take a seat, and he knows that the police department, in their own smiling, efficient way, will manage this and permit the people to occupy these seats here. Mr. Whalen requests that his guests be seated so that they may enjoy this program here today. What do you want, Eddie? Yeah. Well, just to show you that the police department is always alerted, Eddie Dillinger now tells me that they're ready to give us some music before we start the regular formalities because all the neighbors from Brooklyn and Richmond are shaking hands and saying hello. So we'll listen now to the police glee club while they consistently sing Jubilee. Thank you. Thank you. The THE We're thankful for the many blessings that we've got Our congratulations to To the hope I furrows through So I know that we are proud to be At the Golden Jubilee of the City of New York It's the Golden Jubilee Of the City of New York Everywhere you go you hear the folks all say That New York's the greatest city in the world today Our congratulations indeed Makes no difference what you're free So I know that we are proud to be At the Golden Jubilee of the City of New York N-E-W-Y-O-R-K New York!

Almighty God, grant that we are here today not to strut, not to preen our feathers of possession and power, but that we are here to dedicate the field to the service of mankind and grant that every plane that leaves this field and every plane that arrives may be a messenger of goodwill among men and nations everywhere. Amen. Thank you, Dr. Greenway. Grover Whalen, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen, as your presiding officer, I want to welcome you here this afternoon. We are going to see a thrilling air show by the world's greatest pilots. Before the show goes on, we are having only a brief program of ceremonies. Personally, I've just had a thrilling time of my own. Only a few minutes ago, I was getting into a Navy helicopter at Floyd Bennett Field over in Brooklyn. In less time than it takes to say New York International Airport, we were crossing Jamaica Bay. And only a few moments ago, the helicopter landed us just a few feet from here. So I feel more than qualified to pilot our program here this afternoon. At the outset, let me congratulate Mayor O'Dwyer and Grover Whalen. Both have worked hard for this golden anniversary air show. Despite some bad weather, it has been a success. So I say congratulations to Mayor O'Dwyer and to you, Grover Whalen, the world's greatest showman since Barnum. And I offer my sincere congratulations congratulations. And Grover, for the late comers, won't you just stand up and let everyone here see the greatest showman that we've ever had in this world. Ladies and gentlemen, let's give Grover Whalen a big hand. Now my own duties here are going to be very brief. All of you know the presiding officer's job is not to make a speech. I am leaving this to the prominent speakers you'll be hearing in a few minutes. I do want to say, very briefly, this great airport is going to mean much to Brooklyn. It's only one eight and one half miles from Borough Hall. That's a fairly short drive by car. But only a few minutes ago, I think I proved this. Brooklyn and Idlewild are really next-door neighbors. They are no more than a few minutes flying time apart. That's how close they'll be in the near future. When flying becomes as commonplace as riding in our subways or taking a trip by automobile. Our program this afternoon is really a four-in-one ceremony. Last Tuesday was supposed to be Brooklyn Day. But you and I know what happened. We were rained out. So Brooklyn and Army Day is being combined now with Richmond and Youth Day. Brooklyn is proud to share this day with Richmond. We are on it also by sharing the day with the Army and the youngsters of our city. And now let's get on with the program. I'm honored to have the borough president of Richmond as the next speaker. And I want to say to all Richmondites one thing. You may be small in size, but you are represented in our board of estimate by a man who knows how to act with grace and humility on certain occasions. And when force and eloquence is needed to put over what is necessary for Richmond, there is no greater representative in the board of estimate than my side partner, the Honorable Cornelius Hall, the president of the borough of Richmond. Connie? Mr. Chairman, Reverend clergy, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. First, I deeply appreciate the felicitations of my friend John Cashmore. The people of Richmond Borough whom I have the honor to represent are proud to be part of the great city of New York. And we are extremely happy to join with the borough of Brooklyn in the ceremonies today. I bring felicitations from Richmond to his honor, Mayor O'Dwyer, who has done so much for us during the past two and one half years. And to Grover Whalen and to the members of his staff and to the least of those volunteers who are working with him to fittingly celebrate the golden anniversary of the greatest city in the world, our own New York. We do also wish the members of the Port of New York Authority every success in operating this airport. We are confident that under their able guidance, Idlewild will be recognized throughout the world as the best airport and the gateway to the world. I bring felicitations to Jim Burke, borough president of Queens, and to his staff for all they did to make this airport possible. Last but not least, I want to say that I am happy to share honors today with a friend of many years, John Cashmore of Brooklyn, borough president and Democratic leader. We in Richmond feel very close to the people of Brooklyn, and we are looking forward to the day when we will be connected by a physical link. Time does not permit me to say any more, so I will close by wishing everybody witness this air show and all the participants in it an enjoyable day. Thank you. Thank you, Connor. We regret General Courtney Hodges is unable to be with us today. He had a speech ready for our Brooklyn Army Day program last Tuesday. Because of the rain, the whole program was postponed. Today, the War Department has a special assignment of its own for General Hodges. So he is represented by Major General Roscoe B. Woodruff, Deputy Army Commander. General Woodruff, won't you please stand up and take a bow? General Woodruff. You and I know that there's only one band in the city of New York. So without further ado, let's hear from the Police Department band in a musical salute to the United States Army. which one is this? This us? All right, stand on the side. This us? Don't let's hear from the police. Come on. The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Thank you. The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Stout-hearted men who will fight for the right they adore. Start me with ten who are stout-hearted men, and I'll soon give you ten thousand more. Oh, shoulder to shoulder, and bolder and bolder, they go as they go to the fore. Then there's nothing in the world can halt on our plan. When stout-hearted men can stick together man to man. Give me some men who are stout-hearted men who will fight for the right they adore. Start me with ten who are stout-hearted men, and I'll soon give you ten thousand more. Oh, shoulder to shoulder, and bolder and bolder, they go as they go to the fore. Then there's nothing in the world can halt on our plan. When sound-hearted men can stick together man to man. Thank you very much. Thank you. The Reverend Frederick P. Gehring of St. John's University of Brooklyn will offer a prayer. Father Gehring. In the name of the Father, and now of the Son, and now of the Holy Ghost. Amen. O Heavenly Father, whose almighty power reaches from end to end, and who ordereth all things well, make this international airport an instrument for the accomplishment of thy divine design. Bless the beacons. They may flash their rays of hope to anxious pilots. Make fruitful the mission of those who depart from this field in search for harmony and peace. Sanctify the souls of those who fly to this land, so that they may share in that peace which thou alone can give through Christ our Lord. Amen. Amen. Thank you, Father Gehring. In Brooklyn, we have a newspaper that is more than 100 years old. It's the Brooklyn Eagle. During World War II, its publisher crossed the Pacific by plane. He saw the war areas where air power counted so much. I present to you, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Frank D. Schroth, publisher of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. John Cashmore. Distinguished guests. Ladies and gentlemen. Since the dedication of the New York International Airport last Saturday, the President of the United States laid emphasis on the value to the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy, on the planes that have been developed since the World War, and which can use the airport, upon the destructors of these planes, and in general, upon the military might, that it is hope will keep our country at peace. The President referred to the New York International Airport as a symbol of peace, and at the same time as a most powerful implement for obtaining and keeping the peace. The Mayor gave us his view that a full appreciation of what the International Airport means to this community will come with the years. Today has been set aside as Brooklyn Day and Richmond Day. Our brother thus has an opportunity to show its great interest in air transportation. We accept with satisfaction the estimates of the military usefulness of the world's greatest airfield, and we have complete realization of the part that it will play in the development of the Army, Navy, and Air Forces. But it is to air transportation as a major tool in Brooklyn's daily commercial life that we wish to address ourselves. Brooklyn is the fourth city in volume of retail trade in the country. It is the seventh in total industrial production. Just recently, the Brooklyn Eagle had occasion to survey the air possibilities for Burra industry. This fact-finding study demonstrated the need for improved airline service for the heavy Brooklyn air traffic and led to the establishment of the consolidated air services directly from the Burra. It is interesting to observe what this survey of the status of commercial aviation in Brooklyn developed. It showed that in hundreds of persons an industry queried, two out of every three indicated that they use the airlines regularly for business purposes. One out of every three industrial firms has a travel plan or a transportation charge account. One out of every three uses air cargo in one form or another. These facts, however, are not surprising when you consider that over 50% of the freight that clears out of the port of New York is shipped from Brooklyn piers. And within the next 45 days, 750 freighters will clear from Brooklyn ports. Much of the cargo that clears through Brooklyn docks is initiated by Brooklyn industry. There are 308 concerns in the Burra actively engaged in importing and exporting. The possibilities of developing airline travel, originating or terminating in the Burra, are shown when it is realized, as the Burra president said, that the international airport is just eight and a half miles from the Burra Hall, probably a shorter distance than any other bus or airline terminal in the city. There is practically no limitation to the possible growth of Brooklyn passenger and commercial air travel. The people of no community will have a greater sense of air travel consciousness. Industry, as well as individuals, will come to realize the proximity of this airport to the very center of the Burra. We at Brooklyn are happy to take part in the dedication of the airport and in celebrating the 50th anniversary of Greater New York. We pledge our Burra to its full power in making this the greatest airfield in the world. Thank you, Mr. Shroth. As we close our ceremonies, Rabbi Joseph Klein of Temple Beth Emmeth will offer the benediction. Rabbi Klein. Our God and Father, we thank Thee for this privilege that is given to us to celebrate the opening of this great airfield. We pray, O Lord, that Thou wilt always pour forth Thy benediction upon this airport, giving Thy safety and protection to the ships that fly in the air and find a safe refuge on this field. We ask, O God, that every airship which leaves this field or enters onto it may be a harbinger of peace and a messenger of good hidings. May this great international airfield be a bond of union between our nation and all the nations of the earth, furthering the causes of commerce, trade, but above all, of peace. Amen. Thank you, Rabbi Klein. And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you will watch within two minutes or less, you will say and see the fastest jet planes in the world. And up until the time they arrive, I'm asking the police department band if they won't be good enough to take over. Here you are now! And now aviation has taken over and here at Idlewild, New York's international airport, the jets have just roared by so fast that everyone had to look quicker they wouldn't even have seen them. These marvelous demonstrations are part of the great air show here and two days remain, Saturday and Sunday, for you, New Yorkers, and all in the adjacent states and territory to come to Idlewild and enjoy one of the greatest spectacles ever organized anywhere in the world. Come out here and get the sunshine, the vitamin D, and the wonderful experience of this vast field and the wonderful air shows that are part of every day's program here at Idlewild Airport. From now on, for the balance of the weekend, remember your song and anthem is come out to Idlewild. Just a moment. Come on. Come on. Come on. There are 20 convalescent veterans present from Veterans Hospital at Northport, Long Island. And Mr. Whalen, the borough presidents of Brooklyn and Richmond salute the veterans and all veterans everywhere in the person of these 20 veterans here today. And as the jets roar over, we take leave of you from Idlewild Airport and return you to the studios in the municipal building while the Army takes over for an explanation to the audience here of the air show that is in the air at this moment. This is the municipal broadcasting system.
