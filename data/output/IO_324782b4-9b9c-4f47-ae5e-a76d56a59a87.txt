Over the Back Fence, a program of clippings and comment from the newspapers of our northern neighbor. Each week, a Canadian journalist and radio commentator will sample Canadian opinion on topics of concern and interest to the United States and Canada. The program is prepared by the International Service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and is distributed by the National Association of Educational Broadcasters. This week's commentator is Wilson Woodside, foreign editor of Saturday Night, one of Canada's leading journals of opinion. Now, over the back fence, here is Wilson Woodside. Thank you, Mr. Palaf. No people except the Americans themselves could have been so closely interested or concerned in the change of U.S. administrations as were the Canadians. After all, it was taking place just over the back fence. So Canadians listened to Mr. Truman's farewell fireside talk, and they listened to, and some watched on TV, the inauguration of General Eisenhower. And they read a great deal about these historic events in their editorial pages. In the Canadian capital, the Ottawa citizen recognizes that President Truman was held in higher regard in most other countries than in his own, where he had antagonized many of his fellow countrymen. The paper admits that. His blunders were numerous, especially in the field of domestic politics, where his political experience might have suggested smoother relations with Congress. But on the international scene, where, curiously enough, he was completely inexperienced, Mr. Truman's record is outstanding. In Toronto, the Globe and Mail sees the most conspicuous quality of the outgoing president as his courage, and gives three notable instances of this. The decision he had to take to first use the atom bomb against Japan, the decision to intervene in Korea, and the firing of General MacArthur to check the spreading of the Korean War. The Globe sums it up this way. Mr. Truman has been in charge of American policy throughout the atomic age and the Cold War to date. He fought hard for peace, and in so doing, led his country into foreign policies and commitments without parallel in American peacetime history. As to his conduct of home policy, the American public gave their verdict when they elected General Eisenhower. Mr. Truman's government of by crony was perhaps his chief failure. The Toronto Star, too, notes that Mr. Truman, thrust into office by fate, proved himself capable in big things, but not so sure in the handling of innumerable small matters which bulk large in day-to-day government. The Winnipeg Free Press, out on the prairies, in an editorial called Mr. Truman's Legacy, ticks off these big things, some of the largest decisions of the present era, which Truman took with supreme courage. It lists them as the Truman Doctrine, which saved Greece and barred the gates of the Mediterranean to communism, the Marshall Plan, which revived Europe and probably saved it from chaos, the North Atlantic Treaty, which united the West in a moment of desperate danger, the defense of Korea, which for the first time united peace-loving states in collective security. These are all the work of Mr. Truman's government. This thoughtful paper sees the best demonstration of the validity of these Truman policies in the lack of any indication that General Eisenhower intends to abandon them. Indeed, it finds in them the only course which the United States and its allies can safely follow. The foundation of foreign policy laid down by Mr. Truman when the struggle with Russia began was so well and truly laid that not one essential stone can be removed. That is the measure of Mr. Truman as an international statesman, often underestimated by his mistakes as a domestic statesman. Jumping back east again to the province of Quebec, the Montreal Star takes an almost entirely uncritical view. Truman was a good and very courageous president. Though he rode into public life on the coattails of corrupt Missouri politicians, he kept himself clean in the doing. If he sometimes lost his temper and taste, that is of little matter. In the pinches, he was worth his weight in jewels. The paper goes on. His judgments have been swift and good, made with moral understanding and carried out with resolution. He was the single greatest architect of united action by the free world in all the post-war years. Canadians from coast to coast are grateful to him. A more incisive view comes from the Edmonton Journal out in the Alberta oil country. The journal concedes that Truman has been one of the most criticized presidents in American history. But he thinks that his critics ignore his great difficulties. After all, Truman inherited a weak and divided cabinet, a split party, and a hostile Congress. He inherited also an unsound foreign policy based on a complete misreading of the post-war world. And he suffered an unparalleled amount of treachery and betrayal among his advisors and subordinates. The Edmonton paper thinks it remarkable that out of this wreckage, Truman was able to organize an effective administration with many remarkable achievements to its credit. Summing up, it says... He will be remembered as the president who finally broke with the tradition of American isolationism. By bold and resolute action, at critical moments, he saved Western Europe and much of the Far East from conquest by the Soviets. There is a story of a music critic, not the one in Washington who received the famous note from HST, who said of Mendelssohn that alongside Beethoven, Bach, and Brahms, he was not a giant, but he was a very tall man. The Ottawa citizen thinks this about sizes Truman up. But an Atlantic coast paper, the Sydney Post record, goes back to where Truman began, to his humility, which made his achievement the more impressive. It finds that... It is of the utmost significance to everyone who has faith in democracy that a man who shared the belief of many others that he was lacking in the greatness needed for his tremendous task did, in fact, measure up to all it demanded when he was put to the test. It is evident from all this that Mr. Truman's farewell talk was a great success, turning quite exceptional attention to his achievements in office and also to his manner of leading it. The Montreal Gazette thinks that... There is something very heartening in a democratic system when the man who leaves the center of power for his hometown says that it is really all quite as it should be, and when he speaks of his own strains and anxieties in office in order to ask the nation to be sympathetic towards his successor. In spite of all that has been said here about Mr. Truman, much more, of course, has been written about his successor, President Eisenhower. It is safe to say that his inaugural was greeted with an editorial in every single Canadian paper. As to Quebec City, Chronicle Telegraph said he was the most talked about and written about man in the world, and the enemies as well as the friends of the United States were waiting to see what he would do. This paper takes the attitude that we still don't know much more about Eisenhower's views than we did when he took off his uniform last June. But the St. John's Newfoundland Evening Telegram finds assurance in the record of 17 other army officers who have become president of the United States, and in Eisenhower's ten years of high administrative experience during the war and in NATO. The Moncton, New Brunswick transcript salutes a new president of a great country and thinks that no president in the history of the United States ever took office with more confidence from the people. This paper goes on. This widespread faith in General Eisenhower's fitness rests on an appraisal both of the man and his works. It is founded on the feeling of trust which is inspired by his simplicity, his candor, his habit of forthrightness. It is reinforced by respect and admiration for the skill and good judgment, the high courage and firm resolution which he has brought to the handling of every situation with which he has been called upon to deal. These are the fundamental qualities of leadership. As might be expected, there's a good deal of lyric prose expended on this great occasion. The Vancouver province from beyond the Rockies speaks of Eisenhower coming to office at a time when a new world has taken form. We have stepped over the threshold of the machine age into the scientific age. Mankind may blot itself out and so on unless Eisenhower provides the leadership. The Montreal star quoting from the eloquent inaugural speech says, It was all there, all that liberty-loving peoples had hoped and prayed that they would get from Eisenhower. Indeed, much more, for clearness of mind and strength of purpose are, in a free society, not enough for the greatest leadership. There must also be the infinite power of inspiration. His word struck sparks of fire with their strength and their beauty. Each to his own taste. The Ottawa citizen, still dubious of the consideration which a Republican United States will give to the interests and views of other nations, treats the inaugural address as one of broad generalities and high sentiments. It thinks the speech lacked the warmth and imaginative quality of President Truman's .4 pronouncement in 1949. Crossly, this paper comments that, President Eisenhower might be thought less than generous in his remark that allies, though they may expect help, must help themselves, too. His words seem to reflect the outlook of those Americans who remain convinced that other nations have really done little for themselves or for the common cause of freedom. The Winnipeg Free Press looks soberly past the joyous celebration to comment that, just as George Washington could hardly have imagined that the poor and quarreling colonies of his time would one day become the great nation of today, or Lincoln could have conceived of the misery to follow his inauguration, so no one knows today what the new chapter of history, opened with Eisenhower's inauguration, will bring. The Western paper finds that the most important qualification which Eisenhower brings to his job is his broad internationalism, his understanding of the world at large, and his will to cooperate with it. In this respect, the new Republican president is the heir of Root, Hughes, and Vandenberg. Yet, the paper also looks closely at his domestic policy and finds that, Mr. Eisenhower is not attempting to reestablish an era now dead or to liquidate the great social gains which that era provided. He is attempting to arrest trends, especially in the field of finance, which of themselves imperil those gains. He is determined to prevent the nation's economic system from weakening itself by excessive commitments. He asks it to live within its means, within its means, rather, and undoubtedly, he will expect other nations, now dependent on United States aid, to do likewise. The nearest American approach to a coronation is the way the Edmonton Journal speaks of the inauguration. It holds that Dwight D. Eisenhower has become president not only of the United States, but in a very real sense of the whole free world. In his hands may lie the decision as to peace or war for all of us. For this awesome responsibility, however, the paper finds him well prepared, and with an exceptionally able administration gathered round him. The Toronto Star, among many others, approves the choice of John Foster Dulles, Harold Stassen, Beatle Smith, and Dr. Conant of Harvard University for leading posts in foreign affairs. Talking about foreign affairs, the Toronto Globe and Mail takes time out in the midst of all this to note the achievements of Dean Acheson. It says, when the history of these times is written, Mr. Acheson may well be ranked among the great secretaries of state. According to all accounts, Mr. Truman relied strongly on Mr. Acheson's advice in international affairs. If the foreign policy of the United States has been both prudent and energetic in the last four years, the credit for that achievement belongs in part to the retiring secretary of state. The Globe thinks that when the animosity which Mr. Acheson roused, partly by his manner and his unconcealed intellectual superiority has cooled off, his proper worth will be appreciated. If the Canadian press seems to be very kind to the Democrats, then let us be reminded by the Moncton transcript that it is a harsh historical fact that no Republican president has ever done much for Canada. There are plenty of editorials worrying about Republican trade policies and a number this week supporting our external affairs minister, Lester Pearson, in his offer of Canadian cooperation in any scheme the U.S. may devise to reduce trade barriers. But while Foreign Minister Pearson was saying this, Resources Minister Winters was turning down a proposal by the Aluminum Company of America for the diversion of the waters of the Yukon River in order to set up a giant new aluminum smelter near Skagway, Alaska. The Winnipeg Tribune says, From the Canadian standpoint, there are two big objections to the proposed diversion. In the first place, it would mean the loss of a large amount of hydroelectric power. And in the second place, the Alaska development would have a harmful effect on the Canadian development at Kitimat, which incidentally received little help from some U.S. sources. Ottawa has wisely objected to the scheme. This aluminum project at Kitimat, out on the Pacific coast, just below Alaska, is one of the biggest things Canada has ever tackled. Perhaps some of you have seen the story in January Harpers. Just to show you how high some of our people are riding on these big post-war developments, here is the view of the Ottawa Journal that Canada isn't likely to have an economic recession this year, or next year, or in later years for that matter. It proclaims, Short of world war, or some other sort of cataclysm, this country's prosperity, propelled by discoveries and developments of previously unimaginable wealth, would appear to be unavoidable. Canada would seem to be almost foolproof against recession. Our fortune is so great that even our mistakes can hardly cripple us. And that ought to be just about enough over the back fence for this week. This has been Over the Back Fence, a regular program of comments clipped from Canadian newspapers about issues of interest and concern to the United States and Canada. The commentator was Wilson Woodside, foreign editor of Saturday Night. Over the Back Fence was distributed by the National Association of Educational Broadcasters and was transcribed this week in Toronto by the International Service of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
