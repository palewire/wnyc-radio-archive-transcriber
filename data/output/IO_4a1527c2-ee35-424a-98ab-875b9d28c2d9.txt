Your City Station now presents another important transcribed report on civil defense. Each week at this time, Commissioner Arthur Wallander, Civil Defense Director for New York City, discusses with the head of the City Department just what steps have been taken by the department concerned to meet the needs of our civil defense system. Present with Commissioner Wallander now is Frederick H. Zermilan, Commissioner of Public Works for the City of New York and Director of the Public Works Emergency Division for Civil Defense. Now to introduce this week's report on civil defense, here is Commissioner Wallander. Good evening, everyone. I am happy to again bring you additional information on the progress of our civil defense plans. Tonight, I'm going to ask Public Works Commissioner Zermilan to give us some of the highlights of his department's role in our defense organization. Through these informal talks, we hope to keep the public well posted on the steps we are taking for their protection. Commissioner Zermilan, how is your department getting along at the present time? Well, Commissioner Wallander, I'm happy to report that since our last interview on this station, our Public Works Emergency Division has made tremendous gains. We are well organized. We have enrolled more than 50,000 trained personnel. Our siren installation is nearing completion. The inventory of construction equipment that can be used for defense purposes has been accelerated. The construction of our Borough Control Centers is well underway. Our construction units are functioning. The key engineers of my department, the Department of Public Works, have been permanently assigned to civil defense work. We have taken steps to prevent sabotage of vital city property, such as our 49 toll-free bridges, our 61 public buildings, and our 13 sewage treatment plants. In fact, Commissioner, our Public Works Emergency Division is fairly jumping these days with activity. Well, that's mighty fine to hear, Commissioner Zermilan. But before we go into some of the details, suppose we briefly review just how your operation is geared to the city's overall defense program. Well, the best way to see how the Public Works Emergency Division works is first to imagine what would happen in the event of an enemy attack. Let us suppose that a bomb should be dropped at any moment on some section of our city. Well, that's easy for me, Fred, because I have lived with such thoughts for the longest time, during World War II, and ever since our present troubled international situation, and again, made defense preparations necessary. To best prepare is to envision all of the problems that follow in the wake of a bombing attack. Obviously, in a congested city such as ours, the chaos and disaster almost defies the most vivid imagination. Nevertheless, we have formed a pretty good idea and are making every effort to cope with all eventualities. The most immediate and pressing problem after a bombing attack is the resultant mountain of debris, the millions of tons of twisted steel and concrete rubble which would choke our streets and block rescue efforts. But then, that's where the Public Works Emergency Division comes in, doesn't it? Right you are, Commissioner. Fire apparatus will probably be the first to go into action, followed by ambulances and police services at the scene of the disaster. But then our division will operate to clear debris, perform heavy duty rescue work, and repair fractured mains to restore greatly needed public utilities. The streets must be cleared of those mountains of debris, which you mentioned, before anything could be done. Prompt appraisal of a bomb area must be made by trained engineers to determine what type of equipment and help are needed. To tunnel through, shore up, brace, or evacuate a stricken area. From our control centers, our heavy construction equipment will be dispatched to prepare an area for rescue. We must remember, too, that broken gas mains, steam pipes, water mains, power lines and sewers all present additional hazards to rescue and rehabilitation work. Our public works emergency division will have charge of shutting off these subsurface utilities. We will also have to coordinate whatever illumination control is necessary for blackouts as well as for rescue work. Our forces will aid also in the decontamination of stricken areas by flushing with water, spraying with liquid neutralizers, covering with sand and chemical mixtures, and through the use of other techniques being developed particularly in relation to atomic warfare. Well, what progress are you making to secure the proper type of equipment and trained personnel for this work? Tell us, how many have you enrolled to date? Well, Commissioner, we've done very well in recruiting of volunteers, particularly since we must have engineers and experienced people in the field of heavy construction work, and in the installation of public utilities and the use and maintenance of our streets. We have already enrolled more than 50,000 volunteers. About 30,000 of these, of course, are from the various city departments whose functions are related to this type of operation. They include the offices of the five borough presidents, the departments of water supply, gas, and electricity, housing and buildings, sanitation, city housing authority, and even the Bureau of Franchises. In addition, we have recruited about 20,000 skilled employees, mostly from the Consolidated Edison Company and the various lighting and gas companies throughout our city. I have also addressed various engineering societies and contractors associations with a view of enrolling additional technical help. We have, as a result of that, already about 1,000 individual volunteers of the professional or engineering and architectural group. Well, that's a very fine record, I'd say, Commissioner Zemillon. And I want to take this opportunity to thank you and to thank those who have volunteered and urge others listening in who are qualified to get in touch with the Public Works and Agency Division and do something about this civil defense effort. Now, the last time we discussed equipment, you were about to undertake one of the largest inventories of city and privately owned construction equipment ever made. What's the latest report on that, Commissioner Zemillon? Yes, Commissioner, in fact, it is the largest inventory of its kind ever made. Everything from picks and shovels to heavy cranes and bulldozers are being compiled into a master list, which will designate not only the type and amount of equipment, but exactly where the equipment is located at all times. Now, what provisions are you making to keep the list up to date? We all know that construction equipment is moved from job to job by contractors, but how do you keep tabs on equipment that might be of use during an emergency? That is, where would it be at the time that you want it? How do you do that? Well, Commissioner, we have concocted and we are doing this through an intricate cataloging system requiring the use of high-speed IBM machines. The final inventory will be broken down into individual types of equipment and by borough and precinct locations. Copies of the breakdown lists will be supplied to each borough control center for the purpose of arranging a system of mutual aid. As soon as it is decided what type of equipment is needed in a particular area, the borough control center will direct the moving of such equipment from the place where the equipment is located. The inventory will be kept up to date by a postcard notice and periodic telephone contacts whenever registered equipment is moved to a new location. Hundreds of contractors have already been canvassed and are cooperating very nicely in this work. I think it will be interesting to know how much of the more commonly used construction equipment is already listed. Well, that's easy. For example, we know right at this moment where we could lay our hands on such items as 7,885 motor vehicles, 470 trailers, 220 truck cranes, and 450 tractors and bulldozers. Small tools already include some 13,600 shovels, 6,775 picks, and over 3,000 crowbars. We have listed over 2,000 pumps of various types and sizes. And over 1,600 oxygen acetylene welding and burning outfits. We have 664 air compressors, 451 auxiliary generators. It is a mighty long and diversified list, Commissioner. Too long for the time limitations of this broadcast. But I think what I have quoted will give you a rough idea of the magnitude of the inventory. Is the progress of the control centers you mentioned keeping pace with the overall developments of our civil defense program? Oh, yes. I didn't mention that before because, as you know, a certain amount of security is involved in connection with our control centers. But I can say this much. Twenty-three of our report centers are very near completed. Seven are already ready for training purposes. The Queensboro Control Center is substantially completed. And in about one week, the Brooklyn Control Center will be ready for staffing. More than $200,000, Commissioner, has been allocated for the construction work and finishings of these report and control centers. Are key personnel being trained for service in these control centers? Yes, we are training with the use of films, slides, and other visible aids. We have trained some 600 Public Works Emergency Division personnel on atomic warfare. In addition, our own Public Works Department has enrolled about 500 trainees in the Red Cross instructor course to date. More than 300 already have been graduated and will become instructors to spread their knowledge among other departments. Of tremendous importance, of course, is to make certain that an adequate alarm system can be sounded in the event of an enemy attack. How many sirens are now operating? At this moment, 442 could be sounded. 100 more are being installed. We have bids prepared for 20 more. And with enough spares to provide replacement when necessary, we will have a grand total of 675 sirens, which will blanket the city, which we believe without a single dead spot anywhere. Well, that's mighty good news, Commissioner Zemelin. I think our time is running short, and I'd like to compliment you on a job well done. I think the people of our city will be reassured by what they have heard tonight. Whether at war or at peace, the military forces of our nation are only as strong as the determination of the people to carry on the activities of production and government, which an attack on cities and industrial areas is intended to disrupt. Let us never forget that the enemy, whether just contemplating or actually waging war, counts the cost of attack in terms of results achieved. Obviously, a city well prepared for defense offers a less inviting target. We're very pleased to have you with us tonight, Commissioner Zemelin, and I thank you for this fine and illuminating talk. I do, Commissioner. Thank you very much, gentlemen. You've been listening to another in the important series of Reports on Civil Defense, in which Civil Defense Director Arthur Wallander discusses specific aspects of our New York City Civil Defense Organization, with the heads of city departments. Presenting his report this evening was Frederick H. Zemelin, Commissioner of Public Works for the City of New York, and Director of the Public Works Emergency Division for Civil Defense. We'd like to remind our listeners that next Tuesday evening, at this same time, the facilities of your city station will once again be devoted to another transcribed report on civil defense.
