Soft eyes of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, it won't be long, we're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray. We're going down south, hooray. Hanson's makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I've hunder, wondering, darling, is your true. Distance only, land and shun's land, all the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near your side. Be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother, just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, just be near, Christ is near. When the harvest days are over, just be near. And the harvest days are over, just be near.

He's a bird in a gilded hay. A little brown car, a shady green spot. So happier home I find. My heart's barely gone, I love only one. She's the girl I left to be mine. Just one girl, only just one girl. Where on earth I know what's left on my side. Come, oh, hey, she is just one day. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian.

Take her, boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I do. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born, sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Come, rat, when man was born, they blew their life, we cried. When they just read us, my darling, old comrade, what's there by my side? There's a name that's never spoken, and a mother's heart has broken. There is just another living from the old home that belongs. There is still a memory living. There's a father of the old home. And a picture that is found. Hold the wall. Should we purchase a hold? There is also a memory of the old home. Take your home. Do not give them law. Please be our tree as mine should us."
