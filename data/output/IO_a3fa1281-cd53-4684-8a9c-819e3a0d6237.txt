As I walk along the Wapu Long with an independent air, you can hear the girls declare, he must be a millionaire. You can hear them sigh and wish to die, you can see them wish the other eye, at the man that broke the bank at Monte Carlo. As I walk along the Wapu Long with an independent air, you can hear the girls declare, he must be a millionaire. You can hear them sigh and wish to die, you can see them wish to die, the other eye of the band that comes to bank at Monte Carlo. I walk along the Wapu Long with an independent air, you can hear them sigh and wish to die, you can hear them sigh and wish to die. Don't you hear them sigh, don't you hear them sigh, there's a ringing sound, the glory of the day. Don't you hear them bell, don't you hear them bell, they're ringing out the glory of the day. Don't you hear them bell, they're ringing out the glory of the day. Don't you hear them bell, they're ringing out the glory of the day. Don't you hear them bell, they're ringing out the glory of the day. The great sun's day, down to her home we go. All of white and all of them, they love and joy. All of them, they love and joy. I've had it through, I know. Here's the first night of paradise party. Two little girls in blue, lad. Two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad, who won your father's home. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted apart. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow's last is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I see. Comrade, comrade, ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Comrade, when man was born, they blew all their eyes behind. When danger's precious, my darling, no comrade was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken, and a mother's heart have broken. There is just another one missing from the old home that we belong. There is still a memory living. There's a father on the old home. And a picture that is true, Who's the one? She's my sweetheart, I'm her boy. She's my honey, my barred bow. Good real valley, never to fall. With my honey to me, it's my sweetheart. And cruel and little fellow. A I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die If you want to get to heaven in the good old way If you want to get to heaven, get to heaven If you want to get to heaven, get to heaven If you want to get to heaven, get to heaven If you want to get to heaven, get to heaven Sweet Marie Sweet Marie Not because your face is fair, love to see But your soul, so pure and sweet Makes my happiness complete Makes me fall at your feet, sweet Marie Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that style? Isn't it a knobby one and just a proper style? I'd just like to have one, just the same as that Where'er I go they shout, hello! Where did you get that hat?
