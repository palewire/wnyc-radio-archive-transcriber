Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun, get the gun. Johnny, I have seen you. Oh, it brings my heart to soul. Don't think that the I am needed.

It's just the proper style. I'd like to have one just the same as that. Where'er I go, they shout, ''Hello'' Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir, but not goodbye. The past is dead, love cannot die. The past were better far had we not met. I loved you then. I loved you, yes. Lady, Lady, give me your hand, the truth. I love crazy, all for the love of you. It won't be a smiling marriage, I can't afford a family. But you don't speak, all for the love of you. I think so dim for two. When you hear the bells of things in me, for joy, love, and praise the U.S. sing. And when the birds stand through, in the forest of the night, there'll be a hot night with your calm and night. When you hear the bells of things in me, for joy, love, and praise the U.S. sing. And when the birds stand through, in the forest of the night, there'll be a hot night with your calm and night.
