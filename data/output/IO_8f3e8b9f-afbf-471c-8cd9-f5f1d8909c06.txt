We say that right in the middle of our explanation why the radio came in and we're down here at Idlewild, New York's international airport, where a great company is assembled to combine Richmond, Brooklyn, Army and Youth Day. Just a few moments ago, a young Master DeVito took off in a helicopter and was carried over to a Scandinavian plane that will take him on a goodwill trip to Europe. And the poise of this youngster, he didn't seem to be much more than 10 or 12 years old. He was speeded on his way by Borough President Hall of Richmond. And just as the helicopter left with the youth on his way to carry the message of youth to Europe, why the other helicopter of the Navy, the Sikorsky, has just landed and Borough President Cashmore is standing at attention, receiving the salute of guns as they are taking off here with all the formalities of a great day at Idlewild. Borough President Hall has gone down to greet him and these two great boroughs of Richmond and Kings, to be more exact, but more affectionately Brooklyn, are holding forth here today in the formalities. Now there's still a few moments, the guns are still going and the President can't move while the prodigal prevails. But as soon as it's concluded, why he and Borough President Hall will come back to the speaker's stand. We'll have music by the department of, the police department rather, band and glee club. And when the time comes for the anthem, with distinguished artist singing as well, Marjorie Fabregas, and then the regular order of program, the formalities of these two Brooklyn, these two boroughs rather, we're not entirely all Brooklyn, just part. And the Borough of Kings, more affectionately as I said Brooklyn, will take over. And the guns are still going off and the Borough President has to stand there until all the prodigal formalities are finished. We're having a lot of fun here at Idlewild. We're demonstrating the facility of aviation with the calmness and ease with which this Sikorsky, Navy Sikorsky, dropped here on the ground right in front of the speaker's stand on a space that is not much bigger than the ordinary extension roof of a private dwelling. We conducted that fine exhibition of communications and their facilities from the Herald Tribune plane a little previous to that. And the air factors of the show here today have been very interesting. And if that gun ever stops firing, we'll have some other kind of a program as well. And now, Groveray Whalen has conducted his guests here to the stand, and it'll only be a few moments now while felicitations and greetings are going on here at the speaker's stand before we present Mr. Whalen. This wonderful air show here today at Idlewild and every day this week, despite prevailing ceilings, why, they've put on wonderful demonstrations. Those jet planes, despite low ceilings, they've done some very remarkable flying, breathtaking flying, in fact. And then we've had all the dramatization of Coast Guard rescue work with the various types of helicopters. In fact, every way that aviation may be adapted to the present-day situation, why we've had that demonstration. Our host, Mr. Whalen, is very anxious that the police department make arrangements for the public to come in and occupy the seats here in the boxes and reserve sections here. He wants everybody to sit down and take a seat, and he knows that the police department, in their own smiling, efficient way, will manage this and permit the people to occupy these seats here. Mr. Whalen requests that his guests be seated so that they may enjoy this program here today. What do you want, Eddie? Yeah. Well, just to show you that the police department is always alerted, Eddie Dillinger now tells me that they're ready to give us some music before we start the regular formalities because all the neighbors from Brooklyn and Richmond are shaking hands and saying hello. So we'll listen now to the police glee club while they consistently sing Jubilee. Thank you. It's 50 years today. It's the golden jubilee of the city of New York. 50 years and we have really known a lot, and we're thankful for the many blessings that we've got. Oh, congratulations too. To the hope I borrows through. So I know that we are very proud to be at the golden jubilee of the city of New York. It's the golden jubilee of the city of New York. Everywhere you go, you hear the folks all say that New York's the greatest city in the world today. Of the russian ancient city Makes no difference what you're free So I know that we are very proud to be At the golden jubilee of the city of New York N-E-W-Y-O-R-K New York! Thank you very much, gentlemen of the police glee club. We'll have the musical facilities of the police band under Captain Eugene LeBar and Eddie Dillon conducting the police glee club in the formal features of this ceremony and a fine young lady will sing the anthem when that time comes. Mr. Whelan is taking a few moments in order that the expressed wish of Mr. Whelan that the police department arrange for the people to take the seats up here front and join in with the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens in the celebration here today at Idlewild. Today is Brooklyn, Richmond, and Army and Youth Day and as we said, for the benefit of those who may have tuned in a little late on the program just as one helicopter took off with a youth from the borough of Richmond God speeded by the borough president, Borough President Hall speeding on his way to Europe where a plane of the Scandinavian Airlines was waiting just across the field to take him from the helicopter the Navy helicopter, the Sikorsky with borough president Cashmore aboard alighted here at the field and I'm telling you if this keeps up much longer none of us will use any other transportation but air. We've had such a concept of speed, tremendous speed here and the demonstrations of air facility have been so great at Idlewild that we feel that everybody from now on in New York will be air-minded. And now I believe Mr. Whelan, our genial and competent host, the man who knows more about organizing a great demonstration to properly put forward the city of New York in its best aspects, is waiting now and we have the distinct privilege of presenting the Honorable Grover A. Whelan. Thank you, Mr. Cowan. There's nothing like having a competent announcer to introduce you and Tommy does that so well here that I'm sure that all those who have had the great pleasure of hearing him will agree with me that he does a swell job for our great municipal station, WNYC. This is, as you know, or was to be, before the elements interfered, Richmond Day. And Richmond very generously waived its sole right to the occupancy of this platform to Brooklyn. And, of course, as you all observed a few moments ago, the borough president of Brooklyn, the Honorable John Cashmore, did not come the way of all we folks, but arrived in a helicopter. He had read of the assimilated rescue that we had the other day that unfortunately had an accident. And he was hoping for a similar experience, I'm sure. I hope you also heard, I think it was the 86 guns that saluted the president upon his arrival. He told me that if he had a Brooklyn policeman here, he would have ordered the arrest of the gunner because he had not received a permit from the president of the borough of Brooklyn. He said there are presidents and presidents. And, of course, I'm not going to let him do anything to Richmond because it's an island separated from the mainland. But, Mr. President of the borough of Brooklyn, John Cashmore, may I say to you that as the chairman of the mayor's committee for the commemoration of the golden anniversary, that you were a stalwart in the belief that this great international air exposition could be successfully planned and carried out. And I'm sure that last Saturday when you were here, when the eyes of the world were upon us, that we proved successfully that your judgment was correct. And I wish to take this opportunity to thank you personally for what you have done in connection with this great operation, as well as the borough president of Richmond, the Honorable Cornelius Paul, both members of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment who believe that the New York International Airport needed just this to start it on its worldwide service to aviation. It's a great privilege for me to present to you, ladies and gentlemen, the Honorable John Cashmore, President of the borough of Brooklyn. Thank you, Grover. And I want to say to you on behalf of the greatest city's greatest borough, the borough of Brooklyn, that while you are the greatest salesman in the world, I know how hard you've worked for four months to put this exhibition over. And while you're known as Smiling Grover Whalen, we're going to give you a new name because of the unfortunate weather conditions. And your new name, Grover, is Whaling Whalen. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Marjorie Fabregas of the Metropolitan Opera will sing our national anthem. Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early night what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight All the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That of life was still there O'er say does that dark-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the brave And the home of the brave Will you please remain standing While the Reverend Cornelius Greenway Pastor of All Souls Church of Brooklyn Gives the invocation Almighty God Grant that we are here today Not to strut Not to preen our feathers of possession And power But that we are here to dedicate the field To the service of mankind And grant that every plane that leaves this field And every plane that arrives May be a messenger of goodwill Among men and nations Everywhere Amen Thank

Woodruff Deputy Army Commander General Woodruff Won't you please Stand up and take a bow General Woodruff You and I know That there is only one band In the city of New York So without further ado Let's hear from the Police Department band In a musical salute To the United States Army Which one is this? This us? This us? This us? This us? This us? This us? Come on The End The End The End The End Thank you. We are to hear next from the head of one of the best-known colleges in our part of the country. I am pleased to present the president of Wagner College, Dr. Walter Langsam. Dr. Langsam. Mr. Chairman, gentlemen of the clergy, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is fitting that on this golden jubilee occasion, the day set aside to honor the county of Richmond should also be Youth Day. For surely that community, though old is a settled part of the United States, is young in spirit and potentialities. And these potentialities are closely tied to the character and ambitions of our youth in this great city. To judge from accounts published in the newspapers and magazines, it is the duty of adult speakers who address youth groups nowadays to warn their young listeners against the cold, cruel world which is waiting to attack them the moment they leave the shelters of home and school. The boys and girls who make up the boys and girls who make up the boys and girls who make up the listening groups customarily are told about the crushing responsibilities that they soon must shoulder and about their heavy duties as future citizens. Or they are warned that society already has called two strikes on them and that they have only one small chance in a thousand to avoid a fate of spiritual emptiness. For better or worse, I do not feel in the mood this afternoon to give that sort of discouragement. As one who grew up in and loves the city of New York, and as one with 25 years experience in the study and teaching of history, I am firmly convinced that life in the world today is better than it was yesterday. I have come to feel that any self-reliant, intelligent young person of today, particularly in the United States, can be happy and prosperous tomorrow. To go far towards achieving this happiness and prosperity, it is only necessary, in my opinion, to develop three simple personal characteristics. These three attributes are faith, optimism, and friendliness. To have faith means to know that God is interested in you as an individual. You cannot get faith from any other man or woman. You must feel it from within. It comes to you through the grace of God. But having faith, you can grow in it. For faith is something which is nourished and strengthened by practice and use. You can generally recognize a person of faith by his or her self-reliance and confidence. Faith makes an individual one to stand on his own feet. The citizen who has faith does not wait for the world to hand him a living. He goes out and cheerfully works for his living. He knows that hard work and skill in any station of life will bring their own reward. He wants to improve the world, not tear down society. He wants to help his fellow men because he knows that every one of them was created in the image of God. Let us turn now to our second attribute, optimism. Here again, it has become somewhat the fashion to be pessimistic. And to be truthful, there is much ammunition for the profits of gloom. They can point to our epidemic of strikes and to our crime waves. They can talk of the latest international rivalries in the Balkans, the Near East and the Middle East. They can speak of famine and disease and the dangers of the misuse of atomic energy. But even if we are realists and recognize that there is much evil in the world, there remains plenty of cause for optimism. After all, right has triumphed over wrong in the greatest war in all history. The dignity of the individual has been upheld against evil forces that tried to drown him in an unthinking mass. Potentially strong United Nations has replaced the weak League of Nations. There has been amazing recent progress in medicine and the application of science to industry in the creation of more comforts for more people. Even the strikes, serious though they may be, cannot be called strikes against oppression and poverty. They are strikes to get for millions of people the highest income that labor has ever received. Looked at from this angle, the life ahead of us is life in a fascinating world. It is life in a world rich in custom and tradition, but a world also of progress, of change, of development. Almost I am tempted to agree with the wise old man who said, Ah, youth is a wonderful thing. What a pity to waste it on children. By all means, let us be open to change, but not to change merely for the sake of change. It is just as foolish to try to change things merely because they are traditional as it is to hold on to views simply because they are traditional. One must learn to judge each case on its own merits. When change obviously means improvement, then change is in order. Otherwise, it is better to cling to the tried and true. And now for our last point, namely the matter of friendliness. Have you not found that people usually react towards you exactly as you approach them? Most of the people whom we meet in life are good and kindly people. Oh, some have poorer manners than others. Some are more aggressive than others. Some are less helpful than others. But most of them want to do that which is ethically right. And always remember that your own good breeding is the best safeguard against other people's bad manners. And now, in closing, let me repeat my hope that we may all grow in faith, be optimistic of the future, and be friendly to our fellow men. Then will we earn the pride of our city, the gratitude of our country, and the blessing of God. Thank you, Dr. Lansom. The famous police department glee club will now take over for a few minutes.

United States Laid emphasis On the value to the Air Force The Army and the Navy On the planes that have been developed Since the World War And which can use the airport Upon the destructors of these planes And in general Upon the military might That it is hope Will keep our country at peace The President referred to the New York International Airport As a symbol of peace And at the same time As a most powerful implement For obtaining and keeping the peace The mayor gave us his view That a full appreciation Of what the International Airport Means to this community Will come with the years Today has been set aside As Brooklyn Day And Richmond Day Our borough thus Has an opportunity to show Its great interest In air transportation We accept With satisfaction The estimates Of the military usefulness Of the world's greatest airfield And we have complete realization Of the part That it will play In the development Of the Army Navy And Air Forces But it is to air transportation As a major tool In Brooklyn's Daily commercial life That we wish To address ourselves Brooklyn Is the fourth city In volume Of retail trade In the country It is the seventh In total Industrial production Just recently The Brooklyn Eagle Had occasion To survey The air possibilities For borough industry This fact finding study Demonstrated The need for improved Airline service For the heavy Brooklyn air traffic And led to the establishment Of the consolidated air services Directly from the barrow It is interesting to observe What this survey Of the status Of commercial aviation In Brooklyn developed It showed That in the hundreds Of persons And industry Queried Two out of every three Indicated that they use The airlines Regularly For business Purposes One Out of every three Industrial firms Has a travel plan Or a transportation Charge account One Out of every three Uses air cargo In one form Or another These facts However Are not surprising When you consider That over 50% Of the freight That clears Out of the port Of New York Is shipped From Brooklyn Piers And within The next 45 days 750 freighters Will clear From Brooklyn Ports Much of the cargo That clears Through Brooklyn Docks Is initiated By Brooklyn Industry There are 308 concerns In the borough Actively engaged In importing And exporting The possibilities Of developing Airline travel Originating or Terminating In the borough Are shown When it is realized As the borough President said That the International airport Is just Eight and a half Miles From the borough Hall Probably a shorter Distance Than any other Bus or airline Terminal In the city There is Practically No limitation To the possible Growth of Brooklyn Passenger And commercial Air travel The people Of no community Will have A greater sense Of air travel Consciousness Industry As well As individuals Will come To realize The proximity Of this airport To the very Center Of the borough We at Brooklyn Are happy To take part In the dedication Of the
