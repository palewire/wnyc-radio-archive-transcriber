On this very historic site at Bowling Green in front of the Custom House, we're celebrating Maritime Day today and a very interesting observation of that date is being arranged and has been arranged by the committee under the auspice of the American Merchant Marine Institute in cooperation with the War Shipping Administration. Mr. Harry M. Durning, collector of customs, will be the first voice you hear. Mr. Durning. Miss Helen Jensen of the Metropolitan Opera House will now sing The Star-Spangled Banner. Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proddy we hail At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight All rampant we watched Were so gallantly streaming And rocket's red glare From a fancy in air In the twilight's last gleaming In the twilight's last gleaming Oh, say does that the twilight's last gleaming The perilous fight O land of the free And the home of the brave And the home of the brave We'll now have the invocation by Dr. Harold H. Kelly Of the Seaman State Institute O God, would us show thy wonders to those who go down to the sea In ships and occupy their business in great waters We implore for the merchant marine Which we honor On this National Maritime Day Thy benediction and guidance Deepen in all maritime leaders A sense of responsibility And inspire harmonious cooperation Between capital, management and labor Enabling all to prosper As they render proper service To our citizenry And to the world As the ships traverse the oceans With which thou hast bound the continents And the isles together May they continue as envoys of enduring peace We ask this in the name of thy son Our master, Jesus Christ Amen Mr. Taylor Admiral Leary Admiral Kincaid And friends Here to gather today As collector of customs At the Port of New York It is again my privilege To welcome you here today And to extend to you The facilities of the custom house In honor of National Maritime Day Proclaimed by President Truman As a day to be set aside By the people of the United States In memory and in honor Of the American merchant marines Its officers and seamen This year more than ever With the secession of hostilities We have caused to be thankful And to pay homage to the officers And men of our merchant marines Whose courage and fortitude Have contributed so much To our victory While I stand here And look back over the years It started with the war abroad In September of 1939 And ended with the victory over Japan In August of last year I cannot but recognize The foresightness Of our late President Roosevelt That brought about the team wing Which made this victory possible It is a sad commentary However That today We are fritting away The fruits of this hard won goal Today we have nothing but discord Not alone amongst ourselves But between nations The shooting is over But there is no peace in the world Nor is a unity amongst ourselves Instead of pulling as a team As we did in war We are pulling in opposite directions Let us ask ourselves Why this is To what end What can be accomplished By such discord If this gathering Here today Serves any purpose Let us be That each of us Examine ourselves And find out What we can contribute To the cause of unity And peace So that the peoples Of this great country May once more enjoy The fundamental privileges Which our founding fathers Entrusted to us To all of you To all of you Who have contributed To the struggle That is behind us Our deep appreciation And abiding thanks To all of you Who are participating In the struggle For peace and unity I ask that you give To your government The same loyalty And untiring efforts Which you so willingly gave In the stress of war It is now my pleasure To introduce to you The Honorable Frank J.

Navy gun crews aboard merchant ships and convoy protection helped deliver the goods while a never-ending fuel line maintained by merchant tankers kept the Navy supplied at sea. It was cooperation of the highest order and gave full meaning to the term sea power. Our next speaker has had first-hand knowledge of this in many areas throughout the world. It is my honor and privilege to present Admiral Thomas C. Kincaid, Commander of the Eastern and Gulf Sea Frontiers. Admiral Kincaid. Mr. Mayor, distinguished guest, ladies and gentlemen I am very grateful for the opportunity of ambushing the group gathered here today. Mr. Mayor, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful for the opportunity of addressing the group gathered here today. First, to express my congratulations to the sponsors for this National Maritime Day and for the great purpose for which it stands. Secondly, to repeat, to reiterate, to say again the things which I always say when I speak of the Merchant Marine. Most of you think of the Merchant Marine in terms of the part it plays in trade and commerce, in the economy of our country. That, of course, is extremely important. My own direct interest in the Merchant Marine concerns the part it plays in sea power, in the sea power of today. It is not possible to think or talk of sea power in terms of sea power of 20, 30, or 40 years ago. Sea power today is something quite different. You cannot think of sea power without that new element, air power. Nor can you think of sea power in the present day without the old element of the Merchant Marine. But that element has so greatly enhanced in importance, so greatly changed in its position relative to the overall word sea power, that it too is new. There was a time when the Merchant Marine very much needed the Navy for protection. The Navy's job was to open the sea lane to permit the Merchant Marine to go where it pleased, where it was necessary to go, to carry out its normal business. Today, the picture is not one-sided. Today, not only does the Merchant Marine need the Navy, but today the Navy very much needs the Merchant Marine. Without the Merchant Marine, the Navy could not give that protection, of which I have just spoken. Our operations today are worldwide. The logistic problem is enormous. A Navy on its own, without the Merchant Marine, would very soon lose strength in the distant waters. The Merchant Marine today is not only important, is not only absolutely necessary from the point of view of trade and commerce, from the point of view of our economic welfare, but it is of vital importance in producing that sea power which will give this country its protection, expanding in world affairs, which it is entitled to. Again, I offer my congratulations to the sponsors for this National Maritime Day and express my best wishes and that of the Navy for success in the things they are trying to do. Thank you. Thank you very much, Admiral Kincaid. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

We have today the world's largest merchant marine. This merchant marine was built on the pressure of war. It was sailed by American seamen and operated by American steamship companies acting as agents for the War Shipping Administration. There are a good many heroes that sail these ships. Some received medals, many did not. No medals were given to employees or officials of the steamship industry, nor to the employees of the War Shipping Administration or Maritime Commission, nor did these people expect to receive them. They have had the pride of achievement of a job well done. This job was done by people who had the know-how and by a no-strike sledge of labor, afloat and ashore, that made an unbeatable combination. I believe a peacetime successful merchant marine must be built on the same kind of cooperation. Without it, chargers will move in foreign bottoms and our vessels will rust in laid-up fleets. This we must not permit. There is no need for me to say the present labor situation confronting us is not good. A good many people blame it on the war. We must not just shrug our shoulders and say it will clear up. But each should try in his own way to do something about it. There are reasons behind most labor disputes. Let's try to get at the bottom of things and clear them up. I believe that if management plays square with labor and convince labor that it is doing so, that labor will play square with management. Unfair labor practices should be avoided and so should unfair to management practices. A good many disputes start by misunderstanding. There are grievance clauses in machinery in most labor agreements. But in many recent cases in the shipping industry, they haven't been used. They should be and must be to avoid chaos and to keep cargoes and passengers moving in and on American ships. The backbone of a successful merchant marine is cargo. That is the sole purpose of a merchant marine. National defense? Yes. But merchant ships' primary job during war is moving cargo. The supplies that equipped our fighting men and our allies' fighting men moved in great proportion in ships of the American merchant service manned by American merchant crew. Congress and the public will not stand for sailing empty ships. There is no port for empty ships. Their course can lead only to a laid-up fleet. We must spread the word and make the public conscious of our merchant fleet. An American merchant marine means jobs afloat and ashore, not only in seaport cities, but in every town and village in the entire nation. We've carried the nation's war supplies. Let's carry the nation's peacetime cargoes. Mr. Taylor, this model of one of the fast new passenger liners that will serve in our merchant marine in the not-too-distant future appears to be nothing more than a toy. Yet it is symbolic of two great events in the history of American shipping. The reconversion of our merchant marine to global trade after its glorious achievement in global war. And the bold and daring plan initiated by our late President Roosevelt and reaffirmed by President Truman, which will ensure America's rightful place as a leading maritime power. In presenting this model to you as a representative of the maritime industry, I am confident you will guard it well, knowing as you do that it represents a vital contribution to our national welfare, a strong and active merchant fleet. Gracias, Nor 80's whatsoever. While we realize that this is merely a symbol of what to look forward in the future, of what he plans for the American merchant marine, I want to assure you to Merchant Marine, I want to assure you to bring the message back to the Maritime Commission and the War Shipping Administration that we do take symbols of this kind in a serious manner, and that in all the planning of the maritime industry, it is looking forward to have the finest vessels that are built throughout the world, to have the finest safety devices aboard such vessels, and to carry a greater number of the American travelers aboard a ship. Our whole symbol will be to ship and sail America. It is now my pleasure to present to you Miss Pearl Basuna, Metropolitan Opera Soprano, who will now sing Roses of Picardy. Miss Pearl Basuna.

That was beautiful. The greatness New York City has known for so long rests heavily upon the flow of commerce which passes through the port of New York. Having met every test during the busy war period, the port now looks ahead to the demands of peacetime trade. The maritime industry is fortunate to have, as its chief executive of this city, a man who keenly appreciates the importance of the port and its many facilities to the economic life of our city, our state, and our country. And it is my privilege to present to you his honor, the mayor, William O'Dwyer. Mayor O'Dwyer. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Admiral Kincaid. Admiral Smith. Admiral O'Leary. Captain Bishop. Attorney. Ladies and gentlemen. This is a most important day for the maritime industry, and particularly for the port of New York. We are gathered here to observe National Maritime Day, the first such peacetime observance since 1941. Despite our loss of more than 600 merchant ships during the war, we still have the largest and best equipped merchant marine in the world. We all vividly recall the heroic wartime accomplishments of the men and ships of our merchant marine. They maintained the lifeline of men and supplies to all our battlefronts. They, together with the Army and Navy, government agencies and industry, performed an achievement unequaled in the history of the world. They participated in every landing of our forces, from Casablanca, Anzio, Normandy, to Okinawa. The miracle of production, however, would have been to no avail if we had been unable to transport the vital supplies to the battlefront. Their contribution to victory was recognized by Generals Eisenhower and MacArthur and the admirals of the fleet. But now, the merchant marine has turned to the peacetime transportation of supplies, food for the hungry in Europe and Asia, transportation of fugitives from persecution and oppression. As the world readjusts itself to a peacetime economy, our maritime industry once more will assume its major role. The international transportation of passengers and supplies to and from our ports and the ports of the seven seas. Here in New York, we recognize our port as the greatest in the world. Its capacity was never surpassed during the war years, and its facilities were at all times capable of handling wartime traffic. More than three million men sailed from this port during the war years, while army cargo alone shipped out of the port of New York, exceeded 37 million tons. However, the port of New York cannot rest on past achievements, nor can we assume that it will continue as the leading port of the world, unless we are prepared to further develop it and to rehabilitate its tiers and docks and construct new facilities to handle the future increase in traffic. I have always been sensitive to the part the maritime industry plays in American life. I know that the maritime and related industries represented here by Mr. Ryan provide employment for thousands of men and women living in the metropolitan area. An industry of such magnitude and of such importance to our economic life must receive all possible official assistance and cooperation. With this in mind, I intend in the near future to establish a port planning commission for the city of New York. This commission will have as its members, public-spirited representatives from maritime industry and labor. This commission will make a survey and recommend the improvement and rehabilitation of our port facilities and make suggestions for the construction of new piers and terminals where necessary, and in keeping with the overall planning of the port. The members of this commission will serve without pain. Through their experience and vision and their desire to give public service, they will undoubtedly be able to make recommendations that will ensure our port supremacy. Other coastal cities have already entered into competitive planning. Gulf ports are eyeing the great future of Latin American traffic. Southeastern coastal ports, improved and developed during the war years, are grimly determined to maintain the shipping and industrial advantages they received as a result of wartime exploitation. We can retain our supremacy and support, but to do so we must have vision and courage to go ahead, and the sensitive realization that the main artery of our industrial and economic existence flows past our front door. Thank you. Mayor, thank you very much for your message. I'm sure that you give courage to everyone who is in the maritime industry and its related industries. Our program will now close with the singing of America by warrant officer William J. Ferrell of the Coast Guard. William J. Ferrell.
