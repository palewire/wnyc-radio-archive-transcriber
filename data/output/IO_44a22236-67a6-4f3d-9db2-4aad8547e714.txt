For cross and country, we associate ourselves together. These words, the first lines of the preamble to the Constitution of the American Legion, most appropriately serve to open this program, presented under the auspices of the American Legion and dedicated to the furtherance of its nationwide Back to God program, which calls for a spiritual reawakening in our time. The voices you hear are those of the West Point Military Chapel Choir. Presiding in these special services here in New York's Center Theater today is American Legion National Chaplain, Johnny Duffy. May our hearts be united in the singing of our national anthem. Oh, say can you see By the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's last gleaming Whose broad stripes and bright stars Through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watched Were so gallantly streaming And the rocket's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gave proof through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. And now may I ask American Legion past national chaplain, Rabbi David Leftowicz, Jr. of Louisiana, to deliver the invocation. Today, as we recall the sinking of the troop ship Dorchester, let us commemorate the courage of the four chaplains. John P. Washington, a Roman Catholic priest, Alexander D. Good, a rabbi, George L. Fox and Clark B. Poling, Protestant ministers, who united in prayer, gave their life belts and their lives on that day ten years ago in order that others might live. Let us, O God, inspired by the memory of their faith and sacrifice, discover the true meaning of a return to religious belief and practice. May our program back to God, offered in a spirit of reverence, be blessed with holy strength and purpose, and promote a spiritual reawakening in the hearts of our people, serving to symbolize for all nations and creeds the individual responsibility of free men, one to the other, in God. Amen. At the opening of our program, you heard the West Point Choir singing the opening phrases of the American Legion Preamble. We are pleased to present this stirring composition in its entirety. It will be sung by Morton Downey. For God and country, we associate ourselves together for the following purposes. To uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America to maintain law and order, to foster and perpetuate the 100% Americanism, to preserve the memories and incidents of our associations in the great wars, to inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the community, state, and nation. To combat the autocracy of both the classes and the masses, to make light the master of might, to promote peace and goodwill on earth. to save God and transmit to posterity the principles of justice, freedom and democracy democracy to consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by our devotion to ultrafonical and nationalofir the Vice President of these United States. I know of no organization that could more appropriately sponsor this Back to God program than the American Legion. I suppose that some of you wonder why I would make such a statement. I make it because the American Legion was founded by men whose major interest was their country, the defense of their country, the survival of their country. And naturally, we are concerned today about enemies from without, and the American Legion's program of strong national defense is therefore understandable in the light of the objectives for which it was formed. But if we study history, we will find that more great civilizations, more great nations have been destroyed because of moral decay from within than have been destroyed because of armed attack from without. And that's why it is essential in these days of conflict that if America is to survive, that America's spiritual strength must be constantly recreated in the minds and hearts of the American people. I wonder if all of us realize what a great privilege it is to live in America, to have the freedoms that we enjoy here, the privilege that it was on the inauguration of the President of the United States to listen to him open his inaugural address with prayer. That couldn't happen in half the world today. Did you ever stop to think what a great privilege it was for millions of Americans today to go to the church of their choice? You say, why, that's a privilege we have in this country under the Constitution. But you couldn't do that in half the world today. And that's why it is necessary for us to recognize that in this nation of ours, the spiritual privileges that we have, the right to worship our Maker, our God, in our own way, is one that we must defend. We must not only defend it from enemies from without, but we must also remember that a privilege, if it is to be ours, if we are to retain it, must be used. And that's why this program, this program which is dedicated to getting Americans to realize what a privilege they have to worship in their own way, is so important, and why it is such a privilege for me and others on it to appear on this occasion. And so, let us remember this. Let us remember that in this great conflict in which we are engaged throughout the world today, that military strength is important. The American Legion realizes that, and the American people know it. Our economic strength is important. But, above all, the greatest advantage we have over the slave world is the spiritual strength, which should be ours, and which I am sure will be ours and is ours under our leadership. And all of us have a part to play in creating and developing that spiritual strength, because America's spiritual strength is the sum total of the spiritual dedication of each American citizen. And so I say today, let us join with the American Legion in making America a great moral and spiritual force for good in the world in which we live.
