Radio's microphones are now located in one of the most historic rooms anywhere in the world, the room of the Board of Estimate of the City of New York, where the business of the City of New York and the epochs of history in this city have been consummated. The Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer, has just come in to the Board of Estimate room, and he's standing in front of the chair that he usually occupies at the meetings. In amidst all the applause, he's shaking his head no. Whether he means quiet or what, we don't know, but we're just waiting now till the ovation ceases, and then in just a moment, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable William O'Dwyer. Ladies and gentlemen, If we have been somewhat late, it's because of the difficulty of covering the anniversary parade in Brooklyn, which just finished. I invited as many of those as I could reach who have honored me with a movement to ask me to run again for Mayor of the City. I had been fully aware from the press and conversation after I made the announcement that my friends from various quarters of the city and from many economic levels were talking about a draft movement. I understood at that time that that was an enthusiasm of warm friendship in many cases that had come down over many years. I had never seen a political draft in my life. I had never heard of one. And I didn't expect that this movement would continue longer than a few days. So that when over this weekend I found that the movement was growing and that a great deal of organization and time and effort and possibly expense was about to be used to make this a citywide showing of what people wanted me to do I was confronted with this situation that here was first of all my own statement firmly made stated as clearly as I knew how to state it deliberately kept simple so that there couldn't be any means of misunderstanding what I said as I say there was I having said that and then a draft movement that seemed to increase rather than diminish I was confronted with this situation whether or not to wait a little longer to see if it would die of its own weight or to take a chance to let it go on for another week or ten days when if it then actually became a completed reality a lot of money spent a lot of energy spent and a large number of people misled by my silence and that's the important thing misled by my silence into believing that all that was needed was to sign on that petition I felt that the only frank thing to do not only in the case of my friends and well wishers but in the interest of the city as a whole and in the interest of clarity at this very important function that will take place next November and the life of our city to ask as many as I could find of those who were interested in the draft movement to come here this afternoon to give me an opportunity of talking to you speaking with you again as frankly as I know how now the truth is ladies and gentlemen that my decision not to run again was not a new one this is one for which I have been preparing for over a year it was with that in mind principally that I had certain reports that I mentioned a few times prepared by each and every agency of the city far back as last December I think many of you confidentially I had explained to you that I would not run again now when the statement was made it wasn't new it wasn't coy it wasn't something to mislead it was something to state frankly that I will not be a candidate for November if this draft movement were to continue no matter how big the results I should still and would still say the same thing so why continue it now what you may want for me is a statement as to why I will not be a candidate again you may ask yourselves is it because I have lost interest in our city is it because I want to go off somewhere and go to sleep and forget our city you should have the answer to that how good evil has been said about the condition of my health there's no question about it when you're almost 59 years of age and when you've given as much to this job as I have given in three and a half well you're not quite as good a condition as you were when you were a young fellow no question about that at the same time with the help of God you won't need any wheelchair for me for many years to come but they say it's true it has some bearing however on my decision I'll tell you what it is if I were to run I'd have done it with my eyes wide open no use in saying to anybody that has a conscience who's downstairs at that desk take it easy delegate I've delegated everything that's delegatable if there's such a word and it still takes 14 hours of day to handle it and I'm not counting banquets this is a rugged assignment this is one that in the interests of the city should not be approached lightly the man that takes it ought to make up his mind to understand the job at the earliest possible hour and make his mind that he's going to stay with it for the full period of his elected term I myself propose to stay with God's help with it right to midnight December 31st of this year working along just exactly as I tried to do it in the three and a half years gone by it might well be that had I accepted the nomination that you so kindly tried to procure for me no matter where it came that with the best intentions of the world because of the fact that the job is what it is might well be that something might happen during the course of the term and I would not in good conscience for that reason if that were the only reason I would not and could not in good conscience I accept an obligation where there was the slightest doubt that I couldn't fulfill it to the last second of the elected term there are many other reasons that have brought me to this conclusion with which I'm sure many of you would not agree truth is in private conversation you haven't agreed so there's no use in bringing it out me up and have me a battle with me I say there are several reasons why I will not go into it at all this afternoon I will say to you that I don't feel that I'm leaving the city in anything like the confusion in which I found it I'm prepared not only to make that statement I'm prepared to make a written document of what we've done and what still remains to be done so that it will be crystal clear to anyone who's interested in the condition of the city what has been done what the actual condition now is and what I believe still remains to be done that couldn't be done within the time at our disposal I expect to have it by the first of September so that the city as a whole will have abundant information and time to read it before they go to the polls I expect to have it in the hands of whoever succeeds me and the legislative and the legislative bodies with him to have that document for reference to know what it is what the condition is now to be able to consult with advisors if he be the kind of a mayor that has advisors sometimes you have mayors that want them sometimes you have mayors that don't but if he has there will be the document furthermore I'd be very interested to hear that document discussed by the opposing parties during the campaign I'm looking forward to the opponent's arguments against it with a great deal of expectation and I shall be very happy to defend it during the campaign if it should be attacked consequently if I have done nothing else but to clarify these things that have in the past so confused everybody and for once as the saying goes put it on the line so that everyone can see what it is that in itself is something so new in the 50 year history of this city that it's something now ladies and gentlemen in the interest of clarity so as not to confuse those who would like to present candidates for the people's inspection so that everyone will have a fair chance and that we will not by dilatory tactics have foreclosed anyone in their fair approach to ask you each and every one of you personally please understand that no matter how big the number of petition signed would be I will not run I'm going to ask you to please call it off you will not do the city in my opinion any favor by continuing it further when you know from me that at the end of a certain number of days when you do finish it I still will be of the same mind and the time for selecting other candidates will be that much shorter I believe that would not be in the best interest of the city now as to my own feeling about this ladies and gentlemen I feel this way you will understand it no man who has such enthusiastic friends as you have been to me no man can say no to a nomination that is so almost a sure fire wind no man can say that word no and be too too happy saying it I'll confess to you that I am not too happy in saying that little word no still in all a no has got to be now that doesn't mean that and to you I hasten to give you this assurance that does not mean that my interest in this city will be any less January the 1st than it is today after 39 years in this city and having received in this city every gift the magnitude of which I couldn't begin to describe because I've been too closely connected with each and every one of these honors a city that has been so kind to me has been so kind to the millions who stretched out their hands looking for help has been so kind to their children and their grandchildren and to their sick that city is too much a part of my bloodstream for me to ever neglect an opportunity where I believe that it will best serve the city to take my part in the ranks working for its benefit that is the promise I make to you and on the question of a nomination it has to be and will be definitely known thank you very much the mayor of the city of new york the hon.
