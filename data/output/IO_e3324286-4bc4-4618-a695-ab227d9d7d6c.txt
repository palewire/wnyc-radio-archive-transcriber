We honor today a man of exceedingly high position and of great distinction. His Excellency Anastasio Somoza, President of Nicaragua. His country is the largest of the Central American countries and a very friendly neighbor. On a trip to our country, he has honored our city by this visit. To officially welcome him and to award to him an appropriate scroll and the Medal of Honor of the City of New York, I now present to you the Vice President of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the Republic. I now present to you the Mayor of our city, the Honorable Vincent R. Impelletara. Mr. A. Dykes, Your Excellency President Somoza, Mr. Somoza, Distinguished Ambassador of Nicaragua to the United States of America, Distinguished Council General of Nicaragua in the City of New York, gentlemen representing the military of the Government of the United States and the Republic of Nicaragua, ladies and gentlemen, New York City is happy today to extend its traditional warm welcome to the head of a great republic south of the Rio Grande who has long been a staunch friend and ally of the United States. Our distinguished visitor is no stranger to our ways and customs, having pursued his own education in our country and having sons and daughters who receive their education here. His likes and dislikes even parallel ours because his country's great pastime, like our own, is baseball. As a matter of fact, the other day, while in our city, General Somoza had an occasion to witness one of our great baseball clubs, the New York Giants playing the St. Louis Cards. When he got up to the game, the Giants were behind. But with his rooting, in that time the Giants were four runs behind, by the time the ninth inning was over, General Somoza rooted the Giants on the victory. In his own capital city of Managua, he was a prime mover in providing for his people, a great baseball stadium seating 50,000 people. The man we honor today is a political leader in the best American tradition of advancing social welfare legislation for his people through better educational and housing facilities, road and highway construction, and modern mechanization of agriculture and industry. We welcome you, Your Excellency, for all of these reasons, but particularly because throughout your long political career as Secretary of War of your country, as Minister Plenipotentiary of your nation to Costa Rica, as Undersecretary and Acting Secretary of State, and as President of Nicaragua since 1937, you have always demonstrated a genuine and sincere friendship for the people of the United States of America. We welcome you, Your Excellency, because under your guidance and leadership, your nation has adhered closely to our own policies affecting Pan-American solidarity and defense. And finally, we welcome you, Your Excellency, because you are joined with us and the other freedom-loving nations of the world in beating back communist aggression and oppression. It is my great privilege, in behalf of all the people of the City of New York, and as a token of the bonds of friendship that exist between your people and our people, to bestow upon you New York City's scroll for distinguished public service. May I read this scroll, Your Excellency? It reads as follows. Office of the Mayor, City of New York. Know all men by these presents that I, Vincent R. Impellitari, Mayor of the City of New York, to hereby cite for distinguished and exceptional public service, His Excellency Anastasio Somoza, President of the Republic of Nicaragua, whose fervent support of the inter-American system has repeatedly proven his solidarity and sincere friendship towards the United States of America and whose great contribution towards enriching and strengthening the ties of friendship traditionally established between our two countries merits the heartfelt gratitude and sincere appreciation of the people of the City of New York and also, Mr. President, as a symbol of the affection in which the people of the City of New York hold towards you, it's my pleasure to present to you the City's Medal of Honor. Mayor Impellitari has just presented the New York City's Medal of Honor to our distinguished guest, Honorable Somoza, and they embrace each other both Latin American and American custom exchanging handshakes among the visitors here at the reception platform at City Hall Plaza. In a few moments, we will hear the response by Mr. Somoza to the Mayor's address. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The usual battery of news photographers is taking a little time now with opposing the mayor. Mrs. Impella Terry, our distinguished visitor today, Anastasio Somoza and Mrs. Somoza. More pictures now of Mr. Impella Terry and Mr. Somoza. Incidentally, if you aren't out of the house today, it's one of the finest days we've had this year. Cool and pleasant. A wonderful June day. The police department Glee Club heralded it just a few moments ago, back before the festivities began, by playing June is bus not all over, and it certainly is. Mr. Somoza is just about ready now to make his response. First here is Mr. John A. Dykes. So that he may respond to the mayor, I now have the high honor of presenting to you His Excellency Anastasio Somoza, President of Nicaragua. Mr. President. Honorable Major Impella Terry of New York, Mrs. Impella Terry, ladies and gentlemen, I was educated in this country. So was my wife and my three children. My daughter is actually the wife of the Ambassador of Nicaragua in Washington. She has six children, all born in the United States. My second boy is graduated as an engineer from the University of Maryland. And the youngest one who is in the Army of Nicaragua now is graduated from West Point. So you see, this is my second country. I was not born here, but I feel very glad, very happy when I am in the United States. I feel at home here. And every time I go away, I feel homesick for the United States. Whenever I see that beautiful flag of the birds and stars, make me feel as happy as when I see my little but wonderful blue and white flag of Nicaragua. I feel very proud to say that the Nicaraguan people, the country of Nicaragua, and President Somoza are the best friends the United States have and will ever have in Latin America. because we appreciate all the kindness, all the protection, all the help Uncle Sam has given us. And we are sincere to confess that we have received that help from this big brother of the United States who is always willing to help the small countries. And I, who are the most sincere friend of the United States, will say that even if I wasn't, I always say that America and the Western Hemisphere should be and must be together with the United States. Because we, especially the small countries, are sure and certain that as long as the United States lives as a free, a powerful country, we will be free. And in any case, the United States will disappear as a free, unpowerful country. Our fate will be to become a colony of any European or Asiatic nation. God will never permit that so we cannot live free and happy in the Western Hemisphere. Ladies and gentlemen, the honor received by me today, I receive it in the name of my people and in the name of my country. Mayor Pelletieri has done a wonderful demonstration. I want to congratulate him from the bottom of my heart from the wonderful job he has made in New York. I feel very close to him because during the last election in Nicaragua, I received the biggest majority of votes of anybody, any president ever received in the past and I know he was elected in New York with the biggest votation ever registered in the history of the election of a mayor in New York. and I am very glad and very proud as his friend but I feel very close to him now to see all he's doing, he's paying back the popularity and all the friendship he received from the people of New York doing all the progress and making New York City more beautiful every day. I feel so glad to see the progress of New York because I love this city, I love New York, I like New York, I like the Giants, I like the Dodgers and I like everything that means athleticism in this country and I, as I told him, New York is unique in the world. It's only one New York in the world and when I see it, how he keeps it so clean, so beautiful. My God, I was telling his beautiful wife going through those streets so clean and nice that you could sit down in the middle of the street and have your lunch and you feel as comfortable as you would in your own home. Major and Pelletari, I want to thank you a million times for the wonderful demonstration shown to me today for this decoration of the city of New York which I always will carry with pride and honor as a remembrance of the biggest demonstrations ever given to me in New York by a wonderful mayor, a wonderful man, a wonderful citizen and a man who really have a heart. I love people like you, Mayor and Pelletari, because you're so human. I want to congratulate you and thank you from the pattern of my heart this wonderful demonstration, this wonderful parade and permit me to congratulate your marvelous police force. Because when you see a bunch of soldiers like you have here, we Americans, we who belong to the Western Hemisphere, make us feel that we will never lose any war, that we will always win, that democracy and freedom will live forever and you must be sure that the whole continent will stick, always be, we must be and will be forever arm by arm with Uncle Sam. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I know I speak for everyone here when I say that we're sorry we do not have you as a full-time American citizen, but we're happy that Nicaragua is so ably led. We will now have some selections by the sanitation band which keeps, which is the department that keeps our streets so clean, Mr. Your Excellency, and the police glee club under the direction of Sergeant Edward Delfton.
