Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange The American Stock Exchange Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Speaker 1 of the President The President It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, this discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great king. of America was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Your services for mankind. Thank you, Mr. President. Mayor Impelitari is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and bowing and bowing and bowing and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Vittorio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it is with profound commotion that I have listened to your words affectionate and cordiales regarding my modest person and regarding the noble city that I have here the honor to represent. There are facts and acts that are made by men and every act that man has a unique meaning, but there are facts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Honorable Impiniteri, is here in Europe and is here in my city, she has not only completed a visit of cordiality, but she has also made a visit of the city of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the people of the Genovese so connected to the land of America. But she, Honorable Impiniteri, is here in Genova, ambassador of democracy, that is so expensive to men of the United States, but so expensive to the Italians, especially to the genoveses. For this, Honorable Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States and this is the way every citizen of America, regardless of its origin and its own social class, she can come to her, as she has been to come to her, as she has been to the high level representative of the city. So this is my visit, not only a response, not only a visit of the courtesia, Honorable Impiniteri. This visit is my visit to the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and his mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is, above all, the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic and has contributed to the United States and its own way to the United States, which is extremely grateful for this man and the people of the United States, to the great people of the United States, to the United States, which we are deeply grateful for, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to do for us to give us the democratic democratic democratic freedom when they have intervened so much in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men, so that today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of the democracy and have operated intelligently to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the world in all the world. Ebbene, onorevole Impeliteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, è con questa fede che noi lavoriamo, perché le libertà democratiche siano veramente estese a tutto il mondo e vi sia pace e lavoro per tutti. Non è facile il nostro compito. Forse talvolta noi italiani non siamo compresi. Bisogna ricordare che la ricostruzione della democrazia in Italia è avvenuta proprio nel momento in cui noi eravamo gravati dal peso della sconfitta. Città care avevamo perduto. Territori nei quali il nostro lavoro poteva espletarsi. Miserie e rovine, ma l'attaccamento a questa forza, l'attaccamento a questa fede democratica era così vivo che noi abbiamo ripreso il nostro lavoro. Abbiamo lavorato, lavoriamo, disperatamente lavoriamo per ricostruire moralmente e materialmente il nostro paese. E' con questi sentimenti, onorevole Impeliteri, che io saluto lei e la città di New York e le dico che siamo tenaci nell'opera di ricostruzione della democrazia nel nostro paese. Siamo tenaci e abbiamo degli esempi. Abbiamo degli esempi soprattutto a Genova. La tenacia di Colombo nel ricercare la vostra terra è un esempio a tutti i genovesi. E' un esempio, deriso, non creduto, contrastato da ogni avversità dagli uomini e dagli avvenimenti. Quest'uomo sapeva che questa grande terra esisteva e l'ha cercata disperatamente. E' andato assondando alle foci dei fiumi. E' andato cercando negli estuari, ovunque, cercando quel passaggio che lui voleva trovare per congiungere tutto il mondo sotto la croce cristiana? Ebbene, non importa se lui poi non ha trovato il passaggio. Non importa se ognuno di noi non trova il passaggio. Bisogna persistere altri, troverà la strada. La strada perché tutto il mondo sia libero in pace e nel lavoro. Il nostro paese di fare l'interprete le parole del Presidente. Il nostro paese di fare l'interprete le parole del Presidente. Il nostro paese di New York, ci sono certi atti e dei che hanno una significazione in loro, e ci sono atti e dei che hanno un significato molto speciale. Il nostro paese di Genoa, il nostro paese di Genoa, è stato uno di quei atti che hanno una significazione speciale. Il nostro paese di non solo visitato la città di Colombo, ma venivano a nostra città di un'ambassadore di New York e di un'ambassadore di Stati.

You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great man which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indies. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win.
