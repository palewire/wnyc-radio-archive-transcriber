Don't hear the sound, don't hear the sound. They're ringing out the glory of the day. Don't hear them through theirwaÄ‡. Don't hear them through their sabor. They're ringing out the glory of today. Hear them bells, don't hear them bells. Don't hear them bells, don't hear them bells. Give them bells, give them bells, bring it up to the glory of God. The End Two little girls in blue, lad, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad, two, one, your father's home. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted above. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I do. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Comrades, when men was born, they blew their eyes behind. When they just read us, my darling old comrade, what's there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken. And a mother's heart has broken. There is just another thing. From the old home that we've all. There is still a memory living. There's a father unforgiving. And a picture that is true. Hold the wall. She's my sweetheart. I'm her moan. She's my honey. I'm her joe. Good wheel rally. Never to pass. With her honey to me. Give my sweetheart. One evening in the month of May. Donny, get the gun, get the gun. I met old Satan on the way. Donny, get the gun, get the gun. I looked old Satan in the eye. Donny, get the gun, get the gun. If you want to get to heaven when you die. Donny, get the gun, get the gun. Donny, get the gun, get the gun. You'll bear on the way. Donny, get the gun, get the gun. Donny, get the gun, get the gun. Good boy. Donny, get the gun. Go it now. Blocking on. Go it now. Go it now. Go it now. Try to get your gun, get your gun. Go it now. Go it now. Go. Go it now. Go it now. Go it now. Go get your gun. Get your gun. Go it now. Johnny, get the gun, get the gun! The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End
