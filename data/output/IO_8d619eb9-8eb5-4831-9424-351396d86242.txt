Ladies and gentlemen and children, although I am not in your midst today, I want all of you to know that you are in my thoughts, and through the medium of radio, I am extending to all of the people of the city of New York, and especially the children, my very best wishes for a Merry Christmas. This is a traditional period of good cheer and happiness, and I think each of us, were we to extend ourselves just a little bit to bring a bright shaft of joy into the life of one of our less fortunate neighbors, whether here or abroad, we would experience that delicate and satisfying thrill that comes to everyone who practices the simple lesson in charity and love. Ladies and gentlemen and children, a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to all of you. Thank you.
