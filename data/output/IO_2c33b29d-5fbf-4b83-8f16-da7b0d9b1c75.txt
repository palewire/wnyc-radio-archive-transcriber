Here the tramples, Saxon-Holmen, Saxon-Spearmen, Saxon-Holmen. Be they night behind the yeomen, they they fight the ground. To the fall of thunder, flag we conquer under. The land that tries, the sky's the sky, the world is under. From which is our country needs us, he is brave as he who leads us. On excel, how proud he has done. Freedom, love, and rise. The sea's the past and narrow, flash with fear and slight of arrow. Fluid danger of death or sorrow, death is glory now. Earl the reeling parchment over, let the earth's end, oh, and cover. When a friend, a wife, a lover, crevled on the floor. And of life are written, love for glory given. And then you're not seeing a birthday and living to heaven. You man of politics, young authority, would you win a name in story. Cry for all, for life, for glory. Freedom, love, and rise. For their third and concluding number, the Glee Club presents Benny Havens. A ballad sung by sons of West Point for over a hundred years. And sung today wherever West Pointers gather. Come fill your glasses alone And stand up in the row To singing sentimentally We're going for to go In the army there so dry at sea From motion very slow So we'll sing our grand millicenters Of Benny Havens' home To our kind old laddie Of Benny Havens' home To our kind old laddie Of Benny Havens' home We'll sing our grand millicenters Of Benny Havens' home To our kind old laddie Of Benny Havens' home To our kind old alma mater Our rock-bound island home We'll tell Blacksmen Upon regret As for life's feet we roam Until the light of heaven The light of heaven Shall flow Till never fail To drink to earth And Benny Havens' home And Benny Havens' home And Benny Havens' home And Benny Havens' home Oh Benny Havens' home We'll sing our grand millicenters Of Benny Havens' home And our grand millicenters Of Benny Havens' home And our grand millicenters Of Benny Havens' home May the army be augmented So more guns be let's flow May our country May our country In the hour of need Be ready for the fall May our country In the hour of need Be ready for the fall May the time that soldiers Let them face me The soldiers' home We're grooming all In the hour of need To be ready for the fall We're grooming all In thy heart's pain For Benny Havens' home For Benny Havens' home Oh Benny Havens' home We'll sing our grand millicenters Of Benny Havens' home From West Point, we conclude this quarter hour of song By the Cadet Glee Club Conducted by Cadet G.S.

Fisher Pianist On Tuesday, June 4th At 10 a.m. The address of Secretary of War Patterson To the graduating class Will be broadcast Over station WNYC This is Major Bill Hood Speaking And returning you to the studios Of the Municipal Broadcasting System Broadcasting System From everyone to this piece May we introduce Pete McGinnis Now what do you think of anything Being 300 years old, Pete? Well, I want to let my good friends know That there's been 300 years of royal welcome That we have in the borough of Brooklyn And in this borough We have gathered many tongues Of many nations all over the world And we live all happy together No matter what race we come to No matter what our religion is God has given us that feeling That we shall continue to love one another Irrespective of our religion, our politics As long as we are all good fellows together I say in this great borough In 300 years It has developed And it's been a thing Of an inspiration For the whole world Those that have never had the chance To see our great borough Highly come here To see our tall buildings Our great manufacturers Our many things of the interest That help supply the good things All over the world Oh, people When the opportunity comes to you Kindly visit our borough We are the borough Of good-hearted people Good-natured people No drive was ever started In the borough of Brooklyn That ever fell down This borough has been generous in everything War front drives Red Cross drives War front drives Cancer drives And many, many others Because the people of Brooklyn Were always generous And they give They give them out To this hunger famine All over the world And I hope the world in return Won't take advantage of us As has been done on many occasions But love and a joy The friendship Not alone of the borough of Brooklyn But the good people That come from all parts of the country To make our country what it is today And Brooklyn is one of the springs in our country That has developed And we in Brooklyn are very, very proud That we are residents of this borough I thank you Now Pete, you've committed a grave error You haven't said a word about Greenpoint Well I wanted to be a little modest I want to feel this way That to me Greenpoint is a bit more You haven't said a word about Greenpoint Well I wanted to be a little modest I want to feel this way I want to feel this way, that to me Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world. It is a spot where I was raised and first seen the light of day at number 132 Eagle Street. Thanks be to God there was a Greenpoint. Thanks be to God that the light of day gave me my opportunity. And to the people of Greenpoint I worked and worked the same as every other man and labored on the docks. I pulled lumber, I worked in the whole of business. I'm proud to tell you I was a long shaman. I'm delighted to say that I work with men and I've done the same thing as every other man done. Work for an honest living and thanks be to God for that. Thanks. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look as we said before at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time Mr. President? Alright surely I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building housing a borough president. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836. And then a depression set in and it lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected in 1848. That building was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there on the right hand side that old Arbuckle building. That's coming down and we're going to build $11.5 million Kings County Supreme Court building. Then you go down a little further and we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building we're still going to keep there and we're going to renovate that and use it there. We're out of a car. I don't know what it is. Thanks a lot. We're here at Brooklyn at Borough Hall. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look as we said before at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time Mr. President? All right, surely I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building housing a Borough president. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836. And then a depression set in and it lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected in 1848. That was when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down and we're going to build $11.5 million, Kings County Supreme Court building. When you go down a little further, we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there and we're going to renovate that and use it for a federal court. This whole Brooklyn Civic Center is going to be flanked on both sides by public buildings. And right in the center of it, it's going to be a war memorial. And it's going to be a useful one instead of brick, lime, lumber and cement. It's going to be an honor of the 327,000 boys and girls who fought in this war. And don't forget, Brooklyn supplied more. And that 327,000, the many of 39 states in the Union. In this war memorial, you're going to have an auditorium that holds 1,500 people. And then you're going to have a room on the right where the trophies that our boys captured from the four corners of the world are going to be on display. And on the left-hand side is going to be a room in bronze where the names will be inscribed of every boy and girl who made the supreme sacrifice. And downstairs, this is very interesting, and I believe you'll like it. We're going to have a room for each of the veterans' organizations, which isn't anywhere in the city of New York. We're going to have the American Legion, the King's County, the Spanish War veterans, the Catholic War veterans, and the Jewish War veterans. They're all going to be down there in that one building. So if any of these 327,000 veterans need assistance, they'll have a central location point to which to go. Thank you. I appreciate you very much, Mr. President, your busy life, stepping by this way and taking a few moments. That was quite a celebration you had down with Hamilton Ferry, wasn't it? You want to say a word about that? Yes, that was a big thrill. I'll tell you a little about that. A ferryboat known as the Moran Tugboat Company supplied it as a company. He lives in Brooklyn, and he's a resident. I wonder if we can pick up somebody here, will you? I should say pick up, that's the wrong term. I said, you can go out. I walked across the square with Pete McGinnis. I'm by a very athletic young man. I took hands with him, and he says, how are you? He said, I'm going to go.
