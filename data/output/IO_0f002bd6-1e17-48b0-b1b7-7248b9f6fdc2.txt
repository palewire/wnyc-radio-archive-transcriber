Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, got no mule, I've got no misery. The coast is plenty of plenty, found a lock on the door. Great somebody's a-goin' to rob them without a-make-in-law. What for? What for? I've got a lock on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are on me. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gals, got my gals, got my door, got my door, got my door. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I can't go sun, can't go moon, can't go deep to sea. The coast with plenty of plenty, God will pray all the day. He's got plenty, you're not a warrior, he's the devil away. away, away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of life. never worry long, never worry long, and I'm well, never want to strive to be good, to be bad, what the hell, why is that I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, for heaven, heaven, all day long. Now you complain it. Got my gals, got my gals, got my lords, got my lords, got my lords. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Poggy and Beth.
