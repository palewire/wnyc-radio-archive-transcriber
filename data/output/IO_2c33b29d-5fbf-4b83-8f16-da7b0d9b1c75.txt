Here the tramples, Saxon-Holmen, Saxon-Spearmen, Saxon-Holmen. Be they night behind the yeomen, they they fight the ground. To the fall of thunder, flag we conquer under. The land that tries, the sky's the sky, the world is under. From which is our country needs us, he is brave as he who leads us. On excel, how proud he has done. Freedom, love, and rise. The sea's the past and narrow, flash with fear and slight of arrow. Fluid danger of death or sorrow, death is glory now. Earl the reeling parchment over, let the earth's end, oh, and cover. When a friend, a wife, a lover, crevled on the floor. And of life are written, love for glory given. And then you're not seeing a birthday and living to heaven. You man of politics, young authority, would you win a name in story. Cry for all, for life, for glory. Freedom, love, and rise. For their third and concluding number, the Glee Club presents Benny Havens. A ballad sung by sons of West Point for over a hundred years. And sung today wherever West Pointers gather. Come fill your glasses alone And stand up in the row To singing sentimentally We're going for to go In the army there so dry at sea From motion very slow So we'll sing our grand millicenters Of Benny Havens' home Of Benny Havens' home We'll sing our reminiscence Of Benny Havens' home To our kind old alma mater Our rock-bound island home We'll tell Blacksmen Upon regret As for life's feet we roam Until a night's battle's feet The lights of heaven will show The lights of heaven will show Till you never fail To break to earth And Benny Havens' home And many havens fall O, many havens fall O, many havens fall We'll sing our grand meldons there O, many havens fall May the army be augmented So more than sea let's flow May our country in the hour of need Be ready for the fall May the time of those who let you And see the chosen road We're strobing love In thy heart's name For many havens fall O, many havens fall O, many havens fall We'll sing our grand meldons there O, many havens fall O, many havens fall From West Point we conclude this quarter hour of song by the Cadet Glee Club Conducted by Cadet G.S. Harper with Warrant Officer Barry Drews in charge And Cadet W.S. Fisher, pianist On Tuesday, June 4th at 10 a.m. The address of Secretary of War Patterson to the graduating class will be broadcast over station WNYC This is Major Bill Hood speaking and returning you to the studios of the Municipal Broadcasting System Last February 29th Welcome the years of welcome we have in Brooklyn. In this village, many nations gather the songs of the world. We live all together happy. No matter what race we come to, no matter what our religion is, God has given us that we will continue to love each other, in respect of our religion and our politics, as long as we are good friends together. I say in this great borough, in 300 years, it has developed and has been an inspiration for the whole world. Those who have never had the chance to see our great borough, finally come here to see our tall buildings, our great manufacturers, our many things of the interest that help supply the good things all over the world. Oh, people, when the opportunity comes to you, kindly visit our borough. We are the borough of good-hearted people, good-natured people. No drive was ever started in the borough of Brooklyn that ever fell down. This borough has been generous in everything. War front drives, Red Cross drives, War front drives, cancer drives, and many, many others, because the people of Brooklyn were always generous. And they give, they give them now to this hunger famine all over the world. And I hope the world in return won't take as advantage of ours, as has been done on many occasions, but love and enjoy the friendship, not alone of the borough of Brooklyn, but the good people that come from all parts of the world to make our country what it is today. And Brooklyn is one of the springs in our country that has developed. And we in Brooklyn are very, very proud that we are residents of this borough. I thank you. Now, Pete, you've committed a grave error. You haven't said a word about Greenpoint. Well, I wanted to be a little modest. I want to feel this way, that to me, Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world. It is a spot where I was raised and first seen the light of day at number 132 Eagle Street. Thanks be to God there was a Greenpoint. Thanks be to God that the light of day gave me my opportunity. And to the people of Greenpoint, I worked and worked the same as every other man, and labored on the docks. I pulled lumber. I worked in the whole of business. I'm proud of that I was a long shaman. I'm delighted to say that I worked with men, and I've done the same thing as every other man done. Worked for an honest living, and thanks be to God for that. As we stand here and look down historic Booton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak for a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more, and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building, housing a borough president. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836, and then a depression set in. It lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected in 1848. That's when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land, which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there, on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down, and we're going to build $11.5 million, Kings County Supreme Court building. Then you go down a little further, and we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there, and we're going to renovate that and use it there. We're out of a car. Another one of these. Thanks a lot. We're here at Brooklyn, at Borough Hall. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old, just two years more, and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building housing of Borough President. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836, and then a depression set in. It lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years, and then the building was finally erected in 1848. That was when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land, and then the building was built in the building. We paid $3,600,000. Over there on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down, and we're going to build $11.5 million, Kings County Supreme Court building. When you go down a little further, we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there, and we're going to renovate that and use it for a federal court. This whole Brooklyn Civic Center is going to be flanked on both sides by public buildings, and right in the center of it, it's going to be a war memorial, and it's going to be a useful one instead of brick, lime, lumber, and cement. It's going to be in honor of the 327,000 boys and girls who fought in this war. And don't forget, Brooklyn supplied more in that 327,000, and the many of 39 states in the Union. In this war memorial, you're going to have an auditorium that holds 1,500 people. And then you're going to have a room on the right where the trophies that our boys captured from the four corners of the world are going to be on display. And then on the left-hand side is going to be a room in bronze where the names will be inscribed of every boy and girl who made the supreme sacrifice. And downstairs, this is very interesting, and I believe you'll like it. We're going to have a room for each of the veterans' organizations, which isn't anywhere in the city of New York. We're going to have the American Legion, the King's County, the Spanish War veterans, the Catholic War veterans, and the Jewish War veterans. They're all going to be down there in that one building. So if any of these 327,000 veterans need assistance, they'll have a central location point to which to go. Thank you. I appreciate you very much, Mr. President, your busy life stepping by this way and taking a few moments. That was quite a celebration you had down with Hamilton Ferry, wasn't it? You want to say a word about that? Yes, that was a big thrill. I'll tell you a little about that. A ferry boat known as the Moran Tugboat Company supplied it as a company. Well, he lives in Brooklyn, and he's a resident. I wonder if we can pick up somebody here, will you? I should say pick up, that's the wrong term. You come out, I was walking across the square with Pete McGinnis, and I'm by a very athletic young man took hands with him, and he says, how are you, he says?
