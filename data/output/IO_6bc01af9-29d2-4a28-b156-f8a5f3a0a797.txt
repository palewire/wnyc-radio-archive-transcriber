Whenever it occurred in history that a musical genius combined his artistry with diplomacy in its most dignified and human sense, then it was Ignac Paderewski, the great Polish pianist and statesman who might be called the ideal personification of that rare, if not unique, combination. His life was a constant strive for realizing and maintaining of the highest level of those ideals. He sacrificed his art for the sacred aim of Poland's independence. Art was his diplomacy and diplomacy became his art. With the outbreak of First World War, Paderewski devoted himself entirely to the cause of Poland. In 1915, he came to the United States and made personal appeals at all his concerts and delivered more than 300 speeches for the cause of an independent Poland. He persistently and entirely worked on the idea of placing his country's claim before the Allies, namely that Poland should be created as an independent state and with a Western frontier so established that she would be secured against possible German aggression. In 1919, he became Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the first government of independent Poland. But afterwards, his artistic mission called him back to his beloved art. When the Second World War broke out and his country became invaded and occupied, he devoted again every of his efforts to support and defend the cause of Polish independence. As he said it, how happy I would be if I could again make a tribute to a splendid victory. Death interrupted his efforts to fight for a new independent Poland with her historical frontiers extended to the Oder and Neisi rivers. For Poland, however, he will remain an eternal symbol not only of the continuance of great Polish music traditions, but also a symbol of complete devotion to patriotic ideals. For the Polish and the American people, he will also remain a symbol of true and sincere Polish-American friendship.
