Pray somebody's a-goin' to rob them out without a-make-in-law. What for, what for? I got a lot on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that'll pay the fee. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I got my gal, got my son, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my dog. Do you complain it? I got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I got the sun, got the moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of plenty, got to pray all the day. Keep the plenty, don't worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of ride. Never want me long, and I'm well. Never want me strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell, are you glad I'm the Lord? I got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I got my gal, got my dog, for heaven's a whole day long.
