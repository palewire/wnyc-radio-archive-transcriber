When you walk by a war bond, remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the boys overseas are giving their lives. You are only asked to lend your money. And on this theme, your city station microphones are set up at 29th Street and 7th Avenue on the southwest corner to bring you the ceremonies of the war bond rally of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry. Among the notable speakers to be heard will include our own mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Fiorello H. Ligardia. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Henry H. Engel, who is chairman of this rally. Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a privilege to present a great singing star who has graciously consented to be with us at this monster war bond rally. She has sung with the Metropolitan Opera Company, the San Francisco Opera Company, and is now one of the stars of that smash hit operetta, Rosalinda. It gives me great pleasure to present Miss Jean Merrill, who will sing our national anthem. The National Anthem. Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what some road be we here. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. The National Anthem. Gave proof through the night that our faith was still there. Oh, say, God, God's kingdom, and who is there? And the love of the brave. Thank you, Miss Merrill. And now, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of this rally, I wish to present the chairman of the War Bond Committee of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry, Mr. George I. Fox. Ladies and gentlemen of the fur industry, I welcome you as chairman of the Bond Committee of the Fur Industry to this rally, which marks the opening of the greatest drive of the nation. The nation has attempted to raise a huge sum of $13 billion for the support of our boys in the field. The fur trade has pledged itself to participate to the extent of $10 million in bond stores this drive. I'm sure that every one of us, both employers and employees alike, will do their share in participating in this privilege, to share in the fight for freedom, democracy, and until victory is ours. I know the fur trade, then, will all to a man, will come along and not wait to be approached and coached to participate in this privilege. You will come along from your own free will, and buy bonds as much as you can, so that we can share in the effort until the Nazis and the fascists have been wiped off the earth. We have a very elaborate program prepared for you. We have some nationally known singers and some well-known speakers, among whom our very beloved mayor, the Honorable Fiorello Lagaria, will speak to you in a little while. And now I'm going to introduce to you a young man who will take over to this master of ceremonies on this occasion, a man who is a nationally known artist, both on stage and screen, who has just come back from the coast, where he has entertained 195 camps. He is also appearing on the Campbell's program each Wednesday night. He is the star of the Siegfeld Follies. He is a man who gives of himself at all times that he is ever called upon to perform a duty for patriotic services and for very charitable causes. I give you the very fast-approaching number one comedian of the United States, our very beloved Milton Berle. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Fox, it's a wonderful announcement for a skin dealer. I'm very glad to be here today, ladies and gentlemen, on this wonderful rally. It's very nice and warm out here. I should have worn my silver fox earmuffs today. But I want to tell you... Pardon me, I just got up. It's a pleasure and a privilege, really. On behalf of the fur industry, and I'd like to be half of the fur industry, it's really a thrill to be up here on this rostrum with all these... I guess all you ladies and gentlemen in this very vast audience are wondering who these very, very gorgeous-looking ladies are here with the roses in their hands. May I say that these ladies, I'd like to introduce them, have them stand up and take a bow, they're all mothers of all the boys from the fur industry that are seeing service. Let's give them a swell hand. Here they are. Thank you very much, ladies. Thank you. You look very, very pretty. Very. I want to tell you that everybody's going to be here. The mayor, Mayor LaGuardia, was supposed to be here a little earlier, but he's tied up. He's playing bingo up in 48th Street, you see. If he's here, I'm kidding, Fiorella. But I... Everybody, in fact, you know, the reason I'm here for another reason, I... I... Very, very glad to be with... I have a brother. Mr. Fox, you can sit down. We saw your coat. Looks all right. Looks... Gets up and shows his coat. And, uh... Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf? I.J. Fox. I, um... No, pardon me. I mean George Fox. But it is really, uh... My brother's in the fur industry. He's a caracal curler. Got a wonderful job. You know how you, uh, curl caracal. They're curled already. Do I have to explain the jokes here today? But I want to tell you, it's really very, very, uh... A big thrill, ladies and gentlemen, really, to be up in this pond. I don't know. There is very... In fact, uh... Eleanor Roosevelt was supposed to be here, but it was too near. And, uh... I'm a little tired out. I've been ironing all day and forging my ration card. And I want to tell you, it, uh... This is like trying to get laughs in a murder trial. Will you relax? Laugh when the world laughs with you. Try and they put you on a good will. I want to tell you... It's very, very difficult trying to get laughs when there's subway going underneath you here. But I want to tell you that I would like to introduce... I would like. I would like to go back to sleep. I would like to introduce... I'm really... I'm tired, really. I'm very happy, though, today. It's my anniversary. I've been married a year today. I don't know what to get my wife. She wants a man. I, uh... Oh, now you laugh. I like that our New York Finest, all these very fine policemen, are doing a wonderful job here this afternoon. I want, I think, a swell hand for the New York's Finest boys. Let's give... Let's give all the boys a hand. Except the guy up on 34th Street wouldn't let me through. And if he can hear me, I mean it. He's a... He's a Harvard man. And, uh... No, all kidding aside, all these fellas... I played a cop in my last picture. I made a picture called Margin for Error. Who saw the picture? Anybody see it? Three, four, five. Thank you. You did. Hello, Ben. I'm glad to see you. Ben Platt's here. I guess he wants me to mention his name. I mentioned it. Now you go back to your store. All right. I played a cop in that picture, and I had the most important part in that picture in Margin for Error. Joan Bennett, she's in the picture, too, and I have the most important part. At the beginning of the picture, I open the door and let Joan Bennett in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. That's the end of the joke. What do you want, gasoline? Relax. May I present... May I present as our first surprise, ladies and gentlemen... May I present as our first surprise some kids from CCNY waving to me over there. How are you, kid? Fine, how are you? Playing hooky, huh? May I present four boys, ladies and gentlemen... that are from our very fine United States Coast Guard, and all of them have seen action and fighting. One gentleman who was the head of the Southerners, Mr. Homer Smith. You've heard on the Columbia Broadcasting System, and he's gathered all these boys and formed the Coast Guard Quartet, which is one of the finest singing quartets in the service. Now, the fellow members of the quartet are Miss James Lewis, Thomas Lockhart, Martin Bowen, with Frank Boyle at the piano. Now, Homer, suppose you take over and tell him what we're going to do. Where's Homer? All right, Homer. Ladies and gentlemen, Homer Smith. A swell hand for Homer Smith. Thank you. Oh, yeah, I know you, Homer. How's everything? All right. We're supposed to say the fuck to you out there at Manhattan Beach. We're waiting. Yeah, we're out at Manhattan Beach together. We did that big benefit out there. That was the opening.

While the hearts are yearning Though the lands be far away They dream of home There's a silver lining Through the dark clouds shining Turn the dark clouds inside out Till the boys come home There's a

don't always use The right word I want you to know that At least It comes from the bottom Of my heart I'm an American citizen now And I'm very proud of it I'm married to an American citizen You know who he is And I'm very proud of it too But I was born in France In Paris And coming from Europe As I suppose many of you did And you have some of your family And some of your parents over there You know all how much They are waiting For the American soldiers to arrive So what we are going to try To do today And every day Is to try to hurry that day Of freedom For all those poor countries over there And for that we need more guns And more tanks And more planes And for that we need Every penny we can give Because A little while ago 15 or 16 months ago We were asked to buy Defense bonds And that was wonderful We had to defend ourselves And we wanted to fight And we were hoping to win But today What you are asked for Is even more exciting Because today We know we are going to win But we want to win quickly And if you can remember that Maybe each time You are going to give a dollar Each time you are going to buy a bond It's going to bring peace Near to us Maybe it's going to save an hour Or one minute So If you think of that When you are going to give the dollar Don't wait an hour Don't wait a minute Don't wait a second But please Please Do it now Thank you Thank you Annabella Thank you Lots of good luck Amara gots to tie After all What has Tyrone Powell got That I haven't got I'm sorry to say But ladies and gentlemen It is my pleasure now To present to you At this time A

White Ladies and gentlemen My friends have often told me That I look 10 years younger With my hat on And I'm sure That I'll feel At least 20 degrees warmer If I can keep my hat on Pardon me Mr. White May I interrupt Were you caught in the hair rain? If I had the humor That our friend Mr. Burl has here I could answer him But if you also had my hair It would be alright The war emergency board Of the fur industry Composed of labor And management organizations In the industry Has done an outstanding job In its war effort activities It has sponsored The previous war bond drive The salvage drive The blood donors drive And through its war chest Recently distributed $250,000 To war relief agencies Of the allied nations The board's greatest gesture Was the creation Of the fur vest project Which is now Of national scope And operation Thousands of fur line vests Have been distributed To brave merchant seamen Of the allied merchant marine And this project Is to be continued Indefinitely To ensure a steady flow Of these vests For the duration of the war This project Was made possible Through the patriotism And generosity Of the fur workers Many of you Within the hearing Of my voice Are giving unstintingly Of your time and labor For this most worthy cause And I'm sure You'll continue to do so We are here today To ask you to make Another contribution But one which will not Require your time Or even effort The United States government Is asking you To put your money Into the finest And safest investment In the world Not only will you receive A good rate of interest And ensure yourself Against poverty And distress In the years to come But these bonds Will pay big dividends In victory Freedom And the peaceful Pursuit of happiness Bring those boys Over there back quicker By backing them up With your dollars Over here And now it is My extreme pleasure To present to you A dynamic personality A real friend Of the fur industry A man who has been Untiring In his duty And devotion To his country And his city His honor The mayor of New York Fiorella La Guardia Mr. Chairman Benny Who said this was A ghost town I wish Some of these employers Were trying to bring back Starvation wages And the sweatshops And Macy's And Bloomingdale's And Abraham and Strauss Could come here And see this ground And incidentally While we're fighting This war We are not going To permit Labor standards To be brought down Now let Bloomingdale And Macy And Abraham and Strauss And Lord and Taylor Take note of that And perhaps Look at their own payrolls And give their employees A better birth You know Ben Gold asked me To come here To make an appeal For this Second war loan And after he asked me To come here And make the appeal He just now told me You're oversubscribed Already And of course I know That the fur industry Will come through As they always do You know As I said last night At Carnegie Hall The matter's very simple We either Loan the money To our government And get it back With interest Or else Hitler and the Japs Will come over here And take it away from us We get nothing And we're not going To let them come over here And that is why We want to make This second war loan Not only successful We want to Oversubscribe it And I am sure That the flourishing Prospering Great industrial town Of New York Will lead the whole procession Now of course We have no illusions About this men It's going to be A long And difficult War There's no doubt As to the outcome But we must do A complete job That means That there is a great deal Of hard and difficult Fighting ahead The news this week Is rather encouraging The French The British And our American troops Are chasing Rummel and his army Into the waters Of the Bay of Tunis The army Of the Soviet Republicans Are pushing back Every attempt Of the Nazi forces To break through Again The Russian army Has now The Nazi army In the mud Up to their knees And pretty soon They'll have them In the mud Up to their necks It wasn't so many weeks ago When Hitler Was making preparations For his march Into Moscow And as I told you At the meeting Madison Square Garden The only time The Nazi army Will see Moscow Will be when they'll be Taken there As prisoners of war And yet As I say There's a great deal More fighting To be done And we have to fight Until We've beaten And crushed And destroyed The Japs Hitler And his little pal Mussolini too None of them Are any good And never were Any good And some of us Knew That They were no good All of the time So I want to Congratulate The fur industry Of New York City Employers And the organized Workers Of the fur industry In getting An early start In this War loan In setting the example To other industries And I know That you'll make good For your country This time As you always Make good This war Is not only For our Protection It's For a Better World To bring About The assurance Of peace And economic Security Not only For our People But for the People Of the entire World Thank you Thank you
