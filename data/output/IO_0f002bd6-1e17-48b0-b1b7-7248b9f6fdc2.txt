And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Bore, accompanist, in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, got no mule, I've got no misery. The coast is plenty of plenty. Down a lock on the door, bring somebody to go and to rob them up without a naked boy. What for? What for? What for? I've got no car, got no car, got no car, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to speak. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are okay. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my tongue, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my dog. I've got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, got my gal. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got the sun, and the moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of plenty, lots of pray all the day. Keeps the plenty, you know how to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, and it's time to rise. Never worry long, and I'm well. Never worry long, and I'm well. Never want to strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell are you glad, I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my tongue, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing from Gershwin's Forgy and Bess.
