Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. Thank you. The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The National Anthem of Italy and the National Anthem of our own country, very brightly played by the New York City Police Department Band. Now here is Mr. Coleman. Yes. Mayor Impoletari, it is my distinct honor and privilege today to present to you and through you, the people of the City of New York, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of Genoa, Italy. Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The Mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. when he was elected mayor of Genoa last year. He defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success and when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scarnie of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And, Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor the City's Gold Medal of Honor on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome looking man accepting the congratulations of the Mayor and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Pertuzio is about six feet two I would say weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. Honorable Honorable Sindaco of New York of New York is with profound commotion that I heard about 5 I'm going to say that I'm going to be the best person and I'm going to be the noble city that I'm going to represent.

So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impeliteri, this visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and to his mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. It is also the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic life and has contributed to it modest to it, it is a salute of this man and the Italian population to the great people of the United States, to the United States, to which we are deeply grateful, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made for us to give us the democratic democratic freedom when we have intervened so potent in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men also, for which we can say today that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of democracy and have operated intelligently for defending democracy in Europe and in all the world.

Sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work, because the democratic democratic freedom is really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For sometimes we Italians don't understand it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just in the moment in which we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. We were told that we would enjoy it in the moment inżyć kinda this country because we have taken hope for everyone, We have been working, but the attack of this force, this democratic faith, was so alive that we have taken our work. We have worked, we have worked, we have worked, we have worked for our country to rebuild our country. It is with these sentiments, on the other side, that I salute you and the city of New York. And I say that we are in the work of the reconstruction of our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genova. The tenacious of Colombo in searching for your country is an example to all the genoveses. Derisier, not credier, contrasting by every man and the events of every man, this man knew that this great country existed and looked at it desperately. And he went to the river and looked at it, and looked at it everywhere, and looked at it everywhere, looking at it, that he wanted to find it for everyone to join the cross. And he said, well, he didn't find it for us, he didn't find it for us, he didn't find it for us, he didn't find it for us, he must persist and others will find the way, the way to find it for everyone to be free, in peace and work.
