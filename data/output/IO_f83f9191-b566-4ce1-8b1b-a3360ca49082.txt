We need still more of their projects. Enjoy your visit to Brooklyn today. I hope that your favorite team wins. Last night I thought I might have the pleasure of watching the Dodgers play. As a matter of fact, I intended to go to the game last night, but as you probably know, we were rained out. I thoroughly hope that you have a very pleasant stay in our city. I look forward to joining you at dinner tonight that will be given by one of our most civic conscious leaders, Mr. Thomas J. Watson. I know that during your stay in our city, you will find that the people of the city of New York reflect the thinking that I have told you about this morning. You will be received warmly. I know that the people of the city of New York will extend every facility at their command so that your visit here will be the kind of visit we hope you will remember when you go back to your homeland. And your royal highness, this morning, it's my great honor and my great privilege to confer upon you on behalf of the people of the city of New York this recognition of your contribution to world peace when I present to you the city's Medal of Honor.

Mr. Mayor, we're going to have the happiness of the return visit of His Majesty and His Royal Highness on their way home. And we wish them the best kind of a trip from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coast, which is in their itinerary. And not to hold up the festivities of the ball game any longer, we will conclude our happy reunion this morning. Thank you very much, one and all, your excellencies, Ambassador Crocker, the Ambassador of the United Nations and the United Nations. I'll give you something. You'll want to be fine. Sorry. Going too clear. Mr. Mayor, it is my pleasure indeed to acknowledge most heartily your kind remarks. You have given me and my friends a hospitality worthy of this great city of New York. This is the first time that I see your metropolis, and I may tell you that it has filled me with admiration. It is one of the wonders of the world, and you have a great task in presiding over its affairs. May I once more thank you and your staff for your kindness and consideration. Thank you. Something stunning. Woah. Amen. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
