Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, athletes who are on your way to San Moritz and to the neighbors' children who are listening in. Neighbors, if you could only be here today and see this fine aggregation of American youth, girls, boys, who are going to leave, who are going to compete for the world's championship, that is, ski championship, on the fifth international Olympic ski championship of the world. They're good, they look well. I'd say they look better than that. They look awfully good. They're going to carry with them on this ship that takes them over. The hopes of all of us that they'll come back victors. This group are a group of young ambassadors of goodwill. They are representative of that thought that exists throughout the world. That great international competitions should be confined to the world of sport. Because in the world of sport there is that manliness. There is that feeling of fair play. That if that were carried into our daily lives throughout the world, we'd never have anything more serious between nations than this healthy, friendly competition. Children on your trip, if you are the best in the world, I hope that you will have all the conditions favorable so that you can prove it. And if you are not the best, I want you to have and be sporting and congratulate the winner. And this I give you. That we love you just as well so long as you do your best. Good luck to you. Thank you very much, Mayor William O'Dwyer. Thank you, Mayor.
