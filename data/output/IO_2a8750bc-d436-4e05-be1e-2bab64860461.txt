Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is your Chairman Johnson E. Fairchild speaking to you from the Great Hall of the Cooper Union. Tonight we continue with our second program under that title of Women. And the subject for discussion tonight is the basic psychological aspects of femininity and masculinity. And as many of you know, our speaker tonight is Dr. William G. Niederland. I should tell some people that I apologize for not being here last week, but you had an extremely interesting and very fine lecture, I believe. I was trying desperately to leave Erie, Pennsylvania, where I was finishing up a short lecture tour, and just couldn't quite make it on time. But I understand that some people have not been here in the Great Hall before, and I would like to just take a moment to, one, welcome you very efficiently, and two, remind you that there's no smoking here, and that unfortunately or fortunately, I think it's probably fortunately from a Democratic point of view, we do not allow what is known as seat saving. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That was an easy way to get a little applause, doctor. I try that again sometime. I appreciate the people who come in here for the first time or two don't realize that, but obviously where we have a situation when it's first come, first served, why we must attempt to adhere to that whenever possible. I'm sure you all understand that situation. I have several minor announcements. One of them is that if you're interested in amateur theatrical, Cooper Union students are presenting three one-act plays here, Riders to the Sea, The Old Ragpicker, and No, Not the Russians. That's the title of the last one-act play. I didn't say that. These three performances are going on Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings, of course free to the public, and if any of you would like to see one of these non-professionally put-on plays, you're cordially invited to come down here. Now when we started this program of women, I will confess to you, I was a little bit worried about whether anybody was interested in hearing anybody else talk about women. And I'm very happy that so many of you are interested in it, but may I call to your attention that on Friday evenings, we have a very nice musical program. This coming Friday, Masterpieces of French Song is the title of a recital given by William Gephardt, a baritone who has just returned from France. He was a Fulbright fellow and scholar, been working in France for this past year, and he will be singing here. And then on Sunday night in the history series, which has really attracted considerable academic attention, you might be interested to know that Bert Loewenberg of Sarah Lawrence is going to speak on the topic of the Boston Tea Party. Well, that is enough of an introduction. I will just very briefly say that the gentleman who is speaking tonight, Dr. William G. Niederland, William G. Niederland has attracted quite a following, some of whom are trying to batter down the door over there. You must understand that we appreciate, we're very happy to have people come, and we're also very sorry when they can't get in, and if it should ever happen to you folks, please remember that it isn't directed against you or you or you. It really isn't. We would like to have all of you in. The good doctor has several hundred people unhappy out on the street this evening. It's a very unfortunate situation. I've introduced this gentleman three times here, and in the course of those three times, I have said just about all of the things that I can think of to say about him. He went to the University of WÃ¼rzburg, the University of Rome in Naples. He's taught in the Philippines and in Florida. He is a practicing psychiatrist and an author, and he has written Man-Made Plague, A Primer of Neurosis, which I have announced before and still announce and think is a very good and very interesting book. Dr. Niederland, a practicing psychiatrist here in New York City, speaking on the basic psychological aspects of femininity and masculinity. Dr. Niederland. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Dr. Fairchild. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a story about a missionary who went to the Indians of Orinoco to teach them the ways of modern civilization. When he came to the fields where they worked and saw the women working there, he remonstrated with the Indians on allowing their women to sow the fields in the blazing sun with infants at their breasts. The Indians felt very bad about his remonstrations and replied, quotes, Father, you don't understand these things and that is why they wex you so. You know that women are accustomed to bear children and that we men are not. When the women sow, the stalks of the maize bear two or three ears. The root of the yucca yields two or three basketful and everything multiplies in proportion. Now why is that? Simply because the women know how to bring force and also know how to make the seed which they sow bring forth. Let them sow then. We men don't know as much about as they do. Unquote. I'm afraid, ladies and gentlemen, I find myself tonight a bit in the position of our missionary who could remonstrate but not sow, who could ask questions but not answer, who as a man who as a man could speak about children but not bear them and who, as a psychiatrist tonight, could study and try to understand some aspects of human nature but cannot change human nature basically. And speaking about human nature, it is an often repeated truism that its understanding is the most difficult task of man, so difficult indeed, that its study has often been dismissed as a mess of contradictory and opposing forces and theories. And tonight, turning from human nature, erratic as it is, to the complexities and sometimes, at least apparently, incomprehensibilities of a woman's nature, well, Dr. Fairchild speaks in his bulletin of seven ladies and six brave men who have been invited here on Tuesday evenings to discuss with you some aspects of womanhood and singling out just me as the first male speaker, as the first of these brave and adventurous men to address you, certainly confers honor and privilege on me. but an honor and a privilege perhaps not entirely devoid of some grave responsibilities and some haunting anxieties, even in a psychiatrist, in the face of an audience prevalently composed of women. You will understand, therefore, that I have come here tonight not without some strong, though repressed, misgivings on my part, and I have come here not to teach you new facts about life, which you anyway know and know well and better than I do, but to remind you that the psychology of the sexes is different. That men and women go differently about the business of living and loving. That love does not mean the same thing to men and women. That sexuality and love have different emotional places in the lives of the sexes. Years of psychiatric and medical experience and practice have shown me how much unhappiness between men and women is due to the lack of understanding, to the lack of comprehension of the relationship of the sexes and to much misunderstanding and vain, futile, and therefore entirely avoidable, though sometimes apparently inevitable, discussion, fighting, difficulties between them. To be sure, women awaken the desires of men and they feel the ache of their own passion in themselves. But when we use words like love and sexuality as if they had the same connotation for men and women, it is well to remember that this is true only in the most superficial sense. the images, fantasies, thoughts, associations, memories, and feelings which go with these words love, sex, eroticism, affection, and so forth, and which the two sexes connect with these words are not the same. It is clear indeed that it must be so because the very intimacy of the experience that accompanies these feelings and fantasies is of a different nature for both sexes, and in our culture the woman is often the first one who becomes painfully aware of these differences. differences. It is well known that many women in our culture have an aversion to being women, a difficulty, an inner antagonism to accept their own womanhood. They suffer temporarily or permanently from the fact that they have been born as females. Hardly ever is this feeling consciously perceived, nor is it ever explicitly expressed and acknowledged. Most often it is rather vaguely experienced as a general sensation of discomfort and uneasiness, as a feeling of uncertainty and discontent that so often transpires through such general statements and complaints as quotes somehow I don't seem to be getting what I should out of life unquote or I feel as if life were passing me by or I have a husband I am devoted to a lovely child a home money pleasure a nice setting in my life and yet I don't know I am not happy all the same. What so often lurks behind such generalization emotions and complaints sometimes accompanied by a feeling of depression moodiness and general discontent and even quite often accompanied by vague and disturbing physical symptoms is frequently nothing but an unconscious flight from femininity those who attended my last lecture here last December or November I believe it was on psychosomatic conditions and ailments will remember that already at that time here and there I injected a few connotations and annotations about this very point telling you at that time that that host of multiple vague and disturbing symptoms beginning from headache and pressure on the head to nausea and dizziness and other complaints all through the body including indigestion and aches and muscular aches and pains and so forth that these psychosomatic symptoms and manifestations for which so often no physical basis can be found with all the x-ray tests and blood chemistry and other methods of modern medicine that we have come to understand many of these vague and disturbing and sometimes lifelong complaints aches and pains as physical expression of certain emotional emotionally and psychologically disturbing inner mental processes which we call emotional conflicts and one of the basic emotional conflicts in the modern woman is her frequent struggle within herself to accept her own femininity and to reconcile herself to the facts of her own womanhood I have here with me tonight a few case histories psychiatric case histories or rather excerpts very mild excerpts of very mild case histories which I have taken along with me to illustrate to you later some of these theoretical facts and findings which I just pointed out and which I hasten now to illustrate in greater detail not right now in the form of case histories which I hope to have the time to go into later but now into the form of certain facts and manifestations of female life as they appear to us psychiatrists when we put these complaints and these difficulties and problems under the microscope of psychoanalytic exploration just as the bacteriologist for instance or the pathologist has certain physical changes in the organ chemistry or in the organ tissues to examine and put them under the microscope in the form of slides we analysts are not quite as well off we have to use our the microscope of our understanding so to speak of our psychoanalytic insight and psychoanalytic mental exploration not being able to use for these intangible invisible mental things of course a microscope as such as the bacteriologist or pathologist does the difficulties modern woman so often has in accepting her own femininity usually start rather early in life quite often in early childhood when for instance the little girl already has certain difficulties in seeing herself as a girl and wants to be a boy and then in real life acts out her wish of wanting to be a boy namely by playing the role of a tomboy doing everything and anything exactly as the boys do and even more so trying to become in competing and in emulating a boy's behavior more boyish more active and sometimes even more difficult to manage than a boy wild unruly climbing trees doing all sorts of things which a tomboy does then in puberty in adolescence when the girl grows up and even today still in modern homes sometimes is exposed to the admonition on the part of her mother to behave to remember that she is a girl that certain behavior patterns are expected from her which go with this with modern civilized concepts of womanhood and ladylike behavior and when these admonitions become stronger and more outspoken and sometimes are being put on a somewhat critical warning cautioning level telling for instance mothers for instance telling their daughters that women are just pleasure toys for men that women should beware of men who consider them as pleasure toys and would treat them as such well who wants to be a pleasure toy the daughter will not only become aware of certain methods of cautiousness reluctance and so forth but will get to understand within herself that she has not all the freedom all the lustiness all the open mindedness which are considered even in our modern world the privilege the prerogative of man and when then in the home atmosphere with the average with her in the routine of daily life so often the fact is brought closer to the female child and female adolescence that she is living in a man's world as the saying goes it will become increasingly difficult for some of them to accept this fact to reconcile herself to this man's world and certain inattendances may awaken to fight against such a state of things of affairs to rebel against it and to develop an inner antagonism against these things so conceived it is important here to remember that many of these statements and teachings and precepts and examples set in the home of the young female are not always the facts the actual facts of reality and life but are the facts as they reflect themselves in the mind of our pace setters of fathers mothers older sisters older friends teachers and so forth and sometimes these facts by going through the medium of the mind and deflecting themselves there can become so distorted so completely changed that they have hardly anything in common anymore with reality as such certain linguistic expressions in our daily language are here of great interest because they show us exactly by the acceptance and the use of these common linguistic expressions what is going on underneath in the mind of those people who use them for instance one of the woman's most important functions physical and psychological functions in life of course is her innate periodicity which makes her a woman when the child in the growing up goes through the puberty and develops these periodic monthly manifestations which are called the menses then we know here the female child is developing into womanhood and what happens using for our understanding this linguistic key of which I spoke before this very fact as you all know a perfectly normal healthy natural inherent fact which makes a woman a woman for a certain period of life is called by so many even in our times today the curse the curse implying though not consciously that this very periodicity this very basic womanly function is somehow conceived as something with which one is cursed to carry it through life something bad something evil something shameful something horrible and indeed the expression the curse is only here so to speak the key word and I am sure those who had just a good laugh will become perhaps a little bit more thoughtful when they think how many complaints how many disturbances headaches and fatigue and irritability and so forth are associated with this very periodicity and not as it was thought of and as most of you so much like to believe because it must be that way because there's something physical and glandular bad happens and therefore one has a headache because the glands don't do the job as they should or because every month one gets fatigued because of the loss of the hemorrhage the loss of blood and so forth all this has been discarded as fallacious and erroneous by modern research and it has been found that these multiple complaints recurring every month in women who suffer from that often not always but often is nothing but the physical expression of the inner non-acceptance of the unconscious repudiation of this periodicity namely of womanhood this is one of the basic and perhaps most decisive discoveries in modern psychiatry that by analyzing the minds of women who suffer every month from this recurrent depression and headache and migraine and bellyache and other things that analyzing these minds one finds underneath that they don't want it which is quite understandable to some extent but they don't want it because they reject it because they are discontent because they are resentful to be born as females and have to go through this recurrent event month by month this does not rule out that also certain physical changes and physical complaints occur for physical reasons as it is always the case in psychosomatic conditions and as I try to show you in my lecture on psychosomatics that certain physical facts like a stomach ulcer for instance which is certainly a physical thing a lesion in the stomach wall or certain other physical facts like high blood pressure like heart ailments many cases of asthma many types of skin conditions and so forth certainly all physical manifestations are brought about by an unconscious underlying very often deep rooted but completely overlooked mental conflict inner conflict which is raging in the minds of people suffering from stomach ulcers from high blood pressure from asthma from skin condition and also from these periodic complaints at monthly intervals all this becomes even more visible when we come to the highlights of a woman's life for instance pregnancy certainly one of the great pregnancy and childbirth greatest facts in life probably the greatest because by this fact life continues life is propagated without it we wouldn't be sitting here there would be no human beings no living beings at all and when it comes to the highlights of a woman's life for instance pregnancy as so often happens as soon as this fact becomes known to a woman's friends they immediately begin setting the stage how horribly she will feel from now on how bad a period she will have what terrible dangers are in store waiting for her and what all she will go through during these months of pregnancy and thus often strengthening in the woman the sometimes present unconscious rejection of the child and of the husband of course who is responsible for it when it all comes down are five or six emotional factors which can be summarized as follows first dislike more or less intense of being a woman this dislike can in extreme cases go to clinical psychiatric states of severe depression and complete repudiation of womanhood with the abhorrence of every situation which reminds such a woman of her femininity for instance menses pregnancy childbirth courtship menopause and other perfectly normal and natural events of her life I spoke already of the premenstrual and menstrual depression and irritability and feelings of physical symptoms and so forth before however and I have to remind you at this point that you have come to listen to a psychiatrist tonight and we psychiatrists are duty bound to tell our patients the truth and our audiences the truth just as we expect our patients to tell us the full truth and you know that one of the analytic or the basic analytic rule is that while the patient is an analyst he must tell everything everything what comes into his mind and that gives us a possibility to explore what is really going on in the mind not only to say the acceptable socially permissible things but especially those things which are habitually repressed kept down and never expressed in psychiatry they come to the fore and so when one analyzes women who suffer for instance from recurrent depression and I'm not talking now necessarily of menstrual and premenstrual depressive states one finds a number depressive of highly disturbing and at the same time striking facts which are not often discussed in lectures and even rarely written up in books one finds for instance depressive states usually of a very temporary fleeting character in women and quite a number of them after the completion of the physical union the so called post coital depression and when one analyzes why does a person become depressed and resentful or aloof at least after just one of the highest and according to the textbook most gratifying experiences in human life the physical union was experienced between two human beings and they should now rejoice in their mutual happiness and warmth and tenderness and should continue when the very act is over in their tenderness in their warmth in their mutual exchange of careness love and affection and when one finds that very often but not so very often thanks god but sometimes the opposite takes place that people become angry at each other and start fighting and bickering or at least resenting each other and when one analyzes facts one finds that a woman who has not reconciled herself to the acceptance of her own femininity undergoes three or four mental stages in such a fleeting depression first of all she resents the man because he made her yield by his wooing by his approach and she becomes resentful of that then she resents herself because she yielded to his wooing and is angry at herself that she gave in to his insistence and his physical approach as the third stage in such a marital life may occur then a physical an act realistic expression of the inner resentment of the unconscious resentment without being aware of it because she immediately after the completion of the physical union separates herself and does it as if nothing had happened and starts reading the Saturday Evening Post for instance or smoking a cigarette in order to deny the fact that something basically penetrating something something gripping and something important has happened it is pushed aside and undone by such sensical or nonsensical acts like reading or writing or becoming disinterested in other ways in the very thing that just has happened and when it goes further of course when the anger the resentment the disinclination to acknowledge that she is a woman and what would be a greater acknowledgement than the fact of giving warmth of yielding of giving in then comes the refusal the next time the disinclination the repudiation of the union as such why just these depressive states develop for instance in the periodic monthly periods or during pregnancy or in childbirth or following childbirth and I have to say a word about that presently or in the type of postcoital depression which I just outlined for you we also now know why it occurs then because all these physical and emotional facts which just then go on at that time so outspokenly so realistically so undeniably awaken as it were mobilize in the woman her original repudiation of womanhood when she was a tomboy when she even expressed her wish to be a boy and said so and was angry to be born as a woman and then in all these typically feminine manifestations of life is recurrently reminded that she is a woman the very fact she dislikes she resents she repudiates unconsciously and sometimes quite consciously the second factor here at play is the hostile reaction toward her female role in life especially her female sexual role of which I spoke as evidenced also by the well-known fact of frigidity frigidity has nothing to do with the glands and nothing to do with the ovaries and the womb and so forth but frigidity as we know is always a mental fact an emotional condition sometimes so severe that it is a very serious emotional illness and means in a somewhat oversimplified form I am disinterested in playing the sexual role of a woman I am not part of this whole thing I do not participate in it I remain frigid this whole thing marital life physical love and so forth these are all beastly animal male prerogatives belonging to the male beast and I do not participate in it that is the basic although in my words considerably considerably oversimplified psychology of a state of rigidity which brings so frequently unhappiness and misery to married people but the hostile reaction toward the woman's female role in life is not limited to all these things it goes further it leads for instance in certain women to the deprecation of all female trends you all know women who lack warmth tenderness delicacy sweetness who want to embark on a career not because economic conditions always force them there are also such women but because they find that they don't want to have a home life they want to become presiding judges of the supreme court or they want to become executives in big steel corporations or other agencies now there's nothing wrong about that why not that is her own freedom to choose that but she should at least be aware that such a woman embarking on these ambitious and over ambitious careers by that relinquishes voluntarily on her own her interest in female in feminine manifestations and when you see for instance a police woman nothing against them they are very brave and good and we need them but when you analyze them you will find of course little womanhood in her she will find little warmth and understanding and comprehension and conciliatory outgoing faculties this after all seems to me the greatness of womanhood besides being the homemaker and the procreator the propagator by pregnancy and child birth of mankind but the giver the giver of warmth of sweetness of affection of love of understanding the multiplier and promoter of all these important intangible and so often lacking facts in our life today and when you then analyze these women and find that there is little warmth and no love and no tenderness and little affection perhaps there was one in the early adolescence or so it's all gone then you find that basically they repudiate womanhood they want to be harsh and callous and demanding and commandeering and domineering because basically they want to be men and not women it is as we call it in psychiatry the woman's flight into masculinity and in severe clinical cases then going on to the complete relinquishment from from any womanly part in marital sexual and other social life and the flight into homosexuality that is usually then the tragic for them not tragic they are very happy they are homosexuality of course but when one analyzes the tragic milestone at which they fail they cannot accept the womanly role in relation to the man therefore they relinquish the man the man becomes a and the woman becomes a homosexual or a lesbian where she can then be the man or the woman as she chooses to be with her partner you know in homosexual relationships between women of course and lesbianism and I am not aloof to discuss that also in a lecture like this with the permission of Dr. Fairchild if I may the woman and it is a problem after all which should occasionally be discussed also publicly because in a city like New York there are about 300 to 400 thousand homosexuals and so since it is a problem which cannot be overlooked it has to be taken up by nobody else by the psychiatrist that in the homosexual relationship between women I'm not talking here of men where things are similar but with different mental mechanisms that work but in a homosexuality between women of course the woman then is free to choose as I said before whether she wants to play the male role with her lover with her partner or whether she wants to revert to her own role and be a woman in this homosexual arrangement the third hostile reaction here in women who repudiate their femininity is directed toward the woman's own sex not in the sense as was said before but in the disgust of female functions as a whole female bodily functions as I mentioned them before pregnancy menses and so forth childbirth and female social functions repudiating her role as a homemaker separating herself from all that is considered womanly cooking baking making a home giving the warmth as I said before and accepting the womanly role in life in marital life and in social life in general this severe hostility and complete repudiation complete aversion against being a woman may in the physical field go to those tragic disturbances often irreparable and irreversible clinical psychiatric pictures like psychotic ailments in pregnancy and puerperium after childbirth this is one of course of the serious most severe and very often sometimes fatal complications of this repudiation that a woman as soon as she becomes pregnant as soon as she is in the delivery period or shortly afterwards becomes insane because her nervous system cannot withstand the fact that she became a woman by the pregnancy or that she became a mother by giving birth to a child she is unconsciously so hostile against womanhood and motherhood that she has no other choice but the break with reality the reality gave her a child the reality made her pregnant therefore the reality is bad is evil must be repudiated must be broken with and so she withdraws into a psychosis and becomes insane very serious as you see when we go step by step we start it out with such a simple linguistic expression apparently so simple and apparently so humorous for some of you like the curse and when we go the line down it leads into the insane asylum and into suicide that is the end of the chain at the beginning of the chain just stands well some easy going remark this is a man's world or this is the curse this is that and so forth at the end of the chain stands tragic misery and death to come back from this gloomy picture again to some easier manifestations of the masculinity complex in women there is another very often daily fact which expresses in a rather direct but more or less innocent way a woman's hostility toward her own sex for instance speaking badly about other women gossiping about other women I know that men there are a few in this audience very often wonder very often wonder what makes a woman speak so in such a derogatory way of her woman neighbor of her clothes and of the way she has a hairdo and the way she buys or talks and so forth and in a somewhat oversimplified way it boils down to this very fact the woman does not like other women because she repudiates her own womanhood so she is intolerant of women the fourth factor here at work is one which will please you you have heard now so many disturbing and harsh things I hope not too harsh as you cannot bear with me still for another five or ten minutes because I am still saying later something about men I have something in store even for those few and brave ones here this factor is the hostility of the woman who repudiates her femininity her hostility against men now one should think this is almost illogical if she repudiates womanhood and doesn't want it then she would have a great respect and great admiration for men but it is not so because what she really wants is the mastery over men and in very outspoken clinical cases sometimes the almost conscious desire for revenge against men that they are men and that she is a female in other words the getting even with the man and again this leading in those very very intense and dramatic clinical cases to such tragic manifestations like Bovarism for instance you probably know the novel by Flaubert Madame Bovary where such a woman is described in the most master-like way as only a great novelist can do it with all her revengeful destructive desires coming from the embitterment and the anger and resentment that she is not a man but a female where she destroys everything husband family home friends children and of course in the end herself this desire for revenge which we see also in women who go in for drug addiction or for alcoholism in order to drown out some of these persistent hostile feelings can develop into such outrageous manifestations like a destroyer of everything not only of her own womanhood but the destroyer of manhood and here you see then how it goes into the full circle around that into in these morbid manifestations the propagator and procreator of mankind the figure of the mother and of the woman who is here to uphold to promote to further to ennobled humanity turns into the direct opposite and from a promoter and propagator becomes a destroyer and an enemy of all mankind and of herself as it is in bovarism fortunately a rather rare but occasionally still present manifestations among such severely and morbidly disturbed human beings to a lesser degree this hostility against man comes out very very strikingly but not in this tragic manner as bovarism comes out in marital life and in the choice of a marriage partner for instance a very masculine very domineering very strong minded woman who has given up all this longing for warmth and tenderness and so forth of which I spoke before very often chooses as a marriage partner unconsciously a meek and weak man in order to dominate him of course and then to blame him later for his inefficiency she chose him in the first place because he was weak and meek and then she puts the blame on him he is inefficient he is not a good provider he is not a good lover he is not a good social contactor and so forth but in the she chose him unconsciously she was not conscious because she wanted such a meek and weak and inadequate person it also holds true the other way around most women as you know don't choose such men but in their healthy urge and longing for a healthy masculine husband they choose a he-man they want a he-man and that is their preferred choice as a marital partner and their natural choice however if they carry within them the masculinity complex of which I spoke before then in spite or just because of her choice of a he-man she will ultimately fail in her married life and become unhappy why she chooses a he-man and of course this he-man will behave as such could you perhaps take care of these masculine men or women whatever their masculinity complex is it is rather aggressive when then the marriage takes place between a very masculine minded woman a domineering overly dominating person and a male person who is a he-man as I said he will later behave like a he-man and will make certain demands he will want to dominate he will want to say this is right and we go tonight to this movie and tomorrow to this theater or we don't go and so forth because he is a he-man and has acted always that way and will act also so during marriage and this then is being badly resented by the woman with the masculinity complex because she wants to say where which theater should be seen and which play should not be seen and where the evenings and how the evenings should be spent and again marital difficulties are apt to arise what it all boils down to really is in a summarizing statement quite well given years ago by the psychologist Alfred Adler whose name is known to you who summarized all these manifestations which I spoke here as the masculine protest of the woman not all by far not all but a number of women have this masculine protest either consciously or unconsciously harboring all these resentments and angry feelings in their minds and never recognizing them but attributing them she's angry because of the indigestion it's just the opposite the indigestion comes from the anger she has stomach trouble or headache because of the menstruation it's just the opposite the menstruation who reminds her that she is a woman and not a man gives her the headache and the dizziness or the fatigue and all the other manifestations can in this way at least partly be explained I have to add that a lot here is oversimplified is summarized is cut down to its bones as it were and not detailed enough with sufficient evidence and therefore I would like now to give you a case history or two as an illustration if I have still the time available yes doctor why don't we take about a two minute break right now and we'll take about a two minute break and then if you could give us a few of your case histories we could divide that time with the question all right then allow me just to say still something about the men because otherwise I feel myself not quite safe on this podium you have heard so much about the masculinity complex of women and how they can become resentful I think that if you took a break right now for about a two minute break that it would be better we can resume in about two minutes folks get your questions ready and we're going to go over this lecture again in a very few minutes thank you very much doctor for your talk we're going to we're going to need all the time that we can get in the next half hour because dr. niederland has now promised to talk about men a little bit he has promised to give us some case histories and obviously we'd all like to ask him some questions your poor chairman never had any idea that women had such difficulties or such problems I for one am very glad I'm a man and and in about two to three minutes we will start in again and make this our intermission time thank you I think we can continue now and hear the rest of our somewhat disjointed end of dr. niederland's talk here I'm sorry that we had to break in at the close of his talk but we can continue now dr. niederland and come on back here let me assure you first that it is my impression that the lady who got unwell here did not get unwell because of being here but she has been taken care of by a colleague being outside and has had as it seems a seizure possibly a seizure of epileptoid or similar type which is of course an occurrence happening over a lifetime in people afflicted with these tragic conditions now I had said in a somewhat jocular vein before that I wouldn't like to get the men away here tonight with the feeling that they are the cream of the crop and the peak of creation because to make it briefly all that was said here about the masculinity complex and certain masculine tendencies in certain not all but certain so disposed females takes place in a rather strange but almost strongly parallel way with many males who don't want to be males I already mentioned before when I spoke of the marital choice certain masculinely inclined women unconsciously make choosing a meek passive weak male as a married partner that just as the female sometimes has difficulties to accept her femininity and to live up to it and relinquish all these masculine trends and traits in herself in the same but inverse way the male very often has difficulty in accepting his masculinity you all have known such men who do not want to go out and be active and be good providers and to make a living and to see people and to contact others but who in a sort of passive feminine withdrawal act against their own masculinity after all by nature and also in our society the male is supposed to be the provider to work to help and support the family and to do that with goodwill with happiness to accept it gladly and fully and what happens so often the passive feminine meek and weak type of man doesn't want to do that he doesn't want to be a good provider the wife should make the money and help him support the family and the wife should do this or that and therefore unconsciously he is antagonistic to his own malehood if I may use this word is it correct masculinity I thought I just formed a new word was proud of it Dr. Fairchild takes even away this accomplishment from me he is antagonistic against his malehood he wants to sit in the corner with the slippers around him and with the glasses on and read the paper well if he does that for ten minutes or for an hour even two hours not so bad but if he neglects about these because of his passive feminine meekly tendencies if he neglects his masculine tasks that he has to go out and be active and fight and do things and accomplish things and achieve things and be a man if he doesn't do that then he shows us that he resents unconsciously his masculinity and wants to relinquish it and wants to withdraw into some passive receptive inactive withdrawn with behavior which is not becoming to him which is against his masculinity and which shows the prevalence of feminine passive trends in the male I could give a lecture or two about this one subject and I leave it at that and just finish by giving you instead of the case histories perhaps later in the questions there is still time better some antidotes some ways of dealing with this sometimes quite difficult and at times even a highly disturbing situation when the inner conflict between masculinity and femininity and vice versa becomes very strong and very active in an individual's mind the first of course is and turning back to women again after all this is a course devoted to women and the problems of women the first for women the first task let us say and way to deal with these difficult situations is for women who suffer from a masculinity complex or from some manifestations of this complex to become aware of it to become really aware that if it goes on and on unchecked it means ultimately relinquishing certain aspects important aspects of womanhood and to become aware that even certain psychosomatic difficulties and conditions may be related to this very thing in the way as I expressed in the beginning of my lecture this state of awareness and pay attention to these inner mental processes should be followed second by renouncing the wish for masculinity by understanding that the role of a woman in life well I cannot think of anything higher of anything more sublime and anything on a greater and higher order than the role of a woman especially in this wild and disturbed times of ours where everything seems to shake under our feet and where the most solid foundations of our established laws rules policies and so forth seems to tremble beneath us where is then security safety warmth tenderness and happiness if not in the home in the home made upheld and permeated by a woman's spirit and understanding of love of kindness of living with the home and in the home if possible of course I know in the questions there will come immediately those who will say well what is about the woman who has to go to Macy's every day and make their $30 and $40 and so forth she should send her man to Macy's not to buy there but to work there and insist and if he makes only $30 $40 she should find ways and means and so forth and inspire him and strengthen him and warm him and kiss him and caress him and lead him on until he makes $50 and $60 and is not but all this can only be done if point three which I am going to mention now is fully accepted and again that is the gist of my lecture in order to accept fully and gladly the female role required of her and to fulfill it in that warm and love giving sense I spoke of the woman has to understand that these problems of which I spoke are not only hers but that they permeate the whole family that if she leads a too domineering too active overly dominating and sometimes morbidly acting role in family life then she will not inspire her man to do the things for her but she will crush him he was anyway passive perhaps from the beginning and will make him more passive and so she has to understand that also the male is subject to these things I mentioned in the second part of my lecture just a few minutes ago and that the male the husband very often requires of a woman not only her womanly marital part but if you like it or not although her motherly marital part that the husband the male in general unconsciously looks to a woman more or less as he looked at the first woman who ever existed in his life when he was little and small namely as a child and that when he marries he unconsciously expects you may dislike it you may reject it but he still unconsciously expects to be treated when he is 40 and 50 a powerful male of 250 pounds he wants still to be treated like the little small male he was with 40 or 50 pounds at the age of 4 or 5 or 6 or so therefore is the woman's task so difficult and at the same time so great because in her role as a female she has to be both in order to be happy and to make the others happy she has to be a full fledged woman with all the womanly qualities of warmth kindness love affection and empathy and at the same time she has to be a mother a mother in the true and genuinely motherly maternal sense of the ideal mother and if she can live up to these both too then she has not to be afraid of masculinity and femininity and of all the conflicts because with her womanhood and her motherhood she is the great giver the great victor the great helper and sustainer of life thank you Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to make myself one of the most unpopular people in this place. We only have about 11 minutes left, and by the time we got the questions started and got around to them, we would have about three questions answered, and then you'd be angrier then that I didn't go on with the question period, so that because of the interruption tonight, I'm afraid that we'd better cut our question period, and the next time you come, we will certainly try to have a question period for you. Thank you for being such nice, wonderful people. Thank you.
