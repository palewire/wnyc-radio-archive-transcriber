Ladies and gentlemen, I have the distinct privilege of presenting to you and to the listening audience, His Majesty the Shah of the Red. Mr. Mayor, it is one of the great privileges of my visit to the United States to be welcomed to the metropolis of New York. I thank you most sincerely, Mr. Mayor, for the far too generous words you have just spoken about me. I hope I deserve at least a few of them. I shall strive to deserve more under the inspiration of this hour which will last as long as I live. The certificate of service you have given me, I accept, with deep emotion. It represents, I know, the esteem in which Iran and its people are held here in this great center of population and culture. Iran is not unacquainted with imposing cities, for throughout the centuries great and noble structures have arisen on our soil, some of which survive in splendor to this hour. nor have we been remiss in building for modern life and the modern world. But I must confess, Mr. Mayor, that except for our mountains, nothing in Iran is as tall as the gigantic buildings which, in all their magnificence, give New York its most characteristic aspect. But I well realize that its buildings alone do not represent New York, which is famous throughout the world for its commerce, its superb seaport, and for its cosmopolitan culture. Iran is itself one of the most cosmopolitan countries. Therefore, I have a special appreciation of the many cultural strains and backgrounds that converge here in this great center. Those whose forebears were born in many lands or were themselves born here live and work together here in an atmosphere of toleration, peace, and freedom. It is a great honor and a great pleasure to be greeted in New York, both because of its own special standing among the cities of the world and because it is the seat of the United Nations. I look forward to knowing New York better as I see more of it, which I hope to do. So, on all possible accounts, Mr. Mayor, I most truly thank you and the citizens of New York for this most thrilling welcome. You have just heard the Shaw of Persia, his Imperial Majesty, as he replied to the Mayor of the City of New York. Now the cameramen are demanding some pictures and it's truly amazing.
