Ladies and gentlemen, at the close of a trying year, I want to extend to my colleagues on the Board of Estimate, to the members of the City Council, to all other city employees, and to my fellow citizens of the City of New York my heartfelt wishes for a Happy New Year. I am deeply grateful for the encouragement and support which I received from the people of our city, and for the cooperation and assistance which was extended to me by the press, the radio, civic associations, business groups, civic, business, and spiritual leaders, and my colleagues in the city government. I renew to you the pledge I made when I assumed the office of Mayor of the City of New York that I will administer the affairs of our city for all of the people, regardless of politics, of the people of the city. I will be proud of you, as I said, for the faith you have shown in me. Thank you once again. God bless you all, and a Happy New Year.
