The object of the church, of charity, and of enlightened government has ever been to hold the family together. The protection of children whom adversity has robbed of their homes and of their parents is the high aim of those who would help a fellow man. During 1947, the agencies of Catholic Charities spent more than two and one half million dollars on family care, child care, health, youth activities, and youth counseling. In addition, these agencies supervised the expenditure of 18 million more. This tremendous charitable effort was felt in many homes and institutions. The able and friendly direction of the 1900 Sisters of Religious Orders, who kept fear from the hearts of the helpless, cannot be forgotten. The devotion of these sisters, and of all the other thousands of workers for the Catholic Charities in the Archbishopric of New York, deserves our support. I wholeheartedly endorse this 29th annual appeal, and wish it the success that God would grant to those who have such a selfless devotion to others. Mr. Miley, I have listened closely to the final broadcast of the Adventures in Industry series. I feel I must tell you, in all sincerity, that Life Begins at 50 was a most dramatically effective presentation of the services the city renders to its millions. We sometimes overlook the quietly efficient men and women of the city departments and agencies, who stand ready 24 hours a day to help any one of us when illness or disaster strikes. We may, too, take for granted the necessities and conveniences that reach our homes every day. The people who regulate these services deserve our appreciation. The tax dollar invested in the city of New York gives a greater return than any other investment in the world. I thank you, Mr. Miley, and the Commerce and Industry Association of New York, for telling our citizens in such an effective way how valuable their city is to them.
