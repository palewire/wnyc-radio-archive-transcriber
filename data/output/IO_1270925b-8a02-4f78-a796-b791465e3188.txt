Attention, in 30 seconds we shall broadcast the speech by Doctor Edward Beneš, president of the Czechoslovak Republic. I am glad to be able, at least in this day, to tell you the festive gathering of the One World Award Committee organization which has decided on honoring in 1947 the former Governor and former Director General of ANRA, Mr. Fiorello LaGuardia. I do so gladly for several reasons. The Last War, both by its political and military force as much as by its ultimate outcome, has convinced us that not only the well-being but even the very existence of mankind with its contemporary culture and civilization directly depends on the realization of the idea of a lasting coherent word peace. That before anything else requires goodwill on the path of all people and all nations, but too goodwill must be added for mutual appreciation, the clearing away of mutual distrust and final understanding all around. I see in your organization, which symbolically expresses the concept of a linking together of the world in a moral, common to all, the idea of linking up all those who work against war and strive to ensure that we may live yet to see in our time ever free from war. I cannot leave unexpressed my especial gratification at seeing that in 1947 this mission was placed into the hands of my friend LaGuardia, into the hands of a true fighter for peace, a fighter against all that causes war. To whom, as to anyone striving for a lasting peace among the nations and for a peaceful, neighborly life inside the various countries, I extend my wish that LaGuardia's way may bring the fruits of one world to all peace-loving people who have already overcome war's negations and amorality and who sincerely, openly, and honestly want to join hands in one world.
