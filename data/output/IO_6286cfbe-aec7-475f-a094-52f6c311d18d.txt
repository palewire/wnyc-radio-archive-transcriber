What time is that, Rog? I have past four. I'm getting sleepy, baby. I wonder what's the matter with that old coach. Maybe he's died. He did that in 1575 or something. Shh, I hear something. That's only the dog down in the barn. He must be outside the door now. What happened? I think we got him. He tripped on this chain. See, it's broken. And the pail of water fell right on his head when our door opened. Did you hear him shriek when he saw our scarecrow? Look, he knocked it over. The broom handle is going right through the pumpkin shell. Something tells me that's the last we'll hear, ye old cannibal ghost. Where's Virginia? Your mother's fainted. She's probably in with her. How's Mother Virginia? Virginia's not here, Hiram. Is everything all right? All right? Virginia? Virgie, Virgie. Roger, Roland, help us find your sister. Look in all the rooms. I look downstairs. Virgie, where are you, Virginia? Hiram, what's the matter? Where's Virginia? Be quiet, Mother. She's around someplace. She's not in bed, Daddy. The bed's all messed up. Was that you, Virginia? No, sir. It's me, Mrs. Omney. Has anything happened? Happened? Mrs. Omney, help us find her. Virginia, my little girl. Wake up the servants. Now, Elizabeth, be quiet. We'll find her. She's probably fallen asleep in one of the big chairs downstairs in the library. Is she there, Washington? No, Dad. The library's locked, and she's not in any of the other rooms. This all comes of your crazy fooling in the halls with that... With the countable ghost, Mom? I heard him stalking through here. Washington, catch this key and open the library doors. She may have got in there somehow and fallen asleep. All right, Dad. Since midnight, he's been prowling around. We didn't see him, Mrs. Omney. We've been waiting for him since the clock struck 12. He didn't come out until just a few minutes ago. Oh, Virginia, Virginia. Where's Virginia? My, is she safe after her? Is she there, Washington? No, Dad. Everything's just as we left it in the library, except... Uh, except what? Except the bloodstain. It's back again. Only this time it's much bigger and much bloodier than it's ever been before. Virginia, my baby, my baby. Take her to her room, Mrs. Omney, and wake the other servants. And the gardeners, too. We'll search the grounds. Daylight's coming. I knew it. I knew this was to be the night. This is his revenge for you, don't him the past week. Be quiet, Mrs. Omney. Virginia can't be far. We'll find her if we have to search every corner and tear apart every brick. Oh, is this your hiding place, Mr. G-G-Ghost? My name is Sir Simon DeCanterville. Yes, Sir Simon. What are you doing here? I started to the twins' room to beg them to leave you alone tonight. I feel so sorry for you, Mr. G-G-Sir Simon. But the twins are going back to eat next week. And then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy you. Behave myself? Then I'd have no reason for existing. You know, you've been very wicked. Mrs. Omney told us... Mrs. Omney, bah. The first day we arrived here, that you had killed your wife. That was purely a family matter, and no concern of Mrs. Omney or your family or anyone else. Don't you know it's very wrong to kill anyone? Oh, ethics, bah. My wife was very plain. She never had my ruffs properly starched. She knew nothing about cookery. She couldn't... What's the matter? Are you angry at me for being here? No. Though I'm a bit angry at myself for letting you find me. I was resting. But after all, you're much nicer than the rest of your family. Your father and the boys, I mean. They're rude and disrespectful. Oh! Oh! What's the matter? So it was you who stole my box of paints. And all the different shades of red are used up. That explains that silly blood stain on the library carpet. Well, what was I to do? It's very difficult to get real blood nowadays. Didn't it frighten you? No. Of course it didn't. No, I think it did my mother a little, and it certainly annoyed my father. Mrs. Omney was the only one. Oh, yes. Mrs. Omney's a very satisfactory person. I do hope you'll be nice from now on, Sir Simon. No, no. Please don't go, Miss Virginia. You're a great comfort to one so lonely and so unhappy as I am. But I'm getting sleepy. Sleepy? I have not slept for 300 years. Poor, poor ghost. Have you no place where you can sleep? There is a garden where the grass grows long and deep. Where the nightingales sing all night through. While a cold crystal moon looks down and yew trees spread their giant arms over the sleepers. You mean the garden of death? Yes, death. It must be so beautiful to lie in the soft brown earth with the grasses waving above one's head and listen to silence. To have no yesterday and no tomorrow. Have you ever read the old prophecy on the stained glass library window? Yes. Yes. I learned it by heart the first day we came. When a golden girl can win prayer from out the lips of sin. When the barren almond blossoms bears. And a little child shall give away its tears. Then shall the house be still. And peace come to Canterville. You can be that golden girl, Miss Virginia. And open for me the portals of death's house. For love is always with you. And love is stronger than death is. I don't think I know what you mean. If you will weep with me because I have no tears. And pray for me because I have no faith. You have always been sweet, good, and gentle. Will move the angel of death to have mercy on me. But where would I have to do this, Sir Simon? In darkness filled with fearful shapes. Where wicked voices will whisper in your ear. But they will not harm you. For against the purity of a little child, the powers of hell cannot prevail. Are you afraid? I am not afraid. And I will ask the angel to have mercy on you. Mother! Daddy! Everybody! Where are you? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! My darling, thank God! Where have you been? We were just about to send out searching parties. Hiram! Hiram! She's here in the upper hall! Safe and sound! Oh, Mother! I'm so sorry you were worried. I didn't know it would take so long. Take so long? Virginia! Where have you been, child? Come up, boy! She's here! Tell the servants to go back to bed. Oh, Miss Virginia! All you're really safe! My baby! My baby! Virgie, where on earth have you been? Hooray! Here she is, Roger! Here she is! Hooray! Well, Virginia! Where have you been? I've been with the ghost, Daddy. He is dead. After waiting 300 years, he's gone to sleep in peace. Would you like to see him? Child, what are you talking about? There's a panel in the wall near the window in the tapestry room. He's there in a little cell. Just a skeleton tied to a huge iron ring. Come on, twins! The tapestry room! That would be the remains where they did in all these years of old Simon to Canterville. Yes, Mrs. Omni. He had been very wicked. But he was truly sorry for all that he had done. Before he could really die and go to sleep forever, he needed someone to pray for him. So he asked me to pray for him. And I did. And just before he died, he gave me this box of beautiful jewels. Dad, come quickly! It's here, just as Virginia said. The secret room and the skeleton and everything. The ghost of Sir Simon will walk no more. See, it's light already and quite clear. Oh, I fancy that. What is it, Mrs. Omni? That old withered almond tree in the cot. I do believe it's blossomed. Yes, I can see the flowers quite plainly in the dawn. Can you really, Mrs. Omni? Then you need never fear the Canterville ghost again. For he is now at rest. You have been listening to The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde. Those in the cast were, as Virginia, Eve Schoenholtz.
