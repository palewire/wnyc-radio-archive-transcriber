Ladies and gentlemen, President A. Philip Randolph. Mr. Whalen, Honorable Vincent Impelitari, Acting Mayor of the City of New York, on behalf of the delegates, members, and officers of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, we want to profoundly express our appreciation and gratitude to you both for this delightful, splendid, and unusual reception upon the occasion of the seventh denial convention of our organization and its 25th anniversary in the freest and the greatest city in the world. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Well, while the Department of Sanitation band was playing, Maestro John Celebrate conducting, the Honorable Vincent Impelitere took the occasion to pose for pictures with Mr. A. Philip Randolph and his guests, and all the distinguished guests who have come here today to City Hall commemorating two occasions, the meeting within our city of the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and observing the 25th anniversary of the organization as well, which started with six men and now has a membership of 18,000. Mr. A. Philip Randolph is a graduate of the College of the City of New York, and it is particularly interesting that so much of this has happened right in our own city. Now the Mayor and the Honorable Vincent Impelitere, Mr. Randolph, and the guests today are leaving the Board of Estimate room in City Hall. The Mayor had planned a very beautiful reception outside City Hall for his guest today, but the weatherman was a rather mean person today, and as we said in an announcement here in the chamber, we hope that if the weatherman ever gets on a Pullman train, the Pullman porters will know what to do with him. Well, that's all from City Hall. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System. Municipal Broadcasting System. Municipal Broadcasting System. Municipal Broadcasting System. Yes.
