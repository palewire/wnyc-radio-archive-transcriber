Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is the voice of New York City, WNYC, speaking to you from the Park Terrace Garden Apartments in Astoria, Jackson Heights, Queens, New York. The purpose is the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund Party, given by the Park Terrace Garden Apartments Development. It's a wonderful thing with hundreds of children gathered here this afternoon. The sun is bright, the air is crisp and cold. The wedding for Santa Claus to make its appearance is going to come down a long, long street with a tremendous white beard, red suit, and drive up to the children's stands. And there, the children will see him, greet him, and the party will then get underway. Huh? Hello, everybody. I want to welcome you to the Terrace Park Christmas Party. Can everybody hear me now? Yes. Can everybody hear me now? I want to welcome you all to the Terrace Park Christmas Party. Santa Claus will soon be here with gifts and refreshments for every little boy and girl. And while he's on his way here, I want to tell you a little about this party. As you all know, Terrace Park is a new community of some 258 families. When our tenants' group got the idea for this party, a first party for a first community, we said, let's have an unusual Christmas party. And so we sent a letter to Santa Claus, and we said, Santa Claus, we think it would be a very nice idea at the end of this year to have a Christmas party. But not an ordinary Christmas party, not something in which everybody would just get gifts, but in which we could do something nice for other people at the same time. And we said, you know what, Santa Claus? We've heard of an organization that gives food and medicine and clothing to little boys and girls overseas. And what we think we will do is we will ask everybody in Terrace Park to come to this party. And we will give them gifts from Santa Claus, and we will ask them in turn to give gifts to this organization. And Santa Claus said, he said to me, that's a wonderful idea. That's one of the best ideas for a Christmas party I've ever heard. In fact, I'm going to come down myself. So we said, fine, Santa Claus. We told him how to get to Terrace Park. Now this party is being run. Now if you look down there, you'll see Santa Claus coming now. All right, everybody sit down. He has to go around the development first. This party is being given. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? This party is being given for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. Children, I know that you're going to have to go around the world. You hear that tremendous roar that just went up. Hundreds of children gathered in the street have just seen the procession carrying Santa Claus. And we're waiting for him. We haven't seen him yet. Oh, yes, yes, we do. We see him. We hear the noise. And there is a hush of expectation. Here he is. Look at him. He's a little baby Austin. And he's just waving to the kids. The kids have gone wild again. Do you hear the noise now? Children, will you please wait outside? He'll be here in a few minutes. Now, I know every little boy and girl is very anxious to see Santa Claus and to speak to him. And if you'll just be patient for a few minutes, I'm sure he's going to be here. And he'll probably come here with Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Keep him all around. Now, don't forget. Have your tickets to give to Santa Claus and you will get your gift. And daddies and mommies, we ask that when your child comes to Santa Claus, you remember to give your gift to the UN Children's Fund. Oh. Well, here comes Santa Claus now. Oh, Santa Claus. Oh, Santa Claus. And here he is. And a wonderful sight. The sun is shining brightly and Santa's driving up to the enclosed quadrangle. Mothers are holding little children in their arms because it's the first time they've ever seen Santa Claus in their lives. Baby characters are being wheeled to the curb, too. The father's standing about looking very proudly as the young two look at Santa, hear him, and look forward to greeting Santa themselves. All right, Santa Claus, come on over here. Now you hear the applause and the hand clapping of photographers to take pictures of Santa Claus because should any of the children ever think they hadn't seen him, than there would be photographic proof that they had. And they do see him. All right, Santa Claus, we'll be here in just a few moments, people. Come on, Santa Claus, everybody wants to hear you say hello. All right, Santa Claus. Well, well, Santa Claus, welcome to Terence Park. We're glad you could make it. How do you do, little Dave? And all you fine children? Nice to see you all. Santa Claus, where's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer? Well, Dave, little trouble. Coming down from the North Pole, you ran out of snow. So Rudolph doesn't like this hard ground. So I said to Rudolph, you stay here, Rudolph, and I'll pick me up my little car. So I picked up my little car, and here I am, right at time. Now, children, can I make it? You want to help me up? Come on. Come on. All right, children. If you will all go outside of the benches now, to the entrance, Santa Claus's helpers will let you in one at a time, and then you can come up to Santa Claus and say a few words to him, and he will give you a present. As soon as you're all outside of the gate, then we will begin. Now, don't forget, give your tickets to Santa Claus's helper, Daddy's and Mommy's gift to Santa Claus's helper. All right, children, come on in now and see Santa Claus. Oh! What's your name, little girl? Michael. Michael. You're a boy. You fooled me. You sit up here. How old are you, Mike? Four years.

Not if I've ordered, I'll see what I can do. Okay. Do you need me? That's right. We interview you. We take you to our Mrs. Santa Claus. Can you tell us how this whole project originated, who thought of it, how you got such a wonderful group of people together? Well, the Terrace Park Tenants Group, which is an organization, which belongs to the tenants of this particular development called Terrace Park. We have one representative for each of our 16 units, and these delegates meet. Originally, they met purely on a grievance space with the landlord and tenant, and we had a great relationship, but afterwards we decided to make it into a community activity to carry on with the project. And one of our first affairs is this... The Christmas party. The Christmas party for the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. We felt that it was highly fair to have a party for our kids when there were so many children who were deprived throughout the world, and everyone was in full accord with the court for which the party is being given under the house, by the tenants. Are there any kind of restrictions whatsoever? Yes. Any restrictions to the use to which the funds may be put? The United Nations will allocate the funds to say please do. Then this whole idea is completely non-spectarian and un-univocal. That's right. Yeah, exactly. Is this your son? Yeah, this is my son. Did you say something into the microphone? Go ahead, buddy. We're broadcasting together to NYC. Say something. Tell them about the Christmas party. Why are we always... What's the other one for? Oh, my... You don't have to if you don't want to. Wouldn't you like to tell the children overseas how happy you are to give them a party for them? And how we got all the presents? I'm not feeling right. She doesn't want to say anything about it. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Come on. Thank you for my friends. Something for your friends. All right. See what we can do. Oh! What's your name, little fellow? Harold. Harold? Well, here's a present for you, Harold. You'll be a good boy to your mommy and daddy now. What's your name? Jeffrey. Jeffrey. What would you like, Jeffrey? A fire engine with a cannon. Fire engine with a cannon. That's an order. Come on. Your mommy will take care of you. Oh! Look at the blue-eyed blonde. What's your name? Maureen. Maureen? You're a pretty girl. Here's a big present for you. I'll see you at Christmas. Hello, Maureen. Come on, Maureen. Go over there and get the milk, Maureen. Oh! What's your name? I'm Maureen. Hmm? Maureen.

You people like to say something about the party, why you're here, how you feel with the children here? Would you like to say something, sir? Uh, well, I'd just like to say that, uh, the spirit is fine. The, uh, children are enjoying themselves immensely. And the parents are all happy that they're able to contribute in our small ways to this marvelous organization that is doing so much for so many children like ours that are not as fortunate elsewhere in the world. That's what I'm for. No, I'm not. Oh, no. I'm not. I'm not, huh? What are you doing online? I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. What kind of presents do you want? I don't know. Whatever kind of presents.

Tell her Karen is here too. Of course, then he can get two questions. There we are. He's been over there from the stage to come and give the presents. Oh, you're a lot. I'll do it. Thank you. You've been listening this afternoon, not listening, really eavesdropping, on a Christmas party given out here in Astoria, Queens, on behalf of the United Nations. Its purpose is to distribute clothing and all necessities for children throughout the world. Children perhaps are less fortunate than those in our own country. Children whose lives must be preserved to form a more wonderful life for those to follow. At the present moment, the party is being closed. Santa Claus is bidding all the children goodbye. And the sun, because it is the afternoon, has just settled behind the building directly in front of me. There are a few clouds in the sky, pink tips, and the moon has just come out. And we think it is getting closed for this broadcast. This is WNYC. WNYC FM, Voice of New York. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
