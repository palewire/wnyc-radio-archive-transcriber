But she, in general, Hon. Imperiteri, is also come ambassador of democracy. That democracy is so dear to the United States, but so dear to the Italians, and the Genoveses, especially. For this, Hon. Imperiteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of democracy that lives in the United States, and so every citizen of America, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come to the city's high level representative.

So today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of the democracy and have operated intelligently because it is to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend it in the world. Ebbene, onorevole Imperiteri, onorevole Sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work because the democratic freedom is really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. Forse, sometimes, we Italians don't understand it.

We were in the world We were in the world We were in the world in which our work could be exploited miseries and ravines but the attackment of this force and the faith democratic was so alive that we had taken our work we had to take it out of our work we had to work we have to work we have to work we have to work we have to work we have to work for the people to build our country and to build our country and to build our country and to build our country It is with these sentiments onorevole Imperiteri that I salute you and the city of New York and I say that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of our country in our country we are tenacious and we have examples we have examples we have examples especially in Genova the tenacious of Colombo in searching your own land is an example to all those people deriso non creduto contrastato da ogni avversità dagli uomini e dagli avvenimenti quest'uomo sapeva che questa grande terra esisteva e l'ha cercata disperatamente e andato assondando alle foci dei fiumi e andato cercando negli estuari ovunque cercando quel passaggio che lui voleva trovare per congiungere tutto il mondo sotto la croce cristiana ebbene non importa se lui poi non ha trovato il passaggio non importa se ognuno di noi non trova il passaggio bisogna persistere altri troverà la strada la strada perché tutto il mondo sia libero in pace e nel lavoro passaggio Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts indeed which have a significance in themselves and are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed, we shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen.
