It has been said that in no activity does man approach nearer to God than when he ministers to his fellow man. It is in that spirit that the James Ewing Hospital is being dedicated today. And it is in that spirit of dedication that I am privileged to call upon his eminence Francis Cardinal Spellman to pronounce the invocation. Cardinal Spellman. Life-giving Father in heaven, whose breath is life to man's body, whose spirit is health to man's soul, bless me, this house of healing, this temple of mercy and laboratory of discovery, New York City's new haven for the helpless. Gain to seal the James Ewing Hospital as a home where thy glory dwellest, thou who gloriest in mercy deeds, curing the afflicted and destroying dread diseases.

To come here today and see this cancer hospital actually swinging into action against one of the greatest enemies to public health is gratifying. And this is a good time for me to make a point. A hospital program doesn't develop overnight. Ladies and gentlemen, the first thing I did in 1946 in breaking ground was breaking ground for this hospital. It has taken all of these years to make it into a growing concern. I express now the gratitude of the city to the Memorial Center for making the ground upon which this hospital rests, a gift to the city. I also gratefully acknowledge all the help that all the volunteer hospitals have done for the city and are doing. You have no conception of the difficulty of meeting the demand for medical care for the indigent poor. Even though I tell you that we raised the budget for our city hospitals from $37 million in 1946 to $81 million this year. Believe me when I tell you that that only touches lightly the problem of handling the needs of the volunteer hospitals, a great series of institutions, the ones that his eminence the Cardinal gives, all the other hospitals of a volunteer nature that take our cases. We have raised the contribution that we make to them for city cases, but it falls far, far short of what it costs them to give this service. Ladies and gentlemen, now that this one is open, we're adding a few beds, approximately 300, to hospital care of cancer. Delafield, next week, will be for the same purpose. As Dr. Cogel told you, the program of improving our hospitals has been big. The need has been great. The 570 beds for tuberculosis over in Brooklyn will be ready in October. And as he mentioned, the Burd S. Kohler, 2,000 beds over on the island, which you can see, will be ready by next spring for chronic disease. Then, and only then, will you have arrived at a point in our public hospitals where you can take the chronic disease patients out of your wards, where at the present time they're in inconveniencing and making difficult the administration of our municipal hospital plant for acute medical cases. Then you can begin to see the improvement. The $150 million program for rehabilitation and new construction will follow. It will make a total of $192 million in six years that we have allocated for this work. I wouldn't want the responsibility of stating how $150 million should be spent. Dr. Cogel would not want that responsibility. It's too much. Dr. Berniker, who proceeded, Dr. Cogel wouldn't want it. So what we did was to set up in the law a committee, a board of civilian people. Dr. New George Lindseyえ a continuing hospital board to deal with our municipal hospitals, not only for the construction program, but to elevate and maintain the high standards that this board has been trying to get in their individual capacities over a number of years under the whole medical profession once. This board has been set up. This is the only guarantee that Dr. Kogel and myself can give to the people of this city that the program will be carried out without let off faith in the solely dedicated to the interests of the needy state of the city. With that, my gratitude again to Memorial Center, to Dr. Rohn, to all in, had anything to do with making it possible to add to the facilities of the city for cancer patients with cancer research. May the good God, who made it possible, continue his blessings on it and everyone connected with it, so that when it brings its message of hope to the soul who is without hope, so that it gives a laugh to a human being who has forgotten in his dread how to laugh, that is the work that God surely will bless. Thank you very much. There must be something magnificent in the ideals of this center which can command the services and the means of such outstanding men of our country as Mr. Reginald G. Coombe, Chairman of the Board of Managers of the Memorial Center for Cancer and Illyed Diseases and his associates and the thousands of others whom they, in turn, inspire to serve. And there must be something also in the inherent makeup of these men and women which prompts them to give of themselves so unstintingly. And truly, this magnificence exists in both for the center which is composed of God and to fellow men. it is now my pleasure to ask Mr. Coombe to speak to us. Chairman, Mr. Lillian, all you ladies and gentlemen who have come here today because of your deep interest in the problem of cancer as a public health problem. we are gathered here today to dedicate for use the finest hospital which the ingenuity of man could devise and construct in aid of those who suffer from cancer. It is the property of the city of New York conceived by the city for the benefit of its citizens in consultation with a professional group which has been devoted to the study of cancer as a specialty for the past 66 years. The building stands upon land deeded to the city for the purpose by Memorial Center so that the Ewing Hospital may lie adjacent to and contiguous with the three other units comprising Memorial Center the Sloan-Kettering Institute Memorial Hospital Proper and the Strength Prevention Clinic. Including those at the Ewing, Memorial Center will now have under its care nearly 600 bed cases of cancer and in its clinics many thousands of ambulatory cases coming regularly for treatment. In welcoming the city through the Ewing as our partner in the work to which we at Memorial are dedicated, I should like to tell you briefly of the philosophy, policies, and problems of the center in which the Ewing now takes its place as a vital unit. Our primary task is the study of cancer in man. Hence, the very heart and core of our center lies in the human cases to which we give the most effective therapy possible within the limits of human knowledge. We believe human knowledge must be fluid, not static, and that therefore the techniques of therapy resulting from it should also be fluid, becoming constantly obsolete as increased knowledge introduces improved methods. It is our conviction that a staff of experienced and intelligent men and women observing and treating the greatest number and variety of human cancer patients ever assembled at one point cannot fail to expose some of the present secrets of the disease and in so doing bring about a vast amelioration of it. With this objective, we have assembled two general classifications of staff personnel, the research workers of the laboratories and the clinical personnel charged with care and treatment. It is not wise, however, that these two groups should work in isolation one from the other. They must be in constant contact so that the ideas and philosophies of one may flow into and be interchanged with the ideas and philosophies of the other. Then, and only then, will the research staff become constantly aware of the need for the development of agents of practical use in treatment and in turn, the ideas of the clinician not become vested in the infallibility of techniques of treatment accepted at standard at any given time. An investigative attitude of mind must prevail. We cannot isolate ourselves and our work from others for it must be made available wherever cancer is to be treated. Hence, in addition to the functions of research and of care, it is our obligation also to teach all we know in both of these areas. Thus, the research worker and the clinician must have a little of each of the other in him and both must have the ability to pass his techniques and findings on to others so that they may go out and apply them at points elsewhere beyond our walls. So that the function of teaching may be carried on under the aegis of a top university, there has just been established at the Sloan-Kettering Institute a graduate division of Cornell University Medical College. Greatly strengthening our educational possibilities, this will also bring about a closer collaboration with one of the outstanding general hospitals of the country just across the street, the New York Hospital. In a sense, therefore, two great medical centers, one in general medicine and one specializing in cancer have pooled their knowledge and their efforts for the benefit of patients at the Ewing Hospital. These splendid buildings, equipped with the most modern of apparatus and facilities which you see about you, have come into existence at great cost. Four parties have joined their resources to this end. They are you, the general public, Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Mr. Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., and now the great city of New York. To operate Memorial Center costs over $5 million annually and that does not include the cost of operation of the new Ewing Hospital which will be met by the city. Since neither Memorial Hospital nor the Sloan-Kettering Institute nor the Strang Clinic are heavily endowed, approximately $1,600,000 for resaved and $200,000 for the hospital or a total of $1,800,000 must be raised annually from outside sources. The United States Public Health Service the American Cancer Society the New York City Committee the Damon Runyon Fund the Atomic Energy Committee the National Cancer Institute and other professional donors provide a substantial part of this. The rest must come from you, the general public. Now I mention this because I think you should realize counter to the general opinion that prevails that Memorial is not a wealthy institution. Yet I know that the public believing our way to be for its benefit and of high standards will continue its support. So anyway, we've all got this on a Kollegen under the T of to Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Coombe. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you to Youks cues. Thank you. Mayor Dreyer has a tremendous program and the construction needs of the city would require much more than the sorely pressed capital budget and debt limit could sustain. Mayor Dreyer sponsored the legislation by which you people last year were able to approve a $150 million bond issue outside the city debt limit to be used solely for hospital construction. As Commissioner of the Department of Public Works, which is charged with the design and construction of hospitals, I am proud to report to you people that the entire program is well underway. Our latest report for the first six months of this year shows that four structures already have been completed at a construction cost of $17.5 million and that we have under construction at this time five hospitals to cost an additional $53 million to give us a construction program thus far this year of over $70 million. We also have underway a hospital design program calling for $127 million of hospital construction. Another $10 million will be used over a five-year period for the modernization and rehabilitation of some of our existing hospitals. The mayor and his administration may be well proud of this program. The mayor may be well proud of it as a personal achievement. Since his announcement that he would accept another post in the service of his country, many have been eloquent in their tribute to his record. At this time, I should like to add my own tribute and sincere thanks to the mayor for his cooperation and guidance, which have enabled my department during his administration to break every production record in the history of the department. But no words at my command can match the lasting tribute contained in the building that we dedicate here today. Speeches are soon forgotten. Speeches are soon forgotten. Speeches are soon forgotten. But on what I hope will be frequent visits of the mayor to his hometown, he will see public improvements such as this hospital as a living testimonial and a more eloquent tribute than I could voice to him today. I should like also to point out at this time that none of this hospital program would have been possible without the forward thinking and planning of our most able hospital commissioner, Dr. Colbert, and his predecessor, Dr. Bernicke, and his entire medical staff. Also to the members of the board of Estonia, who may well share the triumph at this moment, as evidence that they have served their city well. Now let me tell you a little about this structure. It is impressive appearance is in complete harmony with the other buildings in this medical group covering the entire square block. Structurally, its hidden strength and quality equals its outer appearance. The entire building is founded on rock and the frame is of structural steel with floor slabs of reinforced concrete. Its exterior walls of brick rise above a granite base and a slate facing to the second floor. The 12-story building with two basements has a gross volume of 2.5 million cubic feet equal to nearly 5,000 single-family houses. And its cost is $5,600,000. The site, as you have been told, was provided by the Memorial Hospital. It occupies the entire west end of the block of the Sloan-Kittering Institute. This 275-bed cancer hospital was designed by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owens & Merrill, under the direction of my department. In direct charge of the work was the director of the Bureau of Buildings, appointed Jay Fowler, assisted by Albert Fowler, architect for hospitals on design, and William Barry, chief of the construction. The plans were started way back in February of 1946 and were completed in 10 months. Excavation was started in January 1947 and today you see the completed structure which embraces the latest developments for the medical and physical well-being of patients. Importantly, it will double the present cancer facilities of the Department of Hospitals. As a practicing engineer and architect, I want to thank all the employees of my department whose skill and toil went into the making of this public improvement. They may well share the pride, the plaudits, and the gratitude that accompany the completion of any large construction job well done. And now, Dr. Kogel, it is my privilege as a commissioner of the Department of Public Works to officially turn over to you this fully completed hospital ready for service. Thank you very much, Commissioner Zimbulin. I'm very happy to accept this magnificent structure. The influence of a great teacher upon his disciples is a chain reaction of goodness. Not alone are they affected by it, but they in turn radiate the knowledge and skills which they have acquired to their own disciples. Dr. L'Esperance was closely associated with Dr. Ewing for many years as an associate and as a student. It is a pleasure for me to call upon her to tell us something about Dr. Ewing, the great teacher, but greater still the kindly human being who is so intensely and personally interested in the welfare of all of his patients. I am a great pleasure to introduce Dr. Ewing for the director of the Cape DePews Strang Cancer Prevention Clinic. Dr. L'Esperance. Members and friends, the completion of this magnificent institution is a fitting tribute to the memory of a great man in the field of cancer.
