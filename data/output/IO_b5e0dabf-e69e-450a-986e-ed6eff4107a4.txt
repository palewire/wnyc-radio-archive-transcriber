Mr. Truman has 8,224,680 votes. Mr. Wallace has 380,200 votes. Mr. Thurman has 500,615. This represents a total vote thus far of 16,643,655.

The situation is altogether too close. However, please note that the New York State totals at the moment are jockeying back and forth. Mr. Dewey is ahead by approximately 8,000 votes at the moment with about two-thirds, little more than two-thirds of the total vote in. Let's pause now a moment for station identification.
