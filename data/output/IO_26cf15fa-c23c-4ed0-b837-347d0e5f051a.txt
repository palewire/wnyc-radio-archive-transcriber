Okay. Will the delegates please take their seats? In accordance with the decision of the conference yesterday, we are convening this morning in plenary session. In further pursuant to the agreement reached yesterday, we shall resume discussion of general observations of delegates on the position of their governments. The delegate from the Netherlands. The chairman, ladies and gentlemen, the Netherlands government has learned with great approval the proposals for the establishment of one health organization, including all states of the world. She has therefore three reasons. First, because the close coherence between the various parts of public health work makes one universal organization indispensable. This means that other world-comprising international organizations in the field of public health will not more be needed in the future. This does not necessarily mean that all which has been built up in the course of the last 50 years could be abolished overnight, leaving their duties to the new organization. In this period, with its enormous lack of labor and goods, one has to be very careful not to replace effectively working institutions by something new. Here, difficult transitional problems present themselves, which must be considered carefully by the conference. However, these problems do not affect the conviction of the Netherlands government that in future only one organization must operate for the protection and promotion of health throughout the world. The second reason why the Netherlands government salutes the proposals with enthusiasm is that she is also convinced that never too much attention can be paid to public health problems. She therefore completely and readily agrees with the preambles to the proposals of the technical committee for the construction of the World Health Organization. She has also read with great satisfaction the statement of the Economic and Social Council that efforts in the field of public health pay dividends, effort and money. It is undoubtedly true that all activities concerning public health must not be undertaken for economic reasons, but for the well-being of humanity. But it is also true that the economic importance of public health is usually greatly underrated. In this respect, we of the Netherlands have considerable experience. Thanks to our measures, before the war, our mortality rate was the lowest of all European countries. So were our infant mortality and the death rate for tuberculosis. Even more than in Europe, we have experienced in the East and West Indian territories. How much a well-organized public health service can achieve. Thanks to our efforts in the East India, we have succeeded in bringing under control the three most important diseases with greatly imperiled public health in this country, namely, smallpox, vulva and plague. In the West India, we have achieved that we need hardly and without serious health streets. There is a third reason why the Netherlands government so readily agrees with the proposals. She acknowledges that for the improvement of public health, which she also considers as a state of physical fitness and of the mental and social well-being and not only the absence of infirmity and disease. The advancement of medical science is of the utmost importance. But she is also conscious of the fact that this is not sufficient. Advancement of medical science has a social significance only when the mass of the population is benefited by its results. Therefore, the Netherlands government greatly welcomes the intention to emphasize the importance of the study of social medical problems. In this respect, she especially has in mind measures of importance to mental hygienic problems. We of the Netherlands and territories overseas have enjoyed before the war a high-level health situation. As a consequence of the war, we have now experienced the meaning of life on a lower level. We know, however, that in many countries this level is far lower than ours. We are gladly prepared to cooperate in the new organization so as to attain in these countries a level of health which equals or perhaps even surpasses our pre-war conditions. The government of the Pays-Bas has been a special thanks to the invitation of this conference. The first one is that the government of the Pays-Bas is profoundly convinced of the need to establish a unique organization in the field of health and hygiene. The efforts dispersed who have been a few years before will be gathered in a single vessel. This, of course, does not mean that it should not be said that it should be disappeared from one day to another. The organizations who, to now, have manifested with such a pleasure in the field of health that we are in the field of health. The population who is located at the same point of health. It's important to not miss out why the efforts may remain. And the progress of progress, the progress of progress of all organizations in one, will certainly be an important factor in the completion of the task that we have before us. The second reason why the government has been to rejoice in this conference is that, to his opinion, we would never be attached to the problem of public hygiene and the problem of assembly. He has salued with joy particular the affirmation of the Social Council, which indiqued that the jobs in the field of public health were those who payed high dividends. This is evident. The question has an aspect of the human being, but we lose too much the importance of the economic of the work in favor of the health of general health. We have, in Holland, had, for a long time, the privilege of jouing in a privileged situation. The general mortality rate, the infant mortality rate, the mortality rate of tuberculosis, was more low in our country than in any other country. We have experienced in our own colonies, in the occident and in the oriental, the benefits of an organization of good health service. In particular, in the Ireland, we have managed to impose, we have managed to dominate the three diseases the most important in these countries, the cholera, the pest and the petit verran. We have, in this point of view, won't be able to achieve success considerably. We have, in this point of view, won't be able to achieve success considerably. And we have understood what could mean in this case an intervention of a good organization of health health. Finally, we have, in the last few years, now, what could mean for a country to live in a health condition sanitaire diminuée. We, I have said, we were used to have a very high level. The war has made us touch the doigt, what could mean for a country the disappearance of its bienfaits. But we are completely aware that it is a country where the level is even lower than the nôtre, and the need to reach an international agreement to combat this situation lamentable, is appeared with more clarity. It is the reason why the government of the Pays-Bas has the intention of collaborating with all its power to achieve the goal of the goal of the competition. the delegate from Liberia. Mr. President, and colleagues, Liberia is one of today's important geoconies. one of today's important geographical crossroads. Being one of the closest points on the African coast with reference to the Western Hemisphere, air traffic by means of Pan American Airlines between Liberia, the Western Hemisphere, and Europe, ties the health of my country intimately to the health of three continents, and indirectly to the entire world, which becomes smaller every day with advancement in air technology. A modern airport at Roberts Field in Liberia now provides adequate facilities for uneven and rapidly increasing international air traffic. I am certain that delegates of this conference recall the invasion of certain sections of South America by North America by North East Gambia less than a generation ago. The repetition of this cause is avoidable, and prevention of such a repetition is obligatory. May I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that Liberia is making every effort to prevent the transportation of exotic diseases and vectors from our shores to yours by air. May I point out further that the construction of a modern seaport at Monrovia increases the hazards of international disease contact. It is expected that this port will be completed by 1948, and His Excellency the President of Liberia is directing efforts now towards the provision of adequate protection to international health as relates to the port of Monrovia. But the possibility of transmission of diseases and vectors, mainly malaria and Anapolis Gambia from Liberia to other parts of the world, is not the complete story. Liberia must also protect herself and be protected by you from transmission of diseases and vectors exotic to Liberia from your shores to ours. It is towards these two conjunct ends that the present United Nations Organization Health Conference fulfills a great need and control between our country and yours. You will be interested, I am sure, in knowing what Liberia is doing to improve the health of our population and to protect the rest of the world from the exotic disease and vectors existing in Liberia. My government now employs a number of Haitian and French physicians in its health service. They are being assigned to stations in all of Liberia's provinces, disseminating medical and health information, making studies of diseases and vectors, and operating treatment clinics for control of disease indigenous to Liberia. Liberia has recently purchased and is now setting up an additional 200-bed hospital in Monrovia, and is building a new hospital and clinic at Cheyenne in the Western Province, in cooperation with the United States Public Health Service Mission, also in Sino and Basel counties. We have invited the French and British medical authorities to confer with our public health representatives on control of prepancy mediasis and its vector, the glycina fly. Just before I left Liberia, I had the pleasure of conferring with Medical General Moraes, the Parency Mediasis Specialist from the French Office of Colonial Medicine on Coordination of Sleeping Sickness Control between Liberia and Contiguous French Territory. Through this conference, it has been arranged for Liberia medical students to be trained in prepancy mediasis control in French Guinea and French Avro code. It is proposed and expected that similar conferences will be held between British and Liberia medical representatives in the near future. As a matter of fact, negotiations were initiated with Dr. Ray of the British Colonial Office last year towards the end of training Liberian technicians in Lagos and other British colonial schools. Last but not least, at the request of President Tubman, a United States Public Health Service Mission was dispatched to Liberia by the late President Roosevelt in November 1944. This mission under the able guidance of my advisor, Dr. John B. West, has done remarkably well towards eliminating the Anopheles, Mosquitoes and Malaria, as well as flies and diarrheal diseases from Monrovia. By continuation and expansion of control methods initiated by the United States Army at Roberts Field, this mission in cooperation with our own public health service is keeping our major airport free from exotic disease and insects, thus protecting the outside world. We cannot overemphasize our appreciation to the government of the United States and of course to Dr. Thomas Buran, who was in charge at the time, and to Dr. West for this contribution. Since Liberia is the only independent nation on Africa's west coast, and since our development is largely dependent on health, my country would welcome and desire having one of the regional bureaus established at Monrovia. May I add further, that in Section 3, dealing with the functions of this health organization, in the preamble discussed yesterday, no reference to tropical diseases was made. You undoubtedly recall the traffic through the tropics during the last war. May I suggest that one paragraph be added to Section 3, dealing with tropical diseases and, if possible, establish an international institute on tropical medicine. Mr. President and my colleagues, the Liberia is one of the important points of crossings of the mountains of the geological area, because it is one of the points that is close to the African coast to reach the west coast. The traffic aérien, thanks to the Pan-American lines between the Liberia, the West and Europe, lies the health of my country, intimately, to the health of three countries and indirectly to the whole world, which is the day in the day, as soon as the progress in the air becomes more real and more. A modern airport, Robertsfield, Liberia, has now a sufficient facility for a traffic aérien which is growing up every day and more rapidly. I am certain that the delegates at this conference will remember the invasion of some regions of the South by the NFL Gambier there is less than a generation. A repetition of this could certainly not have a place and the prevention of a such repetition is obligatory. I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Liberia does all the necessary efforts to prevent the communication of exotis and vectors of our rivages by the way of the air. Could I also attract attention to the fact that the construction of a modern airport to Monrovia increase the hazards of contact in terms of international maladies? We are hoping to achieve this airport in 1948. And His Excellency, Mr. William Tubman, President of the Republic of Liberia, does all the necessary efforts to ensure a proper protection in terms of international health in terms of the port of Monrovia. But the possibility of transmission of maladies and vectors, and especially the paludism and the Anopheles Gambier from Liberia to other parts of the world, is not an issue. The Liberia must also protect and protect you from the transmission of maladies and vectors exotis from Liberia to your river, and the diseases exotis, from the Liberia to your river, to your river. And it is towards these two goals that the Organization of Health Health will be able to fill a great role and will also be a great need in terms of the possibilities of control between your countries and the country. You would be interested, I am certain, to know what the Liberia does now to improve the health of its population and to protect the rest of the world of maladies exotiques and vectors that exist in Liberia. My government employs in fact, at the moment, a certain number of doctors, Haitians and French in its health services. They are assigned to all the provinces of Liberia, and in its post, they are sharing medical and sanitary information, they are doing studies of the disease and vectors, and they also direct the treatment clinics to control the diseases in Liberia. The Liberia has recently bought and is in place a new hospital of 200 lits in Monrovia. And it is built a new hospital and clinic in Tiananmen, in the province of the East, in cooperation with the service of public health of the United States, who has envoyed a mission, and it is also in Simole and Bassacumbian. We invited the medical medical authorities and British to confer with the representative of our administration of the public health care, on the control of trypanosomiasis and his vectors, the moushglosina. Just before leaving the Liberia, I had the pleasure of conferring with the general general Murase, specialist in trypanosomiasis of the Office of the Colonial medicine on the coordination of the control of the sleep between the Liberia and the French territories. Grâce to this conference, we have to do the necessary to do the students of Liberia to study in the control of trypanosomiasis in the French and the French Guineas and in the Côte d'Ivoire. We also wanted to, and we would like, that the conference semblable will be held between the representatives in the health care of the Great Britain and the Liberia and this in the near future. In fact, the negotiations have been started with the Dr. Ray of the British colonial colonial the year ago, to allow the technicians of Liberia to study in the schools of Lagos and other colonial colonial schools. Finally, and I cite this, in the last resort, but it is not that I attach an importance moindre, a request of the President Tubman, a mission of the public health care of the United States was envoyée in Liberia by the President Roosevelt in November 1944. This mission, under the remarkable direction of my conseiller, Dr. John B. West, has made remarkable efforts to eliminate the animal and the paludism as well as the mouches and the disease of the diarrhea of Montreviens. In continuing, and in extending the methods of control which have been presented by the United States at Robertsfield, this mission, in cooperation with our own health care, has made all its possible to avoid to avoid that the exotic diseases and insects come to contaminate our major airport and, in this case, to protect the whole world. We cannot say enough our recognition to the United States, Dr. Thomas Parren and Dr. West for the contribution they have thus brought to this point. this cousin of Europe is calling the wirs of World Vere As for it to the ajudar solheitsist by the world, the reputation of all military needs on the territory of the region and that this one is established at Montreviat. I would also add, Mr. President, that Section 3, which is concerned about the functions of the International Health Organization and which we discussed in the preambule during our session, has not talked about tropical diseases. I believe that you realize and that you certainly recall that, by the increase of traffic in the tropics during the last war, this point has been raised. I would suggest that a paragraph is added to Section 3, which would be related to tropical diseases and, if possible, that we create an international institute of tropical medicine. The delegate from Mexico. The word is to Mr. Delegate of Mexico. Mondragón, Mexico. Mr. President, Mr. Delegates, Mexico comes to this Health Organization Conference of the United Nations, with the most broad and sincere desire to collaborate with the task of forging a technical instrument of work that serves to achieve the ideal health for all men and all peoples. In the history of international organizations of health, the name of Mexico, the name of Mexico cooperating with the other nations, the general representatives for equality how to treat the same James of its specialists has facilitated the exchange with other countries for professional education and has opened its research and teaching and teachers and foreign teachers. Mexico has accepted with enthusiasm for its past and present, taking part of this International Health and Health and support resueltamente the project of that form a World Health Organization and that adopt the principles and principles of its constitution, the points of view contained in the document elaborated by the Committee of the Preparatory Committee that was in Paris from 18 to 15 to 15 of this year. Mexico estima conveniente, necesaria y urgente en las actuales circunstancias la creación de la nueva Organización Mundial de Higiene motivo de esta conferencia. Las tareas que este organismo tendrá a su cargo son hoy más grandes y más importantes que nunca, pero también se cuenta ahora con mayor experiencia, mejores técnicas y más amplios recursos científicos, por lo que se impone más cooperación y coordinación de los diferentes pueblos del mundo para la resolución de los complejos problemas sanitarios existentes. México formó parte de la Comisión Técnica Preparatoria para la Constitución de la Organización Mundial de Higiene y por lo tanto, en sus proposiciones están plasmados sus pensamientos e ideas. Y es por ello que ahora venimos a ratificar el contenido del informe del Comité Técnico Preparatorio, como la expresión de la actitud general de nuestro gobierno ante ese documento. El señorío Técnico Preparatorio es Money Barrinho Mexico is present in this health conference of the United Nations with the most complete purpose and the most sincere desire to collaborate to the task of making a technical instrument of work to realize the idea of health for all men and for all the people. In the history of the international health organizations, Mexico's name is found from its very beginning cooperating with the other nations, sometimes in order to use by common agreement the resources of epidemiology for the prevention and control of communicable diseases. Other times, it has worked for the establishment and the use of international biological standards or to avoid epidemics through health services, or has taken care of care to prepare its specialized personnel and has given facilities for interchange with other countries towards the professional education in public health, and it has opened its research and teaching institutions to foreign teachers and students. Mexico accepts with enthusiasm for its past and its present to take part in this international health conference and supports with all decision the plan to form a World Health Organization and to adopt at its basis and procedures for its establishment the report of the Technical Preparatory Committee at its Paris meeting from March 18th to April 5th this year. Mexico considers as convenient, necessary and urgent in the present condition the creation of a new World Health Organization proposed at this conference. The tasks which this organization shall have are today greater and more than the important than ever, but today we also have more experience, better knowledge and more than ever. and better scientific resources and that's why we need greater cooperation and coordination. of the different nations of the world for the solution of the different nations of the world for the solution of the complex sanitary and problems which now exist. Mexico took love to support its took part in the Technical Preparatory Committee for the Constitution of the World Health Organization. And its purposes are with its thoughts and ideas in that report. And that's why today we come to ratify the contents of that report as the general expression of our government in this conference. The delegate from India, Dr. Moni. Mr. President, Mesdames et Messieurs, C'est avec un enthousiasme évident que le Mexique assiste aujourd'hui à cette conférence des Nations Unies sur les problèmes de santé qui nous intéressent plus au plus haut degré. Et je peux vous assurer du désir très sincère de la délégation mexicaine d'assurer sa collaboration la plus complète à cette heure. Je crois que le travail que nous sommes ici pour réaliser est de la plus haute importance. Et la délégation du Mexique se rend très nettement compte de l'intérêt qu'il y a pour les hommes à arriver à dominer toute la dissémination des microbes dans le monde. Dès le début d'une installation d'une organisation de la santé publique, le Mexique s'est trouvé au premier rang de ceux qui coopéraient et qui désiraient coopérer au plus haut degré avec les autres nations. C'est ainsi qu'aujourd'hui encore, le Mexique croit qu'il faut user de tous les moyens possibles pour arriver à préserver le monde des fléaux qui l'ont déjà accablé et qu'il faut arriver à contrôler absolument tous les microbes dont nous pouvons avoir à souffrir. C'est pourquoi nous sommes persuadés de l'utilité, de l'importance extrême qu'il y a à installer, à instaurer le plus tôt possible une organisation générale de la santé qui lutterait contre ces épidémies que nous craignons tant. Je crois aussi qu'il y a intérêt à préparer un personnel spécial, technique et expérimenté d'après les bases les plus sélectionnées et le Mexique, dans ce but-là, est en train de former actuellement des élèves et des étudiants qui auront l'expérience et les capacités nécessaires d'ici peu de temps. Ainsi, le Mexique accepte avec enthousiasme de prendre part à tous les travaux de cette organisation et s'acquittera certainement le mieux qu'elle pourra de tous les problèmes dont on la chargera. Nous voudrions que cette organisation de la santé mondiale, qui ne peut manquer d'être créée rapidement, adopte les bases de travail et la procédure établie dans le rapport élaboré par le Comité préparatoire de la santé publique dans sa première session au cours de ces derniers mois. Le Mexique considère en effet qu'il est à la fois nécessaire, urgent et bien plus qu'utile encore de créer une organisation qui arrivera à coordonner tous les différents problèmes de la santé entre les différents pays mondiaux. Aujourd'hui, plus que jamais, nous devons mettre en œuvre tout ce que notre expérience et tout ce que la science nous a procuré pour pouvoir lutter contre la situation qui est née du fait de nos ressources augmenter continuellement sur le plan scientifique. Ainsi donc, cette coopération devient essentielle plus que jamais et il me semble que la solution aux problèmes complexes qui existent actuellement et que nous sommes chargés de résoudre doit être envisagée sur le strict plan humanitaire et salutaire. C'est dans les vues de rendement que nous devons axer tout notre travail et nous devons le mener à bien. Le Mexique a pris part aux travaux profonds et difficiles du Comité préparatoire des questions sur la santé publique. Il a connu toutes les difficultés de la question et en même temps, il était entièrement d'accord avec les vues et les points qui ont été soulignés dans le rapport définitif du Comité préparatoire. Ces idées-là, le Mexique, bien sûr, est toujours d'accord pour vouloir les instituer et il espère qu'elles seront la base des travaux de l'Organisation internationale de la santé publique. Ainsi donc, nous souhaitons qu'aujourd'hui, cette assemblée ratifie le contenu de ce rapport et avant de terminer, nous voudrions souligner encore le cœur avec lequel nous allons participer à tous les travaux dont nous serons chargés au cœur de cette Organisation mondiale de la santé publique. Delegate from India, Dr. Laksman. La parole est à Monsieur le Delegé de Saad. Monsieur le Delegé de Saad. Monsieur le Delegé de Saad. Monsieur le Delegé, la Sous-Tage de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé publique that a World Health Organization should be established. The disappearance of the Health Section of the League of Nations, in whose activities India actively participated, has made necessary the establishment of a new international organization to take its place. The Health Organization of the League of Nations and in its own sphere the Office International showed the possibilities of fruitful collaboration between the nations in the field of medicine and health. If, in the words of the President Truman's message to the Social and Economic Council, peace is to be made a reality for the common people, it is more than ever necessary that there should be the closest collaboration and cooperation between the nations, not only for prevention of spread of disease, but for the improvement of the general standard of health. The Government of India agree that the opportunity should be taken to bring all international health relations within the scope of a single organization. They also agree that this organization should take the form of a specialized agency in association with the United Nations. They regard the machinery proposed by the preparatory committee as being generally workable and appropriate for the purpose in view. The Government of India recognize that regional associations of countries with problems of a like nature may be necessary for purposes of mutual consultation or for the provision of epidemiological service. They consider it important, however, that any such regional organizations should form an integral part of the general framework of the World Organization, and that their functions and responsibilities should be supplementary to, and not parallel to those of the central organization. The objectives in view can best be served by a single unified world organization, and anything in the nature of a federation of autonomous regional organizations is to be deprecated. It is recognized that in the case of existing organizations, transitional arrangements of a suitable nature may be necessary, but whether the question is one of transformation of existing agencies, or the creation of new regional agencies, or the creation of new regional agencies, technical considerations, and the need for promoting collaboration on a world basis through a single, vigorous, and progressive world organization should be the determining factors. The Government of India endorsed the view expressed in the committee's recommendation that the headquarters of the organization should be located in a place where communication and other facilities are adequate. They would urge, however, the importance of contact with other specialized agencies concerned with conditions of living and environment which affect the maintenance, the attainment, and maintenance of health. It is clearly desirable that the World Health Organization should have close contact with such agencies as Food and Agricultural Organization and the International Labor Office. The Government of India hopes that it will be possible for them to accept the Constitution which emerges from the discussions of the Conference, but it is necessary to consult the Indian Legislature before doing so, and they have therefore empowered the delegation to sign the final act of the Conference subject to ratification. The President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President, the President of India is in agreement with the proposal to establish a World Health Organization, post- Houseweek change of theeri recovered, the seitdemment of the saatto goin toいただ servicio of part-for-de-bentering and serve the Capeого Alm��릴게요 to initiate the Non-International樹 x4 That the President, the International Luttết academy as well as the Central Particularly has demonstrated the possibility of a fruitful collaboration in the medicine and health. If, according to the words of the message of Mr. President Truman, addressed to the economic and social council, the peace becomes a reality for the people, it is never necessary. There is a strong collaboration between nations, not only to prevent the spread of disease, but also to improve the overall level of the health. The government of the Indies affirms that the opportunity must be seized to make, in the midst of one single organization, all the international relations in the field of health. He is also agree with the fact that this organization should take the form of an organization specialised in association with the United Nations. He considers that the mechanism proposed by the Committee of the Committee and, in general, practical and appropriate to the goal we have in view. The government of the Indies recognize that the regional nations of countries whose problems are similar to be necessary for the need to be able to make a mutual consultation or to make an agreement of the service of the epidemiology. The government of the country is important, however, that the regional organizations form a part integral part of the general organization of the world's role that their functions and responsibilities must be complemented and not parallel to those of the central organization. It's so important to use. The objective could be reachedатель coin fifteen-house or even other branches. 0 Second pattern of the region, нез transactionnel, d'une nature appropriée pourrait être nécessaire, mais qu'il s'agisse de la transformation des organismes existants ou alors de la création de nouveaux organismes régionaux, les considérations techniques et le besoin de favoriser la collaboration sur une base mondiale par une seule, vigoureuse et pratique organisationnelle, devrait constituer le facteur déterminant. Le gouvernement des Indes endosse l'opinion exprimée par la recommandation du comité que le siège de l'organisation doit se situer en un endroit où les communications et les autres services seraient facilement obtenus. Vous insisterez cependant sur l'importance que comporte le contact avec les autres organismes spécialisés qui s'occupent des conditions de vie et du climat moral qui a son importance dans le maintien du niveau de la santé. Il est évidemment désirable que l'Organisation mondiale de la santé ait des contacts les plus étroits avec des organismes tels que la FAO ou le BIT. Le gouvernement des Indes espère qu'il leur sera possible d'accepter une constitution qui sortira des discussions de la conférence. Mais il est nécessaire de consulter tout d'abord la législature des Indes avant d'en agir ainsi. Et ils ont par conséquent autorisé, le gouvernement a par conséquent autorisé sa délégation de signer l'acte final de la conférence sous réserve de ratification ultérieure. La parole est à monsieur le délégué de l'Argentine. Monsieur le Président, je vous demande la provisión du problème espagnol. Allá. Señores delegados, la República Argentina, al enviar a esta magna asamblea su delegación, continúa con una tradición que en materia sanitaria se inició al principio de este siglo al fundarse la Oficina Sanitaria Panamericana. Unida íntimamente a ese organismo de sanidad, ha dado en todo tiempo su aporte a las conclusiones que tanto las reuniones de directores de sanidad como las conferencias sanitarias que se celebran cada cuatro años dictaban para la defensa sanitaria del continente americano. Esa política de colaboración interamericana, de larga tradición ya entre nosotros, se afirma en estos momentos y cada vez más con un gobierno que ha surgido en nuestro país por voluntad casi tan unánime de su pueblo y que tiene dentro de sus propósitos una ideología bien definida. No está de más, señores, decir en estos momentos cuál es el pensamiento que guía la delegación argentina en la manera en que trabajará y aportará su poca experiencia y sus muchos deseos al trabajo de la conferencia. El gobierno argentino parte del respeto a la persona humana. El gobierno argentino parte del respeto a la persona humana. Cree que esa persona tiene en sí mismo su propio destino y que la colectividad, la sociedad, le debe dar lo que esa persona como un derecho puede reclamar. El desarrollar los dones recibidos al nacer es un derecho de todo nacido y en tal sentido la defensa de la salud más que la lucha contra la enfermedad es el propósito esencial de la nueva Secretaría de Salud Pública que con jerarquía de ministerio acaba de ser creada. Esa persona humana tiene derecho a la salud. No porque creamos nosotros que la salud es un fin en sí. Creemos que la salud es un medio para vivir plenamente. Y es asegurando la salud que daremos nosotros al pueblo de la República Argentina hoy o más tarde, no importa, pero algún día seguramente, ese bienestar que la carta magna de nuestro país, esa constitución del año 53, establece que debe ser promovida por el gobierno de la Nación. Si es que buscamos el bienestar de nuestro pueblo, la salud es uno de los fines que debe llevar a cabo la organización de ese pueblo, hecha a través de su gobierno, que tiene la delegación de ese pueblo para regir sus destinos. Y es entonces no solamente en las cosas que están íntimamente digradas a las causas directamente generadoras de las enfermedades las que deben ser cuidadas, sino que el propósito de la Secretaría de Salud Pública y por ende del gobierno argentino, es asegurar a cada uno de los habitantes, paulatinamente, los elementos necesarios para que él mismo pueda cumplir su propio destino, el destino de la persona humana. Es así que la política del trabajo, la de los salarios, y en una palabra, resumiéndola en una sola, el programa de justicia social que este gobierno ha iniciado, es parte e integrante del programa de salud pública que piensa desarrollar. He dicho al comenzar, de que la República Argentina sigue una vasta tradición en materia de sanidad internacional, íntimamente ligada a la oficina sanitaria panamericana, y también con una colaboración que ha prestado y que le ha sido dada por otras dos organizaciones internacionales, hoy desaparecidas, la Organización de Higiene de la Sociedad de las Naciones, el Oficio Internacional de Higiene de París. Pero de cualquier manera que sea, es a la oficina sanitaria panamericana que nos sentimos más vinculados, y es a ella que nosotros trataremos de estar siempre unidos para el progreso de todas las repúblicas que forman el continente americano, y que tienen problemas que ni si no son similares, por lo menos son análogos, y que tienen un factor de orden psicológico que hay que cuidar y que les es propio. En cambio, dentro de los límites del territorio del país, el gobierno que se inicia, y que ha tenido a bien de enviarnos a esta Asamblea como los delegados, afirma su propósito inquebrantable, de cuidar él directamente con sus propios medios, y dando todos los medios que sean necesarios, la salud de su pueblo, creando ese bienestar, que es simplemente una consecuencia de una idea filosófica, de una ideología, diría cristiana, que es la de dar a cada uno de los nacidos las posibilidades de desarrollar los dones recibidos del Creador. Un país que está con los brazos abiertos, como lo dice su propia constitución, para recibir toda persona de buena voluntad que quiera habitar el suelo argentino, también a esos que de otras patrias vengan a buscar lo que en ellas no han encontrado, la República Argentina les dará las posibilidades de desarrollar los dones que hayan recibido al nacer en su propia patria, y hará todo lo posible para convertirlos en ciudadanos de esta misma patria nueva que ellos han adoptado. Y nada más, señor. Aplausos. CBAR CAUFERENTO CONSEGENERÉN UFREENE ALDUVONE No hay traductor The secretary says that they regret very much that the translator of Spanish to English and French who was here is not available and regrets that we cannot give the translation at this time. There is, however, I assume a recording of the address by the delegate from the Argentine. For later translation. The delegate from Poland, Dr. Popchak. La parole est à monsieur le délégué de la Pologne. Le président a indiqué que le secrétariat lui a dit qu'il n'y avait aucun traducteur qui pouvait donner une traduction de l'espagnol en anglais ou en français, que néanmoins le discours prononcé par monsieur le délégué de l'Argentine avait été enregistré sur disque et que par conséquent une traduction en serait diffusée ultérieurement. The delegate from Poland, Dr. Popchak, has returned. The members of the press have said that they cannot understand the speakers very clearly unless they speak into the microphone to the right. Excuse me, to the left of the speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, Ladies and gentlemen, the final report of the Technical Preparatory Committee did never reach Poland officially. Therefore, it could not have been taken into consideration. We discussed the whole problem on the basis of the preliminary report I had with me, being myself a member of that committee. We are certainly of the opinion that there is a very great need of an international health organization. This is not merely a theoretical statement and expression of good wishes. This is a great need proved by the past and by the present. Allow me to remind you of the period we had to live in after the first great war. The wave of epidemics was a menace to the whole of Europe. Thanks to the real help given to our health administration, it was possible to stop the spread of most important infectious diseases, especially of typhus fever, typhoid fever and even of cholera. I would like to mention that after that war, we had in Warsaw the international conference, which convened under the office of the health section of the League of Nations. At this conference, met for the first time at the same table, the conquerors and the conquered equally eager to combat pestilence as a great danger to the whole humanity. We cannot forget also the 20 years' activity of the health section of the League of Nations. If we take the present time into consideration, we must state that without ANRA and the international Red Cross world, the state of health, at least in Europe, conditions existing in other parts of the world are unknown to me, would be very much worse. I would like not only to mention it, but to stress upon and to express our deep appreciation and gratitude. The second point I would like to make is whether we should have one health organization or more. I think that both the simple logic and the real state of affairs during the past 20 years, between two wars, prove the necessity of having one single organization. As a matter of fact, this point ought not even be discussed if we have not in the past several coexisting organizations. It had its historical grounds, but we have no reason to keep it any longer. That many of the existing international health organizations did really good work and could do still better in the future is a fact. But we can certainly and should use the largest extent of their experience of these organizations, even their staff. This leads us to the next important point I have in mind to the regional offices of this only one health organization. We are greatly in favor of their existence and development. I do not see any possibility for one health organization to do a real effective work throughout the world without any decentralization. There is no possibility for one, even most powerful and best organized body, to take into account all local needs, particularities and possibilities. The only way out is to settle regional offices whose existence and activities should be based on climatic, cultural and social peculiarities of different regions. I do not need to stress upon that central health organizations should not be super-governmental institutions. I imagine it will have much to do with coordinating the work of different countries by stimulating it and by assisting the governments if asked for. One point more, we must not limit ourselves to the hygiene problems. All governments are recognizing now that they cannot exclude from their field of interest curative medicine. We all know that prevention is very important, that it is cheaper and more reasonable to attack the disease before it is seen or felt, but no matter how we protect against the disease, we are very far from eradication of the evidence. The curative medicine is as important as preventive and should be included into all our programs. In relation to our yesterday discussion, I should like to mention that we are greatly in favor of including social insurance and health insurance into our program. It seems to us only reasonable that the population problems should be included also in the program of World Health Organization. The special importance of population problems and of vital statistics to the work of the International Health Organization should be clearly marked in its scope. Although the demographic problems are to be object of study of a special commission of the Economic and Social Council, it is useful to mark at this stage the very special interest to the new health organization of this problem. Going this way, we will approach the idea stated in the preamble of the proposals of the Technical Preparatory Committee on Health, that the right to health is one of the fundamental rights to which every human being is entitled, without distinction of race, religion, political belief, economic or social condition. The question is, Mr. President, is the problem that we have under the eyes of the International Health Organization is the problem of the International Health Organization. I would like to tell you that the problem we have under the eyes of the problem of the International Health Organization. We have under the eyes of the International Health Organization. We have under the eyes of the International Health Organization. And I would like to remind you the period that immediately followed the World War. In fact, after the period that followed the First World War, the maladies long-dueuses have occurred to the surface of the world. And I would like to remind you immediately that it is only thanks to the Health Administration that it has been possible to prevent the epidemics from across the world. And in this way, we have in particular been enabled the typhoid, the typhus and the cholera. I would like to remind you, Mr. President, to the International Health Organization, to the International Health Organization, which was meeting immediately after the war, under the auspices of the Health Organization Society. It is for the first time that, at the time of this meeting, the people of the countries of the world who had been able to meet, and to fight the disease in the world. I would like to mention here, the precious services that have been given by the Health Organization of the Society of Nations. And now, Mr. President, I would like to remind you of the wonderful work that has been made by the UNRWA organization, and by the International Health Organization. Thanks to them, in fact, the health services in Europe and the health health care of this part of the world, I will not speak of the other parts of the world where I do not know the health care, have been able to progress or at least not have been able to go through the same way. I would like to take part of my passage here, to highlight all the appreciation of the services made by these organizations and express my recognition. I would also like to present a second point of view. It is the point of view of the following. Do we have one only organization of the world's health care or do we have several? Well, I believe, Mr. President, that it is necessary to have one only organization of the world's health care. In fact, we would not have to worry about this point if in the past there were not many organizations of the health care. But these organizations of the health care multiple have existed for reasons historiques and I believe that there is no need to continue their existence at the current time. The point of view is the existence of regional bureaus of this organization unique. And I am immediately to indicate that I am in favor of the creation of these bureaus region. In fact, Mr. President, it seems impossible to have this organization unique of the world's health care and the world's health care, that we have to examine the conditions that exist in the world. From there, I see a need to be very net of decentralization of this organization. In fact, as I said earlier, this organization unique can be taken care of all regions, all diseases, all possibilities. Therefore, we need to create bureaus regionaux. And these bureaus regionaux should be created in pre-prepared as a basis the social and physiologic particularities climatological, and physiologic of the libertarian. In fact, this organization should not be a organization which would be above all the governments of the world. In fact, this organization should only be a coordination, an improvement, an improvement, and in some cases, to help the governments nationals if a such desire is expressed by these governments. I would also like to indicate the importance of hygiene. This is well known. But, even if we observe a total hygiene, even if we apply to prevent all the diseases, it is not important to prevent all the diseases. It is certainly not important to say that, by the way of preventing the diseases, we achieve a less expensive hygiene. But, even if we achieve a preventable disease, it is impossible to completely suppress them. So, it is not important to forget the importance of the medicine curative. It is also a very important point. In fact, I am in favor of a point that has been presented during our discussions of the year, namely the social and social services and the services in terms of health care. And I also believe that it is reasonable to include an study of the population in the role of our organization. In fact, and even though the problems are submitted to a commission that are made by the economic and social and social, it seems to be that they will also be interested in our organization. And, by the way, I am going to be able to reach to the end of the goal of our organization that we are going to be fixed by the préambule of our organization, such as the Committee of the Preparatory Committee of London. And that is the following, and I will remind you, the right to health is one of the fundamental rights that all human beings can be able to claim, whatever it is, its race, its religion, its political opinion, its economic and social conditions. The delegate from Peru, and the delegate from the Philippines, each has asked for the floor. I don't recall which is first. The delegate from Peru, I believe. The delegate from Peru, I believe. The speech was asked by Mr. President of Peru as by Mr. President of the Philippines. I don't remember the order in which they asked the speech, but it seems to me that the speech is to be a member of the President of Peru. Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President of Peru, Mr. President to serve hisRC But, pese a tan perentoria declaración, debo agregar a sí mismo que traigo no menos precisas instrucciones para que nuestro deseo de cooperación mundial se coordine dentro de nuestra condición de americanos solidarios con aquella institución que es la Oficina Sanitaria Panamericana de Washington, que es el foco central de nuestras determinaciones en la materia superior que aquí nos congrega. Pese a la recargada atención de los señores delegados aquí congregados, no voy a ofrecer un pequeño ordebre, sino una alegación fundada sobre cómo entendemos la cooperación mundial en materia de sanidad pública. La defensa de la Oficina Sanitaria Panamericana no necesita de abogados, le basta los creyentes que somos en su misión fundamental, convertible en organismo regional de los altos propósitos que aquí se están tratando de consagrar. Como creyente, pertenezco al templo que laboriosamente han edificado los pueblos del continente en medio siglo de fraternidad, no sólo geográfica e histórica, sino humana y social, y más que eso política, y por ser humana, social y política, profundamente ligada a la condición sanitaria de sus propios pueblos. Debo agregar que los pueblos pequeños, las naciones pequeñas, en periodo de crecimiento que vivimos en este hemisferio, mejor nos hallamos en el plano mundial cuando nos convertimos en americanos, en la ciudad de la Oficina Sanitaria Panamericana, en la ciudad de la Oficina Sanitaria Panamericana, que los océanos forman y delimitan, que una cordillera inacabable y continua, convierte en una inmensa unidad telúrica, y que ha hallado la firme unidad de sus pobladores, pese a sus fronteras, lo que ha permitido que el nuevo mundo sea la patria abierta para los hombres libres, de todo el planeta. Y allí, que cuando una de nuestras naciones, o uno de nosotros, invoca su condición de americano, en realidad, lo que afirma, es que se siente capaz de vivir en igualdad y en libertad, la gran vida solidaria del mundo, para beneficio universal. Una conclusión inobjetable deriva de este credo, para el caso concreto que aquí nos congrega, de servir a la vida sana de los pueblos de la tierra. Y es que para una cooperación efectiva, en el orden universal, no podemos privarnos nosotros, de nuestro doble carácter, de ciudadanos de esta o de aquella patria, pero de hijos del continente que completó las redondes del mundo. Más, no quiero hacer aquí, una invocación sentimental que estaría fuera de lugar. La oficina sanitaria panamericana, por cuya subsistencia expreso la opinión de mi gobierno, existe. Ha resistido al vendaval destructor de la guerra. Su vitalidad marcha de acuerdo con su desarrollo. Bajo su acción coordinadora no intrusora, todos los países del nuevo mundo han confundido sus procedimientos y sus normas en materia de sanidad pública. Esto ha sido un acto de libre determinación, no un movimiento derivado de impulsos primarios o de influencias extrañas a nuestro sentido de la soberanía política. Nuestra cooperación no es limosna ni repartimos la salud como una dádiva desde un Estado superior. Es el fruto de la cooperación común de nuestros pueblos libres que, pese a su estándar bajo de vida, pugnamos en igualdad de propósitos por levantarnos a la dignidad de la persona humana. Puedo decir, como testigo de excepción que soy, que las asambleas celebradas en las capitales de la América en los últimos 30 años, si han carecido del carácter ecuménico de esta asamblea que celebramos, han tenido siempre, no sólo las más amplias resonancias aún más allá del continente, sino que sus recomendaciones han sido actos para nuestros gobiernos cuando se ha tratado de defender la salud de sus pueblos. Pregunto, entonces, ¿cómo, por qué, abandonar esta línea de acción, esta línea de prudencia, si en su fondo está la realización efectiva de los nobles ideales que aquí triunfarán para afirmar que el mundo fraternizará en defensa de la vida, como desde hace medio siglo fraternizan los 300 millones de hombres que somos los americanos, hermanos ansiosos de vivir con aquellos de donde descendemos y con los que nos ligan la cultura y elementales razones de fraternidad mundial? Concluyo, señores delegados, pido y sostengo como una necesidad esencial para la vivacidad y la eficiencia de la organización mundial que toméis en cuenta que la OSPA, la Oficina Sanitaria Panamericana, es una entidad viva, es una entidad viva que debe ser convertible en la parte de la unidad mundial. No ambicionamos ser el cerebro, apenas si queremos ser el corazón del organismo que aquí están haciendo a la sombra propicia de esta tierra de libertad, la tierra de Washington, de Lincoln, que hermanó a los hombres pese a sus razas, de Belch que mostró los caminos de la investigación y de Gorgas que aplicó lo que sabía esta nueva tierra para la redención de la vía abierta a los caminos del mundo. Entonces, estoy seguro, señores, de que la América, confundida dentro del organismo mundial, gracias a su propio espíritu, podrá asistir al magnífico alumbramiento de la hora de paz con la que todos soñamos. A delegado de la Filipina, Dr. Lana. A delegado de la Filipina, la Filipina, la delegación de la Filipina reconoce que la verdadera de la publicidad se va a conocer con la aceptación entre los trabajadores y extracción en preventiva medicina y sanitaria science. So, cuando se va a conocer la delegación de otras naciones en unanimidad aceptar a la base de la conferencia. ¿Vale? Do you render that in English? The delegate of Argentina said that he spoke in Spanish because of the provision which I just mentioned a moment ago. And he is very sorry that no, his secretariat didn't have the facilities for doing that. But he only wishes that such facilities could be provided soon. A los que hablan español sobre mi protesta me ha pedido el señor presidente, el doctor Parran, que les diga a ustedes que él lamenta mucho no haber podido tener en la secretaría los elementos necesarios para hacer la traducción inmediata de acuerdo con lo que prevén los reglamentos. Pero que ellos esperan que esta tarde nosotros, los que hablamos en español, podamos tener traductores que lleven al inglés y al francés para conocimiento de los demás miembros. Gracias. Le dénigre de l'Argentine a indiqué que s'il a parlé en español c'est que les dispositions du règlement intérieur le lui permettaient. Il regrette que le secretariat n'ait pas prévu cela et n'ait pas pris les dispositions nécessaires afin d'assurer l'interprétation des discours prononcés en español. Il espère que le secretariat prendra les mesures nécessaires à cet effet de cet après-midi. En cuanto le secretariat a puissé reconnaître les délégués, il n'y a qu'un délégué qui a demandé de parler, un délégué de Lebanon. A cette époque, il y a un délégué qui souhaite parler au sujet dont nous discutons ce matin, s'il vous plaît indique par le signo qui est devant vous. Pour le moment, il y a un seul délégué qui est fait part encore à la présidence de son désir de parler, c'est M. le délégué du Liban. Et je demande à présent à ceux d'entre les délégués qui voudraient encore prononcer une déclaration sur le point 6 de l'ordre du jour de bien vouloir l'indiquer au président en élevant le signe qui est devant leur place et qui donne le nom de leur pays au-dessus de leur tête. Le délégué de la Corée a fait part de son désir de parler. Is there anyone else who would wish to speak to this general subject? If not, the chair recognizes the delegate from Lebanon. Dr. Heiken. I beg your pardon. Delegate from Norway. From Norway. Certainly. I would like to say what was the final decision on the speech given by the after the second problem by the group put the whole on the step of the third extension. Mr. President, je voudrais faire une remarque sur deux points d'ordre. En effet, je ne me rends pas bien compte quelle a été la décision finale qui a été prise au sujet des discours prononcés par messieurs les délégués de l'Argentine et du Pérou. Et je voudrais vous demander si la conférence aura tout le bénéfice des discours qui ont été prononcés par ces délégués et de ces discours in extenso. Messieurs, messieurs, je dois d'abord m'excuser au nom du secrétariat de l'impossibilité dans laquelle nous avons été de vous donner tout à fait contrairement à notre désir une interprétation en français et en anglais des discours qui ont été prononcés ce matin en espagnol. La raison en est essentiellement dans le fait qu'actuellement à Hunter College se réunissent simultanément contrairement aux prévisions les organismes les plus importants des Nations Unies, le Conseil économique et sociale et le Conseil de sécurité sans parler de la commission atomique et encore d'une quatrième commission. J'espère que cette situation anormale dans laquelle nous sommes trouvés aujourd'hui aura sa solution cet après-midi et j'ai demandé que cette solution soit prise d'urgence. Néanmoins, pour parer aux défauts de la traduction espagnole ce matin, d'une part, nous aurons le texte, nous aurons une traduction en français et en anglais ultérieure de ce qui a été enregistré des déclarations faites en espagnol aujourd'hui ou si les auteurs le préfèrent, quand nous aurons leur texte écrit, cette traduction sera faite d'après leur texte écrit. Mais en tout cas, vous pouvez être assuré qu'au cours d'une des séances prochaines, les membres de cette conférence auront la totalité et en français et en anglais des observations faites par leurs collègues en langue espagnole. Gentlemen, I would like to apologize in the name of the Secretariat for the impossibility of supplying this conference with the interpretation into English and into French of speeches pronounced in Spanish. The reason for this abnormality is that at this very moment at Hunter College there are meetings of the most important organs of the United Nations, the Economic and Social Council, the Security Council and the Committee on Atomic Energy, which were not foreseen before. This abnormal situation I hope will be improved this very afternoon. However, I can promise you that we will have the translation into French and into English of the speeches made in Spanish which will have been registered on records. If the authors of these speeches would like to give us their written text, the translations will be made from these written text. I repeat, in one of our next meetings, the delegates will have the full text of the Spanish speeches. In answer to Dr. Yvang's question then, it is my understanding that these speeches will be translated and mimeographed and circulated but will not be presented verbally in English and in French since the speakers themselves did not insist that that be done. In response to the question which was asked by Dr. Yvang, I would like to to tell you that the speeches which were pronounced this morning by the two delegates will be translated in English and French, will be mimographed and distributed to several delegations. But these speeches will not be repeated in their translations in oral language since the two delegates have agreed to this subject. The delegate from Lebanon. La parole est à monsieur le délégué du Liban. Dr. Heike. Fellow delegates, as delegates of Lebanon, I wish to congratulate the Technical Preparatory Committee for their excellent report. and to declare that Lebanon supports wholeheartedly the establishment of a world health organization with the aim of bringing about the fullest possible positive cooperation among nations in the field of health. By virtue of its geographic location and with the help of the two medical schools of the two universities in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, Lebanon is capable of playing an important role in the promotion of health. Lebanon is located on the eastern Mediterranean at the crossroads of the three continents of Europe, Asia and Africa. Its two medical schools have for the last 70 years trained physicians who have served the cause of health all over the Near East. I have only one general observation to make on the proposed constitution of the World Health Organization. Lebanon is in favor of organizing effective regional arrangements to the fullest possible extent. As a member of the Arab League, Lebanon is already engaged in organizing common action in the field of health with the other Arab states. Finally, we in Lebanon realize the great benefits which we will derive from international health cooperation. As a small nation, we have much to profit from advances in medical science made in the great nations. Our great desire and hope is that the World Health Organization which we are going to establish will undertake positive constructive action in spreading the benefits of scientific progress to the less advanced territories all over the world. At the same time that the United Nations are engaged in the great task of establishing permanent peace and putting an end to the struggle of man against man, let us fellow delegates put all our efforts to the task of organizing the struggle against disease and so as to ensure good health and well-being for all men of all nations. Thank you. Mr. President, Messieurs, au nom du gouvernement de la République du Liban, je voudrais exprimer les félicitations à la conférence préparatoire de Paris pour le travail remarquable qu'elle a fourni. Le gouvernement libanais soutiendra de tous ses efforts et de toute sa volonté l'œuvre de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé. Située sur les bords orientaux de la Méditerranée, à la croisée des chemins des trois continents européens, asiatiques et africains, le Liban, grâce à la présence de deux écoles de médecine dans ses deux universités de Beyrouth, sa capitale, est capable de jouer un rôle important dans l'Organisation mondiale de la santé et entend bien s'acquitter de ce devoir. Je n'ai qu'une observation à faire. Le Liban est fortement en faveur de la conclusion d'accords régionaux étroits et pratiques. Membre de la Ligue Panarabe, il a de son côté déjà engagé les pourparlers pour que dans la sphère ainsi définie, cette collaboration puisse s'appuyer. Le Liban est un petit pays. Cependant, depuis 70 ans, ces deux universités ont procédé à l'éducation des médecins qui ont pu jouer un rôle important dans l'organisation des mesures sanitaires dans le Proche-Orient et dans les pays avoisinants. Petit pays, nous savons nous-mêmes combien nous avons à profiter de l'aide que pourra apporter à l'œuvre générale le travail de toutes les bonnes volontés internationales unies dans ce but. Au moment où les hommes d'État des grands puissances sont réunis pour étudier les problèmes qui visent l'établissement de la paix et dont le but est de mettre fin à la lutte des hommes contre les hommes, soyons conscients de la grandeur de la tâche qui nous incombe, de façon à ce que dans le domaine qui nous est propre, nous puissions étendre cette collaboration pour le bien supérieur de l'humanité. La parole est à monsieur le délégué de la Corée. Mexico et la multipl superb Сам. Dr. Choi. Friends, Korea is one of the unfortunate nations of the world, a neglected and ill-treated member of the family of nations. She has just been liberated from the evil hands of oppression. But her self-government has not yet been established, although she looks forward eagerly to its organization in the near future. The American military government in Korea, which is temporarily in charge of the southern half of the country, recognizes the importance of its meeting of the International Health Conference. So a delegate was sent, even as an observer, to be present in the meeting to learn its aims, functions, and activities. I can assure you that when the Korean government is legally established and recognized, this government will be wealthy. It has been suggested that the nominations be closed and the Secretary cast the ballot of the Committee for the unanimous election of General Chisholm as Chairman of Committee 2. Is there an objection? The President hears no objection and General Chisholm is unanimously elected as Chairman of Committee 2. The President will ask him to come forward and take the chair. The President will ask him to come forward and take the chair. The President doesn't have any objection. The Dr. Chisholm is elected to the President of Committee 2, and the President will ask him to be able to be able to take place in the presidential chair. Yes, I shall. Before turning over the chair to General Chisholm, I would ask his indulgence to adjourn his committee this afternoon in sufficient time for this committee to reconvene as a plenary session for two purposes. One, to hear the report of your committee on rules of procedure under the chairmanship of Dr. Kev Aon, and two, to elect the additional remaining officers of this conference pursuant to the rules of procedure which I assume will be adopted. Avant de passer la présidence de ce comité à M. le Dr. Chisholm, je voudrais lui demander son indulgence et lui demander de faire le nécessaire pour que son comité s'ajourne en temps utile afin de nous permettre de nous réunir à nouveau sous la forme d'une séance plénière pour les deux points suivants qui figurent à notre ordre du jour. Le premier sera l'examen du rapport concernant le règlement intérieur qui a été élaboré par la commission qui a siégé hier sous la présidence du Dr. Cavaillon. Et le second sera de procéder à l'élection des membres du bureau restant encore à élire conformément à votre règlement intérieur qui, je l'espère, aura auparavant reçu votre approbation. I have the honour of presenting to you the chairman of Committee 2, General Chisholm of Canada. J'ai l'honneur de vous présenter le président de votre comité numéro 2, le général Chisholm du Canada. Mr. President, colleagues, may I thank you most sincerely for the honour you do me in electing me chairman of this committee. The work that we are to do now is very important indeed. It considers sections numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15 of the work of the preparatory committee. I think I should ask the secretary now to read section number 5, after which we will invite three discussions of this section. Mr. President, I thank you all for the honor you made in the place of the president of the commission number 2. The work that is in front of us is extremely important, as it concerns sections 5 and 14 of the report of the Committee of the Committee. I ask Mr. Secretary to be able to read first of section 5. The commission number 5 is related to the Lab . The work that is the series of operas zuges is distinguished. The function of theNothingSeamMonster.

And the other point is, ought we not to add, in place of, as the new D, and such committees as may be set up under the authority of the conference, or a phrase of that kind. I think it would make a more complete administrative set up. Mr. De Remarque, about the text that has been read, is it not to reunite in one single paragraph the Director General and the Secretariat, as we will meet later on the paragraph 8, where we also talk about the Director General and the Secretariat? On the other hand, is there not a more, in this case, to see a new D, since the D will disappear, and other committees that could be created at the diligence of the Council? Section 6. Conférence Mondiale de la Santé. Primo. Composition. La conférence devrait être composée de délégués des États membres. Petit B. Chaque État membre devrait être représenté par trois délégués au plus, l'un d'entre eux étant désigné par l'État membre comme chef de délégation. 2. Variante. Chaque État membre devrait être représenté par un délégué. C. Des suppléants et des conseillers pourraient accompagner les délégués. D. Dans le choix de leur délégué, les États membres devraient dûment tenir compte de la nature technique du travail de l'organisation. Il y a une variante sur ce point. Le délégué devait être choisi parmi les personnalités les plus qualifiées par leurs compétences techniques dans le domaine de la santé et qui, de préférence, représenterait l'administration nationale de la santé de l'État membre. Petit E. Chaque État membre devrait avoir droit à une voix au sein de la conférence. Je vais vous mettre clair. C. Paragraphe de la section 6. Composition. C. La conférence doit être composée par des délégués pour les États membres. B. 1. Chaque État membre devrait être représenté par non plus que trois délégués, un de qui devrait être délicaté par les États membres. ou, alternative, chaque État membre devrait être représenté par un délégué. C. Alternatifs et advisors may être permis de accompagner les délégués. D. 1. En selecant leurs délégués, les délégués de la santé de l'État membre devrait être payé par les États membres pour la technique nature du travail de l'État. C. C. L'État membre devrait être choisissé par des personnes les plus qualifiées par leur technique de compétence dans le domaine de la santé, préférée par la santé de l'État de l'État. E. Chaque État membre devrait avoir un vote dans la conférence. C. La discussion or comment on this section and particularly the alternative wordings. M. Y a-t-il d'observations sur ce texte et en particulier en ce qui concerne les deux alternatives proposées? Delegate from India. M. M. le délégué des Indes. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. that we adopt the first of the two alternatives given here, which reads that each Member State should be represented by not more than three delegates, one of whom should be designated by the Member State as Chief Delegate. I do not think the other alternative, which gives us just one Member, is sufficient. For various reasons, it would be necessary for a delegation to be stronger than just one Member. I therefore suggest to the meeting here that we have our decision in favor of alternative A. Going on alternative one of B, sorry, going on next to item C, alternates and advisors may be permitted to accompany delegates. I think there's presumably no discussion on that. Alternates and advisors are always necessary, and they should be appointed. Sub-Para D again gives us two alternatives. One is that the delegates should be selected with due regard to the technical nature of the work of the organization. This paragraph would give the State's concern the power to appoint almost anybody, whether he be a member of his country's health services or not. He may be a professor of pathology, for instance. We felt very much while we were discussing this problem in the technical committee, of which I had the honor of being a member, that it was very desirable for States to send men as far as possible who would represent their country's health services. Those are the men we felt very strongly who hold positions of responsibility. They are the men who are used to taking decisions every day and implementing them. And if these men would be sent by their country to a body like the one we are now contemplating, it is only then that we are likely to get practical results and not otherwise. Otherwise, I suggest the discussions might easily become academic and we might not get very far. I therefore propose, with your permission, that we should go in for alternative D2, which reads, the delegate should be chosen from among persons most qualified by their technical competence in the health field, preferably representing the National Health Administration of the member State. It gives the State a lead as to the type of men they have to send. It doesn't necessarily compel them because we cannot compel the State to do anything. That is simply asking for trouble. I therefore propose to the Committee here that we go in for alternative D2. As regards E, that again is non-contentious, I submit, that each member State should have one vote in the conference. Nothing else could possibly make us finish our work or come to any decision if any State is going to have more than one vote. In the section 6, here are some words of observation. In the section A, the conference should be composed of the D2 members. There is no doubt about the need to accept this rule. We are, under the B, in two variants. The first, B, one of the states should be represented by three D2 members. The second, each state should be represented by one D2 members. I ask for the variant 2, since for the work that is possible, it will be necessary for the D2 members to be composed of a higher number of D2 members. In the section C, we are, under the first, in the first place, in the first place, we must be able to design the supplant and the conseiller. We are, under the two alternatives. The first, which is the first, which is the first to leave the different governments the attitude on their choice of their délégués. The second, which is the second, which is the second, which is the second rule. I believe that we must decide in favor of the second alternative. In the case of the other, the state could design a man with a technical ability, such as a pathologist, but not necessarily in his place in an administrative organization. What we want, before all, is that the different states be represented as much as possible by the representatives of their national health services. I ask you to decide in favor of the alternative 2. Finally, in the last paragraph, 1, attribuant to each member a single one in the conference. It has been suggested that the nominations be closed and the secretary cast the ballot of the committee for the unanimous election of General Chisholm as chairman of the committee 2. Is there objection? The president hears no objection, and General Chisholm is unanimously elected as chairman of committee 2. The president will ask him to come forward and take the chair. Yes, I shall. Yes, I shall. Congratulations, I shall. Before turning over the chair to General Chisholm, I would ask his indulgence to return, to adjourn his committee this afternoon in sufficient time for this committee to reconvene as a plenary session for two purposes. One, to hear the report of your committee on rules of procedure under the chairmanship of Dr. Kev Aon, and two, to elect the additional remaining offices of this conference pursuant to the rules of procedure, which I assume will be adopted. Before I introduce the committee to Mr. Chisholm, I would ask him to ask him to do the necessary to make the necessary to ensure that his committee should be in a useful time to allow us to join us again in a form of a plenary session for the two points that are in our day. The first one will be the assessment of the report concerning the inter-regulation which has been elaborated by the commission which has been suggested yesterday on the presidency of Dr. Cavaillon, and the second one will be the second one to proceed to the election of the members of the board of the board that is still being held according to your internal regulation which, I hope, has received your approval. I have the honour of presenting to you the chairman of the committee 2, General Chisholm of Canada. Mr. President, colleagues, may I thank you most sincerely for the honour you do me in electing me chairman of this committee. The work that we are to do now is very important indeed. It considers sections numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, and 15 of the work of the preparatory committee. I think I should ask the secretary now to read section number 5 after which we'll invite free discussion of this section. Mr. President, I thank you all for the honour that you have made in my mind to be in place of the president of the committee number 2. The work that is before us is extremely important since it concerns the sections 5, 14 of the report of the committee preparatory of Paris. I ask Mr. Secretary to be able to give you the lecture of the section 5. The section 5 is the organ of the World Health Organization. The function of the World Health Organization, the organization, the organization, the organization, the organization, the organization, the A, the World Health Organization, the conference, the B, the executive executive, the Council, the C, the director general, D, the secretariat. The of the report concerns the organs of the new organization. The reads as follows. The work of the World Health Organization, herein after called the organization, should be carried out by A, the World Health Conference, herein after called the conference, B, the executive board, herein after called the board, C, the director general, D, the secretariat. The director general, the secretary general, the executive board, the executive board, the executive board, the executive board, the executive board. Do you have any discussion on the board? The executive board, may I invite discussion on section number 5, organs of the World Health Organization. The delegate from the UK. The delegate from the UK, The delegate from the UK. The delegate from the UK. There are two points, Mr. Chairman. Ought not C and D to be combined in accordance with Article 8 a little further on? It describes its Director General and the Secretariat. I think it's just a drafting method. And the other point is, ought we not to add, in place of the new D, and such committees as may be set up under the authority of the Conference of, a phase of that kind? I think it would make a more complete administrative set-up. It would be created by the Council of the Council. Section 6. Conférence mondiale de la santé. Primo. Composition. La conférence devrait être composée de délégués des États membres. Petit B. Chaque État membre devrait être représenté par trois délégués au plus, l'un d'entre eux étant désigné par l'État membre comme chef de délégation. Deux. Variante. Chaque État membre devrait être représenté par un délégué. C. C. Des suppléants et des conseillers pourraient accompagner les délégués. D. Dans le choix de leurs délégués, les États membres devraient dûment tenir compte de la nature technique du travail de l'organisation. Il y a une variante sur ce point. Le délégué devait être choisi parmi les personnalités les plus qualifiées par leurs compétences techniques dans le domaine de la santé et qui, de préférence, représenterait l'administration nationale de la santé de l'État membre. Petit E. Chaque État membre devrait avoir droit à une voix au sein de la conférence. La conférence doit être composée par des délégués pour les États membres. B. 1. Chaque État membre devrait être représenté par non plus que trois délégués, un de qui devrait être délicaté par les États membres comme chef de délégué. Ou, alternative, chaque État membre devrait être représenté par un délégué. C. Alternates and advisors may be permitted to accompany the delegates. D. 1. In selecting their delegates, due regard should be paid by the Member States to the technical nature of the work of the organisation. That's an alternative. A delegate should be chosen from among persons most qualified by their technical competence in the health field, preferably representing the National Health Administration of the Member States. E. Each Member State should have one vote in the conference. A discussion or comment on this section and particularly the alternative wordings. Delegate from India. Delegate from India. Delegate from India. agriculture. S'il te plaise. je te la problème. Monsieur le Président, car Réолодine Iiga Degoutini, 6th World Health Conference, I suggest that in A, and the conference should be composed of delegates for member states, there is presumably no discussion, there can be no other composition possible as far as I understand, and we might now proceed to B, which gives us two alternatives. I suggest that we adopt the first of the two alternatives given here, which reads that each member state should be represented by not more than three delegates, one of whom should be designated by the member state as chief delegate. I do not think the other alternative which gives us just one member is sufficient. For various reasons, it would be necessary for a delegation to be stronger than just one member. I therefore suggest to the meeting here that we have our decision in favor of alternative A. Going on alternative one of B, sorry, going on next to item C, alternates and advisors may be permitted to accompany delegates. I think there is presumably no discussion on that. Alternates and advisors are always necessary, and they should be appointed. Subparadhi, again, gives us two alternatives. One is that the delegates should be selected with due regard to the technical nature of the work of the organization. This paragraph would give the state's concern the power to appoint almost anybody, whether he be a member of his country's health services or not. He may be a professor of pathology, for instance. We felt very much while we were discussing this problem in the technical committee, of which I had the honor of being a member, that was very desirable for states to send men as far as possible who would represent their country's health services. Those are the men, we felt very strongly, who hold positions of responsibility. They are the men who are used to taking decisions every day and implementing them. And if these men would be sent by their countries to a body like the one we are now contemplating, it is only then that we are likely to get practical results and not otherwise. Otherwise, I suggest that the discussions might easily become academic and we might not get very far. I therefore propose, with your permission, that we should go in for alternative D2, which reads, the delegate should be chosen from among persons most qualified by their technical competence in the health field, preferably representing the National Health Administration of the member state. It gives the state a lead as to the type of men they have to send. It doesn't necessarily compel them because we cannot compel the state to do anything. That is simply asking for trouble. I therefore propose to the committee here that we go in for alternative D2. As regards E, that again is non-contentious, I submit that each member state should have one vote in the conference. Nothing else could possibly make us finish our work or come to any decision if any state is going to have more than one vote. In the section 6, here are some words of observation. In the paragraph A, the conference should be composed of the delegates and the members. There is no doubt about the need to accept this rule. We are, in the letter B, in the first two variants. The first, B-V, that the one would be represented by three delegates. The second, each member would be represented by one delegates. I ask the variant 2, because to make the work of the work that is necessary to be composed of a number more high. In the second, the paragraph C, we are, in the first place, we have to be able to design the supplant and the conseiller. We are, in the first place, the first, which is the first, which is the first, which is the first, which is the first, which is the the second, which is the second, which is the second, which is the second, which is the certain rule. I believe that we must decide in favor of the second, in the second, the other way. In the other hand, the state could design a man with a technicality, such as a pathologist, but not necessarily in a place in an administrative organization. What we want, before all, is that the different États are represented as much as possible by the representatives of their national services. I ask you, so, to decide in favor of the alternative 2. Enfin, in the last, in the last paragraph E, attribuant to each member one single one in the conference, the second, which is the of the other hand. This is still a clear truth. We will not hold any serious if the state could be able to use several voices. The chair recognizes the United States of America. The word is Mr. the delegate of the United States. Chairman, I would like to support the the proposal made by the delegate of India with respect to paragraph B1. That is, that the conference should approve this first alternative here with respect to the composition of the delegation. Under paragraph B1, this would permit sending to the World Health Conference, a more broadly representative delegation than provided for in B2. Inclusion of the latter provision in the Constitution would force upon governments a choice between a representative of the National Health Service, a representative of the government outside of its its primary health agency or a representative of non-governmental health interests. It is possible in certain countries that such a narrowing of selection might, for political or personal reasons, result in the exclusion from the World Health Conference of the person or persons in a position to carry out most effectively the decisions of the conference as they affect national action. The provision for alternates and advisors does not rectify this situation because it fails to provide full dignity and full participation to persons of exceptional value to the conference. Now, with respect to the second point here of the second alternative under D1 and D2, D1 provides that in selecting their delegates due regard should be paid by the member states to the technical nature of the work of the organization. With respect to this provision, the United States delegation would support the adoption of this first alternative rather than the second as suggested by the the delegate of the delegate of the delegate of the delegate of the delegate of India. The United States would approve of this provision or would prefer this provision since it would allow governments more latitude in the selection of delegates than would the second alternative. The latter alternative takes into account only technical qualifications in the field of health overlooking other qualifications which a person might have as a spokesman for his government and as a government and as a participant in an international conference. For that reason, we would prefer the first alternative under subparagraph D. The new 언 I? I Mesuelle Demonyme Cρα titWS. The United States would be in favor of the adoption of the proposal of the President of the United States in terms of the alternative 1 for the paragraph B. In fact, not only in a more than a more large representation, the different countries would be more representative, but we would avoid the danger that for some reasons, the people who could play a important role in the organization could be excluded. We can imagine that there are countries where political reasons could play in this sense. In terms of the proposal made by Mr. Dedeck and the Indes of adoption the 2 for the paragraph D, the American American, in favor, is in favor of the 1. He is indeed in favor of the 2. He is in favor of the 2. The 2. The 2. The 2. The 2. The 2. The 2. The 2. The 2. The 2. Chairman, I should like to make two remarks concerning the same points as I mentioned by the delegates of India and the United States. In the first place, as far as concerned, I believe it makes no great difference, the first or the second solution. What is the difference? In the first case, you will have to send three delegates, one is head of the delegation and the only voting man. In the second case, one is delegate, the only voting man, the head, and the other are the alternates. I don't see that there is a real great distinction and I should like to see this question explained. The Netherlands delegation does not understand what is its distinction. As far as concerned, the second question, I believe, the opinion of the Netherlands delegation, that the government should be fully free to send the persons that are considered by the government as the most competent man. For instance, we in our Dutch delegation, we are very glad that we have in our delegation today, Professor van Lochem of the University of Amsterdam, very competent for various questions here to be discussed in our conference, and who is not a man who is in the public health service in the Netherlands. And we should be glad that we should have in the future also the possibility to have men of this kind in our delegation. Mr. Mr. Monsieur, in the second case, I will say that I don't understand the distinction that we hear from the alternative 1 and 2 for what is the paragraph B. The first one said that they could have three employees. The one would be named the clerk-alms of the owner and the two directors would name the owner. The second one area of that they could nam therett- Bubble-Conём and Ning É. It is therefore one. It would be then demandé of 아니면 the judge-alms of theandid針 rule to set the segue and the other. I don't know therefore how, in the practical terms, the distinction that we tend to establishait is precisely Mr. President of the United States. I believe it is necessary to leave the government all freedom for their choice of their elected and that to impose certain conditions would not be for the good of the organization. Let me give an example. We have with us Mr. Professor Van Lorhem of the University of Amsterdam. This is not an man who occupies a official situation in the field of public health. We are extremely happy to have to be able to prevail from his advice and advice. I believe it would be better to hold the formula number one. Mr. President of the United States. Mr. President of the United States. Mr. President of the United States. The point number one that we are discussing in this moment. I personally think that the solution is to say that each member should be represented by three of us. The fish will control the concern, which is called the mic. This officer comes from unl pre président Ohio, won the feeling from the deutschen hospital who jumped to której 있었.�� tune of two spectators plus support and lorsqu further expert höated soy silo a authority, a possibility to speak and listen to more attention than simply the supplant or the conseiller of his délégués. This is perhaps only a small thing, but it also helps, however, the choice very delicate for governments to design their délégués. A government can, without difficulty, design three délégués, among the ones one president of délégation, than only a chief of délégation unique délégué and the conseiller. But in reality, this is not a considerable importance. On the contrary, for the point number two, I am sorry to mention personally, and I apologize for speaking personally, and I know that it is also the point of view of my government, I attache an important importance. In fact, we think that if the health organization should really represent the interests of the health, it is necessary to do it by the means of the person who qualifies. Or, for too long, the public health health has been considered, in many countries, as a thing that, in many countries, as a thing that, in many countries, was not always worthy of what people who have been concerned. And in many countries, the interests of the health care were not given to the doctors, well, into telepaid bringing up any questions or feedbacks. I don't like to andere advisors Sarah, asب veille the health care a very important, as well as as a benefit,�로���. Anyway, the whole Tac in said, is not to go away from the practices, through thousands of times, or than an além of several times, the agencies that are often very difficult, or a very니legation, We know that even some states are not always decided to do it. And in these conditions, we must consider that in many cases, governments tend to be represented at the health conference by the person who will simply be represented diplomatically of the country in which the conference is held. I have no objection against the diplomats but these conferences have not for the purpose of reuniting for questions of health, they have for the purpose of reuniting for questions of health, sanitaires. Or, if we don't do any attention, and if we follow the opinion which is supported by our colleagues from the United States, we risk. Without a doubt, I understand very well that the United States doesn't see the same thing as we. The United States are a very rich, very rich and very puissant country. In the United States, they will always have the possibility to send the people qualified qualified. But many nations, the United States, or little or small, will not have the possibility. And we risk, when we will have 60 délégués of 60 different countries, to find, perhaps, we, health care, we, health care, a minority in the middle of the people who have no technical skills. I hear that the proposal made by the United States and by a part of the members of the conference of the experts at Paris says that in the choice of their délégués, the États members have to do not have a sense of the technical work of the organization. Yes, gentlemen, but it is a recommendation that is very seriously to be platonic, to remain the most. We had asked at Paris, in reality, to at least a certain number of us, we had asked even more than what is in the alternative in the variant 2. We had asked to be obligated to be a right in the delegation of the direct general of the health care of the country of the country of the country. We had to be reminded that it was really a part of our own country. We had to be a part of our own country and that it was possible to not be liable to not be liable to be a part of our own country. We were inclined to be inclined but finally, really, what is the objection can be made reasonable in taking care of the observations that I just presented to be a part of of the people who are qualified by their technical skills since it is a technical skill and that, in prefer, would be a part of the national of the health care of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the people who are treated at the same time. It seems to be that it is only in these conditions that we can really do good work. And it is also that I would like to be a part of the first question that I would like to have three because if we have three of the people we can always hope to have among these three of the people there will be always someone of the job. I apologize for being too long. I strongly that we could have wanted to be to have wanted to have wanted to be a person to have preach for my sake, as we say in France. But finally, I believe that when we want to eat good food, we should be to a cook. the first point we are discussing. I personally am inclined to, um, uh, that we should take the text which foresees three delegates. Evidently, as the previous speaker indicated, there is not much difference between three delegates or one delegate plus, uh, two alternates. However, the fact, the fact of being a delegate gives certain authority and gives a better possibility of expressing his views than, uh, the fact of being an alternate. Uh, it may be a little thing, but often we should foresee that it will make it easier for a government to, uh, to appoint three delegates than to appoint one, uh, delegate, uh, with alternates. Uh, uh, when the, one of these three will be appointed, uh, chief of delegation, of the delegation. Uh, I admit, however, that it is not so important. To the contrary, the second point we are discussing is, uh, in my personal view, and I apologize for expressing my personal views, though I am sure that this is also the view of my government. I attach very great importance to this second point. When we, uh, uh, when we say that we want persons technically qualified, we mean to have among our delegates persons duly qualified. However, in many countries, the public health services, well, are not always considered to be, uh, so very, uh, important and war-to-war end. Therefore, in many countries, not necessarily medical and sanitary authorities are in charge of these services, and often we have purely administrative officers in charge of these services. However, we want here public health to be represented by representatives of medical science and of sanitary services. Another factor, um, can come in, and this is the question of expense. And therefore, we could expect that in many cases the governments to save expense will have the tendency of being represented by their usual diplomatic representatives in the country where the conference is going to be held. However, I have no objections against, uh, diplom-diplomates. However, our task is to deal with health questions. And if we do not pay any, uh, due attention to the, uh, to the choice of the delegates, we may find that among the delegates, uh, delegates, we haven't got enough persons duly qualified for this war. I understand the point of view of the United States delegate. The United States is a great, rich country and will always be able to appoint, uh, the delegates which they will find the most necessary for this war. However, in the case of smaller countries, there always is a risk that they will find, uh, it easier to appoint their regular diplomatic representatives. And in such a way, we may, uh, be faced with a situation that among 60 delegates of 60 countries, we will have only a minority of medical and sanitary officials. And a minority among, a majority of non-medical officials. Therefore, I am afraid that the suggestion of the United States delegate that we should, uh, shall approve the first, um, first alternative of point D, in selecting their delegates, due regard shall be paid by the member states to the technical nature of the work of the organization, may remain a very, just a platonic suggestion. In Paris, we demanded more than it is included even in the alternative two. We wanted to make this obligatory, make it necessary that the delegation should ex officio include the director of public health services of the particular country. We agreed not to insert this, but we do not see what objections there could be against the second alternative in the text, which says that the delegate should be chosen from among persons most qualified by the technical competence in the health field, preferably representing the National Health Administration of the member state. We come here to deal with questions of public health. We should be represented here by persons who deal with the same questions at home. This is the only way to assure good work in our conferences. Therefore, I again would like to support the possibility of having three delegates because there is always a hope that among three delegates there will be at least one professionally qualified from point of view of medical services. I want to apologize for being long and I understand that myself being an official of public health I may be suspected of being prejudiced. However, I think this solution is the best. If you want good cooking, we always have to ask a good cook to do our cooking. The chair recognizes the delegate from Cuba. The word is to Mr. Delegate from Cuba. Mr. President, Mr. Delegate, Mr. Delegate, Mr. Delegate, Mr. President, about the democations for the Thanksgiving Committee. The decision to do I have understood yesterday that Dr. Parran had clearly expressed that the proposals that were studied here, if they were approved in this plenary session, would be only temporary or tentative, but never definitively, but that they would be in the different committees when they were created. However, today, as we see, the proposals, if they are approved, will be definitively. The Cubans consider this point essential, since they were estimated that the committees should not be integrated by the total members, but by small committees, as always happens in the Congresses or conferences of this type of international. I would like to know what is the point of view of the Presidency today, if these proposals are definitively or continue to be, as Dr. Parran said yesterday, only in a temporary way. Is there any interpreters? Dr. Bustamante, who has been good enough to offer his services this afternoon until we can get proper interpretation from the Secretariat. I ask Mr. Bustamante to ensure the translation as he wanted to offer it, until we have able to ensure the award of a qualified interpreter. I will, before I start, thank you very much for the kindness of the the President and the President of the President. I would like to thank him very sincerely for his ability in taking over the services which the Secretariat should provide. Thank you, Mr. Bustamante. As a delegate from Cuba, I want to ask the President if the discussions this afternoon are going to follow the same indication that Dr. Parran made yesterday afternoon, that is, that the session was going to follow, in general view point, the different points that we have on the different points of the program and that there could be made some amendments and some modifications afterwards. We wish to know if this procedure has been changed because it seems to the Cuban delegation that this afternoon the discussions are going in a more definite and precise way than it was followed yesterday afternoon. We wish to know if this procedure has been modified so that instead of having the small committees like it is usual in every conference or congress to do, to have these discussions in small groups or if in the other way this afternoon we are going to have this working group go into detail and go into definite modifications of the points of the agenda. Monsieur, je voudrais poser à Monsieur le Président la question suivante. Est-ce qu'il a l'intention de maintenir les errements qui ont été établis hier par Monsieur le Président, le Docteur, le Médecins Général de Barane, in the sense that we would not do that, after the observations and amendments. I ask this question because it seems to me that the discussion which is engaged here is to nature to enter more profondément in the details that we had done yesterday. I would like to know, in order to fix my own attitude, if we will continue with a deep discussion or if we will have the concerns of the issue, as it is often used, the care to do it to more restricted groups. The situation is still not quite clear of course. There are still certain delegations that have not arrived. On the other hand, it would seem desirable that we should get as much of this detailed work out of the way as possible. Although these suggestions and recommendations that are being made today will, I suppose, be considered in the light of any further recommendations which delegations arriving later may want to make. Therefore, it seems to me we should not irrevocably adopt any particular part of these recommendations, but should consider them now and continue in committee with any additions that may be made later. I think, however, this is very valuable to do it this way and that we do have the feelings of a considerable number of people and particularly it will be valuable if anyone voices any objections they have now or any contrary opinions to those stated by anyone else. Then, as other opinions are added, the committee can consider them as a whole and draft them into some sort of shape. The situation is not yet clear. There are indeed a certain number of delegations that have not yet arrived and that should still be able to participate in the debate. On the other hand, I believe it is not bad that we can enter here in some details on the subject of the questions which are raised before the conference, without the agreement, without the agreement, of course, that no decision definitive could be taken and that it would always be to be able to return to the discussions which would be instaurated here at the light of new proposals which could be presented. By this way, I believe that we could continue the way we have done now and take advantage of the presence of many delegations to allow the conference to LETTERI THE BROADD WRIGHT THE PRESIDENT I want only to make a few remarks regarding these two points, as we have discussed in Paris. And I think they are very much linked together, not only this point B, one, and B and the alternatives, and D and the two alternatives, but already the chapter five that we already discussed, and a note on page 145 of our document, discussed in Paris at the Technical Preparatory Commission, in which we see the note, in which we see the possibility in the future of creating a general advisory committee. We have discussed this in Paris very fully, and I think my delegation is in favor, of the existence of three delegates instead of one. That would give the opportunity in any delegation to have, very probably, one person with technical administrative responsibility in the delegation that may carry on the decisions of any of the International Health Conference attended. If, in regard to the paragraph D, I think the more elastic form of number one, it gives to the countries the possibilities of having a large and well-organized or well-balanced commission. If paragraph D, too, would be selected, then having preferably a representative of the National Health Administration, I think in some other countries for some time ahead, we'll have the danger of having too many bureaucratic people. And in that case, I think if we adopt paragraph D, too, as our colleague from France is so keen in defending, I think we should have included in Chapter 5 the immediately, and not for the future, an advisory committee. This advisory committee would be well chosen, would sit permanently, would be composed of people of high standing in health matters that would be continuously thinking on devising new stunts or new solutions for the problems that may be presented, and would take out of the organization the possibility of being too bureaucratic or to become too much of an administrative organism, and not an organism that would further development in matters of public health. And I would like, on behalf of my delegation, to state that we are very much in favor of paragraph B, one in which we have three delegates, and if this conference adopts paragraph D, one, we may wait a little bit for the creation of this advisory committee, which I should like to see adopted immediately, anyhow. But if we adopt the paragraph D, too, I think it is absolutely necessary to come back and to make right away now, charter immediately, an advisory committee of a very high scientific and technical standing. Monsieur le Président, j'aurais quelques remarques à formuler sur les deux points qui viennent déjà d'être discutées. Au cours de nos discussions de Paris, nous avions déjà plus ou moins établi quelles étaient nos façons de voir en la matière, et je crois qu'il est bon d'observer que les paragraphes B et D ne sont pas les seuls à être liés avec les deux alternatives du paragraphe D, mais qu'également toute la section 5 est liée, si l'on regarde la question sous un angle très particulier, au paragraphe suivant du chapitre C. D'autre part, une note dans le même rapport à la page 145 précise que le Conseil devrait créer telle commission dont la conférence autoriserait l'établissement. Il devrait avoir le droit de créer de sa propre initiative ou sur la proposition du directeur général telles autres commissions qu'il jugerait souhaitables afin d'entrer dans la compétence de l'organisation. Nous avions approuvé cette solution à Paris et ma délégation est en faveur, formellement en faveur, du fait qu'il devrait y avoir trois délégués au lieu de un. Ceci permettrait en effet d'avoir au sein d'une délégation une personnalité technique qui pourrait exécuter toute décision administrative de l'Organisation internationale de la santé. Cela donnerait également la possibilité d'avoir une commission large et bien équilibrée. Dans le cas où ce serait la suggestion D2 qui serait adoptée, il est évident qu'à notre point de vue, nous courrions à un danger de créer une bureaucratie administrative. Je crois que si nous adoptons le paragraphe D2, comme notre collègue français l'a suggéré, il faudrait inclure au chapitre 5, et très formellement, qu'il y a urgence à constituer un comité de conseillers qui devrait commencer à rentrer en fonction immédiatement. Ce comité de conseillers devrait être formé de spécialistes, connaissant à fond les problèmes auxquels nous serons intéressés, qui seraient tout particulièrement chargés d'élaborer les solutions à apporter aux problèmes qui nous sont présentés. Je crois que ceci serait possible, et sans pour cela devenir organisme de fonctionnaires, l'adoption de telles clauses permettrait, je crois, le développement au plus haut degré possible dans tous les domaines concernant la santé publique. Ma délégation, ainsi donc, est très en faveur de l'adoption du paragraphe B1 tel qu'il est actuellement dans le projet que nous avons sous les yeux. Mais elle croit que si la conférence adopte le paragraphe D1 tel qu'il est, il serait bon, sans doute, d'après les termes de la clause et, suivant les explications données, d'attendre quelque peu pour la création de ce comité de conseillers que nous vous avons suggéré. Or, ici, nous préférerions la création immédiate de ce comité de conseillers. De toute façon, nous voulons souligner que si c'est la clause D2 qui est maintenue telle qu'elle est actuellement, il est nécessaire, à notre point de vue, de créer immédiatement ce comité de conseillers dont nous ne pourrions pas nous passer au point de vue scientifique et médical. Si je peux le dire un mot dans ma capacité de rapporteur de l'aise de la Société de la Côte d'Ai, de la Côte d'Ai, plutôt que de la Côte d'Ai, de la Côte d'Ai, je voudrais dire que la Société de la Côte d'Ai, de la Côte d'Ai en Paris, considérons cette point à une longue longue, qui reconnaissait l'aliment certain desirabilité de l'Ai, la Côte d'Ai, mais felt que it would be very difficult to describe just the form that should take at this time. They therefore incorporated on page 145 under committees, paragraph one, nine committees, paragraph one, it was felt gave complete power to the conference and the executive committee, the executive board rather, to set up technical advisory committees. There was, I think, complete agreement that that would happen. It was only that it was felt not expedient to prescribe the form it should take at this time until more experience was gained. May I invite anyone who, any member of the technical proprietary committee who does not quite agree with my interpretation to say so? I would like to give you a few examples on this particular point of view as reporter of the technical committee of Paris and not as president of the committee number 2. In fact, the technical committee preparatory of Paris has examined all along this particular measure. And it was indeed seemed to be souhaitable to put on the foot of a committee of a committee of a technical committee. But it also estimated that it was difficult to describe dès à présent what would be the organization and the function of this committee. And you will find out in the page 145 of the report, article nine, paragraph one. This article says in fact that the committee should create a committee of a committee, which would allow the establishment to be able to create a committee, etc. And, just like that, the mises on the foot of these organizations is certainly estimated to be souhaitable. But I think that in the current stage of the organization, it would not be good to describe the shape that would have these organizations, because it would be better to have the experience of this subject. I ask my colleagues who have done part of the technical committee preparatory of Paris to well want to indicate if they think that I have been wrong with the interpretation of what was decided within this technical committee preparatory. If no objection, the chair recognizes the delegate from Uruguay. Si aucune observation n'est attendue sur ce point particulier, je donne la parole à monsieur le délégué de l'Uruguay. The delegate from Chile. Monsieur le délégué de Chile. Monsieur le délégué de Chile. Monsieur le délégué de Chile. Monsieur le délство a la palabra 해� The variant of only design a delegado has its inconvenience. The Republic of Chile has experience this matter and I want to show you a few words. The protection of the health has been in my country, which has made a role in the laboratory of experience in two large branches. One that acts in the environment that surrounds the man, protecting his health in a indirect way. And the other, the action more direct about the individual, the family and the social media. So we have two basic aspects and fundamental aspects of great amplitude. The development of the public health and the health care and the public health care. And the action direct about the individual, the family and the social media. In one aspect, we fight against the infectious diseases and the great epidemics. And in another, we fight against the infectious diseases and endemic diseases, which is the tuberculosis. So, there is a specialization that is well defined, well precise and marked. The treatment of the environment that surrounds the man, the human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, and the human being, the human being, the human being and the total population. And in another, we fight against the population, through the examination of the system and periodicity. The medical system and periodicity. Chile has examined, as well as the total of the workers and employees, to research the diseases and the patients. For the patients, we have examined the disease. The human being, the human being, the human being, the human being, and the human being, the human being. And in this way, we have discovered a morbidity and ignoratory that we have only known through this direct action on the human being and the social social. And this aspect has a transcendence and importance as the that is the physical environment that is around the human being. In this way, we have to be able to represent the two large branches in which, at least in our small country, we have made this minuciosa experience so that the delegations can represent the ramas of specialization. This is, for the Chilean, a reason for the Chilean and the other, for the Chilean, a reason for the three delegations in which one is only. Respect to the Conseller and the Suplentes, I think the government should have the freedom to design all the Conseller and the Suplentes that they may be. And this is also the case. The following, I think the government should be in harmony with what I just said, in which the designation of the delegations should represent the technical nature of the function and the organization of the country. In this case, I think it would be a pleonastic to express that the delegations should be chosen between personalities very calificate because, as it is expressed in the primitive text, it is expressed in a more precise way, more precisely, more a fondo and more definable what should be the characteristics of the delegations. And since the moment in which each state member has a single vote, there is no obstacle to that three delegations that envies each country, to be able to represent better the better the specialization of the protection of the health. The delegations chilena should be reserved for that, in meetings of committee, to be able to explore more the fundamentals that it has for the observations formulated in this case. The delegation from Chile has just taken its place in this conference. Immediately, in relation with the proposals that have submitted to this assembly, I want to express, in the name of the Republic of Chile, that we wish to keep the first proposal that each member state should be represented by not more than three delegates. And we support this proposal of three delegates, and not one, because in Chile, among other nations, there has been a complete dissociation of public health work in two branches. One branch that takes care of sanitation in regards to the environment, and the other that takes care directly of the individual, the family, and the whole society. For this consideration, which has been used in Chile in such a way that now the services have examined practically every one of the workers in the country by medical examinations that have revealed to us a number of diseases in the beginning, meaning we think that we take care of the two aspects of public health work. The aspect that is general in regard to the environment, and that one, and that prevents particularly the acute problems of communicable diseases, and the other in regard to the individuals that take care of the problems of the chronic diseases, among them of tuberculosis. That's why we wish to have and support the proposal of three delegates, because we think that with this diversified way of looking at public health work, we need more persons to take care of each one of these different viewpoints. The C doesn't have absolutely any objection. Alternates and advisors may be permitted to accompany delegates. That's obvious. In regards to the letter D, we think that the delegates should be chosen among persons best qualified by their technical competence in the health field. And we think that this is also supported by our previous explanation about the way in which public health work has been used and is working in Chile. The last letter E, each member state should have one vote in the conference, doesn't need any discussion either. Chile is going to present afterwards in the smaller committees, its particular proposals in regard to each one of these different points. Mr. President, the delegation of Chile would express some remarks regarding these paragraphs that we have already discussed. The delegation chilies approuve the maintenance of the first proposal which is thus. Each member should be represented by three delegates in the plus, one of them being designated by the member as the delegation of the member. We support this proposal which is to create three members and not only one member. The main reason which follows, Le Chile, like some other countries, has divided its medical activities in two branches. The one of these branches is the one that treats the health care system in entirely and in general, and in general, the second is the one that is the individual's health care that is brought to the individual malady, or to the whole society or community. The result of this division of sanitary activities in two branches has now led to a result more satisfying. So, all the workers have been examined and we have been able to convey, in a very satisfying way, the contamination and the damage of the microbes. I believe that this is due to the fact that we have only envisioned the two aspects of the question. I would also say that I would support this proposition and we now have our point of view that we have three delegates, because, due to the division of work, we need to be specialists in each branch. The delegation chilies have no objection to paragraph C. Quant to paragraph D, we believe that the delegation should be chosen among the best qualified people according to their technical skills. This will allow us to achieve a much more satisfying rate. And this is explained by the arguments that we have already employed as to our way of considering the medical and sanitary questions in Chile. The delegation chilies is also in agreement with the content of paragraph E. However, in order to committees or commissions restreintes ulterior, the delegation chilies will allow us to present some other remarks that will be more detailed in detail on these same points. The chair recognizes the delegate from Denmark. The word is to Mr. Le Delegate of Denmark. As from eux,стarie опасdeni northe, flilogest of remain in interest if students come out from theDRien to Rome Elis, our excuse of the clerk's primary care Officer will be so proud of the Feeling Foundation for結構 since speech and the impress so milieğan. As french lehao ibiotsini is an excellent part of ammonia Sunday, the last film of George Music University has Brahmers. The voice of theimanal Yara for helping othersinhoág for a few more weapons upsellers and will be able to see victims ofinander thisinal as possible who feel in constant touch and feel constantly responsible as to this institution. And therefore, I think it's a very good idea to have at least three delegates which really, as I said before, feel constantly in touch with the same music. It may go so, and it often goes so, that one man loses its interest. But as long as there are three, there's a hope that at least one will keep, so to say, constant burning. That's why I think it's a good idea to have three delegates. I don't have much, of course, to add to the matter, Mr. President, after all the observations that have been presented to us. I would also be very clear. I think it is very significant that we can be so many reunions in this Assemblée, representing countries so different and so different. And it's this desire of cooperation that must guide us in our work. I think it's also very happy that we here, we feel completely the responsibility that will be in the action that we decided to take into. I think, however, I will only mark my approval to the first clause contained in the paragraph B, in stating that I consider the idea excellent to have three delegates, mainly because it allows us to keep contact in the different branches of medical activity. I think it would also be good to notice that if one of the only delegates could be disinterested a little bit or for a determined period of questions of treated, it is less probable that all of the three would be disinterested. The Chair recognizes the Delegate from Lebanon. I agree with the Delegate from the United States that it is very desirable to give the possibility I agree with the delegate from the United States that it is very desirable to give the possibility to any member state to send as many as three delegates for the reasons given but of course it is understood that any state may send only one delegate if it so wishes I think many small nations will find it very difficult and expensive to send more than one delegate it is for this reason that I believe that we should not insist that where one delegate only is sent he should be representing the National Health Administration of the member state in many of the small nations I think there is a higher degree of technical competence outside the national services of the state that is why I believe from the point of view of the small nations it is better to adopt the first alternative under these and to give the member states the freedom to send as their delegate as their only delegate a person who is most competent but who may be not connected with the national services of the state a university professor may have greater competence than a member of the National Health Service there is one other difficulty with the second alternative under D and that is it says the delegate now the delegate should be chosen from among persons now if we adopt the first alternative under B then some explanation is necessary in the drafting is he to be the chief delegate and if we mean here the chief delegate should be preferably a representative of the National Health Administration then I don't see that that is necessary at all the chief delegate may be a person of high technical qualifications who is not a member of the health administration having with him other delegates or one other delegate from the National Health Administration so I support the first alternative under D especially from the point of view of the small nations who will have difficulty in sending more than one delegate Monsieur le délégué du Liban je suis entièrement d'accord avec le délégué des Etats-Unis lorsque celui-ci a estimé qu'il était souhaitable d'envoyer qu'il soit permis à chaque état d'envoyer trois délégués et ceci pour les raisons que Monsieur le délégué des Etats-Unis a bien voulu donner mais il me semble qu'il est naturel et qu'il va sans dire que tout pays aura le droit de n'envoyer qu'un seul délégué en effet pour de petits pays il sera peut-être difficile d'envoyer plus d'un délégué et pour ces raisons également je crois qu'il n'est pas utile d'insister plus longuement sur le point que dans le cas où un seul délégué sera envoyé celui-ci devra obligatoirement être un représentant de l'administration nationale de la santé publique en effet et dans le cas de beaucoup de petits pays il y aura des gens qui auront une compétence technique très large et qui seront en dehors de l'administration pour de quoi ce soit présent tant les pouvoirs politiques qui appliquent les choses de la santé et le bien-être humain comme les savoirs médicaux qui inspirent l'œuvre alors cette assemblée ferait l'élection de les conseils techniques entre les membres ou entre les techniques qualifiés mais pour que la consagration se soit faite chaque élu doit réservoir la ratification de son gouvernement alors il y a une assemblée générale de tous les pouvoirs politiques et médicaux et il y a aussi un conseil technique qui est pour ainsi dire au lieu de le conseil executif il n'y a pas d'exécution sur le point international parce que chaque exécution ça implique en intromission en tasse de conflits quelquefois difficile alors alors un espace de conseil technique avec les directeurs nommés d'une façon souveraine pour ainsi dire pour l'assemblée et après ça les secrétariats ce sont des affaires de l'assemblée et sur l'affaire des les organes regionales ça serait matière d'une addition ulterior merci bien monsieur I would like to express myself in favor of the proposals made here by the delegate of the South Africa I also think that the wording should be changed that we should change the name of our organs the World Health Organization is going to have I think it's important to reinforce the authority of those organs and therefore I would suggest that we call our highest organ not conference but coordination coordinating assembly or assembly of coordination and this coordinating assembly will appoint the other higher organs of the World Health Organizations which will be the Technical Council the Secretary General and the Secretariat I think and it's very important to have the additional organs the regional agencies incorporated in the World Health Organization I think it has been suggested by many delegations that there should be represented in our conferences representatives of political authorities together with representatives of medical authorities thus this assembly this coordinating assembly consisting of political and medical authorities will appoint the technical council it is important that each member of this technical council should be his election should be ratified by the appropriate government this will take care of the problem that the assembly the international organ will have a technical council as an executive organ which will have to imply the decisions of the assembly through the governments of the appropriate countries and therefore the ratification of the members of the technical council by the appropriate countries is of such importance in other words we will have this structure of our organs the coordinating assembly the technical council the director general and the original organs the original agencies incorporated in the World Health Organization Chair recognizes the delegate from the United Kingdom the верх the goog the représentant members that A should read the conference, should be composed of delegates representing member states. That's a small point. Representing member states. Representing instead of the word for. I've been a little worried about this discussion on the number of delegates, whether there should be three or only one. I think it's a pity that we've got to discuss the composition of a body before we've even discussed what that body's got to do. And if you turn the page and look at the functions of the body, you'll see that the word conference, as my friend the delegate from South Africa pointed out, isn't really a good name for a body that has got to do the technical, difficult work that this conference is going to have to do. So that it's quite important, in my judgment, that we should get together a body that's a real business body. Everybody wants the same thing in this conference. Everybody wants to get the most suitable body we can for doing the important business of the World Health Organization. And everybody wants it to have the very best possible advice. And the whole problem now is, how are we going to get there? Now, if there are going to be 60 or 70 nations represented on this World Health Organization, and very large numbers of them are going to send three, and each of these three is going to have the right to get up and talk when he feels like it. And if indeed within a delegation from a single nation, you're going to get different views expressed by the individual delegates, you know you'll never know what that particular country is thinking about the problem under discussion. And it seems to me that it's highly important when business comes up before the conference that it should already have been discussed in individual countries, that they should make their national contribution to the discussion, and therefore that there should be one member who speaks for that country. He can be accompanied, obviously, by alternates, because nobody can stand day after day of this kind of conference without breaking down at some time or another. And he will also have with him all the advisors that are necessary. And furthermore, the organization is being provided with committees upon which not merely delegates will sit, but vast numbers of people invited from outside on account of their technical competence. So what we have to give our attention to, it seems to me, this afternoon, is what is the best kind of business body for dealing with the work of this so-called conference. And I cannot help thinking that it's one official delegate from every country with the necessary alternates and advisors. And therefore, I can't help feeling, and I had no preconceived ideas about this before I came here, I can't help feeling that really alternative two is the better one. This conference won't really, of course, be discussing matters, I mean the new conference, won't be discussing matters in the same way that this conference is discussing them. We've got a great many broad issues to look at, and it's highly important that the widest possible discussion from the greatest number of delegates should be obtained. But that won't be so with the new conference of the World Health Organization. It's going to be much more of a business body. And that brings me rather to the second point. What kind of person should in fact be the delegate? Now, I'm in the fortunate or unfortunate position of having not been a bureaucrat all my life. I saw my old and good friend, the delegate from Brazil, rather looking at me when he talked about bureaucrats. But I, in fact, have only been a bureaucrat for quite a short period of time. Before that, I was a university professor, and I've been used in both capacities by the government of the United Kingdom to represent them. Now, all I can say is this, that as a university professor and in charge of a quite large postgraduate school in London, my influence with the government was really not worth very much at all. But as the chief medical officer of the Ministry of Health in Britain, they have to listen to me. And it's much more likely that if a person like myself attended this conference and went back to the government of the United Kingdom and said, now, these are the proposals of this conference, and I recommend you to adopt them, it's much more likely that the government would listen to me very sympathetically, indeed much more sympathetically, than they would have listened to me in the old days before I actually had a position in the government service. So that I know quite well that every country, of course, cannot, every country's health service is not as good as every other country's. And sometimes, as has been pointed out, the non-governmental medical people are very much better than the governmental. But I think one of the main objects of this health organization will be to endeavor to help countries to build up their national health services. And we ought to do everything from the very earliest stage to support that. And therefore, I can't help feeling that it would be wise to include some sort of reference, as indeed there is in D, alternative 2, some sort of reference to the advisability, where practicable, of having the official delegate, somebody who has a definite and official position in the government service. Well, sir, these are observations that have occurred to me while I've been listening to the discussion. And I can't help feeling that so far as we are concerned in the UK delegation, we, unlike most other people, I think, would prefer alternative 2 under D and alternative 2 under D. Monsieur, je vais first I am sorry to say that we are representing governments and not the governments of governments. I was a little troubled about the discussion that just came to be here. It seems that we put the chariot in front of the bus and try to determine the composition of an organism before we even ask them to be asked about the functions of this organism. If you go to a few pages further and examine the section which is consacred to functions, you will be sure that the word conference is perhaps not the most happy term for determining the character of the organization that we are going to create. We want to, in the questions that we are concerned, to entour the best and best views. What we need to know now is how we will provide these advice, how these advice will be available to an organism which should be, at the end, an organism of work. Well, if I examine a little what will happen, I will see that there will be 60 or 80 delegations that if we choose the alternative which allows to nominate 3 délégués, we multiply this number by 3 and we will be very very very in the situation where all the délégués will be able to take the parole on a subject given, where they could easily be able to do that, that they could easily be able to express their opinions particular, and they would arrive to be in agreement with the same delegation, which, obviously, will not contribute to clear the problem. I believe that in the questions that we are preoccupied today, it would be indispensable that the countries have heard auparavant that they have formed their own own policies and that, in the conference, at this occasion, they will express an opinion concerted, an opinion unique that represents the political position of the country in question. I add that there will be commissions, that at this commission, that other personnalities will be invited, that, in this case, the number of people participating in these meetings will be even more considerable. I will let you think at that degree of logomachie we can be able to go on the peril of all. It is to realize that what we will be able to do after this first conference, where, of course, all the ideas should largely be expressed before the principles are determined, which is not exactly what will be the normal work of the other assembly, of the other conference for employés and terminology employés until now. That is, before all, a organism of work in which a discipline of thought and action will be necessary. And I do not believe that we can adopt another solution that is, which is to reduce the number of the duties to one single duty official, which, of course, which, of course, may have a support and a technical support and a technical support in nombre of the members. It is impossible for a man to participate actively to all the meetings of an assembly like this, but that they can be represented in the agreement, but that his voice in the Conseil is to be able to and comport the affirmation of the opinion of the country that is represented. And that, of course, it is to be able to ask how this delegation will be composed. I saw a few of my honourable ami, the délégué of the Brésil who looked at me and who, in pronouncing the word bureaucratic, seemed to make an allusion direct to my personality. I would have noticed that I was a bureaucratic in the somme that for a few years of my life that I was a long time professor of university and the titular of a chair important to London. And I was employed by my government both in my quality of professor of university and in my quality of the Ministry of Health and Public Health. I must say that, even though my importance from the scientific point of view is not varied, I had as a professor of university infinitely less influence in my government than as a secretary of the Ministry of Health. We could listen when I was a professor, but we must listen to me. The government is prepared to recommend sufficient changes in our present temporary rules in order to enable the election of additional offices of the conference at this time. Translation. Nous avons par conséquent, comme deuxième point, et qui était le dernier point qui était prévu pour notre réunion de cet après-midi, à procéder à l'élection des membres du bureau restant encore à élire. Mais pour ceci, il est nécessaire d'apporter quelques changements aux règlements intérieurs provisoires que nous avions adaptés au cours de notre réunion d'hier après-midi. Et en particulier, il serait nécessaire de prévoir quelques nouvelles règles modifiées qui auraient trait à cette élection des membres du bureau. Il a été indiqué que le président du comité sur le règlement intérieur, le Dr Cavaillon, était prêt à vous présenter quelques recommandations en ce qui concerne ce changement de quelques points particuliers du règlement intérieur en ce qui concerne l'élection des membres du bureau. Et ceci vous permettrait de procéder à cette élection. La parole est au Dr Cavaillon. La parole est au Dr Cavaillon. Monsieur Monroge, par suite de l'incident que vient de vous exposer notre président, il est important de vous à vous présenter la parole à la présidente de la présidente. La parole est au Dr Cavaillon. Monsieur Monroge, par suite de l'incident que vient de vous exposer notre président, se limite à fort peu de choses. En effet, si pas mal de modifications ont été apportées par la sous-commission hier sur l'ensemble du projet de règlement intérieur, c'est seulement aujourd'hui sur deux articles que j'ai à vous exposer les propositions de la sous-commission. Il s'agit tout d'abord dans le document EH3 que vous avez sous les yeux l'article 26 et l'article 29. L'article 26 était ainsi conçu pour assurer une répartition équitable et rationnelle des fonctions électives au sein de la conférence. Celle-ci élit en séance plénière son propre président et ses quatre vice-présidents ainsi que le président et les trois vice-présidents de chacune de ces commissions. Votre sous-commission a estimé qu'il aurait intérêt à modifier légèrement le texte de cet article. Tout d'abord, que l'on pouvait supprimer la phrase idéologique tentant à dire qu'il faut assurer une répartition équitable et rationnelle des fonctions électives au sein de la conférence. Cela va de soi. Deuxièmement, elle a estimé qu'il était préférable qu'il y ait 5 vice-présidents plutôt que 4. Et d'autre part, elle a pensé que ce n'était pas à la commission plénière d'élire les vice-présidents des sous-commissions, mais que véritablement chaque commission de travail pouvait élire ses vice-présidents et plus exactement son vice-président, car elle a pensé qu'il suffisait qu'il y ait, par contre, un seul vice-président pour chaque sous-commission. Et enfin, elle a estimé également qu'il était utile que chaque commission de travail puisse élire aussi son rapporteur. Dans ces conditions, le texte de l'article 26 deviendrait le suivant. La conférence est lit en séance plénière son propre président, 5 vice-présidents, ainsi que le président de chacune de ces commissions de travail. Chaque commission peut élire son propre vice-président et son rapporteur. Voici pour l'article 26. En ce qui concerne l'article 29, l'article 29 était ainsi conçu. Les présidents, vice-présidents de la conférence et les présidents de ces commissions constituent une commission générale chargée d'orienter les débats de la conférence et de coordonner les travaux de ces commissions spécialistes. Votre sous-commission vous propose une modification assez importante. Elle vous propose que la commission générale comprenne, outre les présidents, vice-présidents de la conférence et les présidents des commissions, trois délégués désignés par la conférence de façon à élargir légèrement la commission générale et ne pas en faire uniquement un comité de direction trop restreint. Dans ces conditions, le texte de l'article 29 deviendrait le suivant. Les présidents, vice-présidents de la conférence et les présidents de ces commissions, ainsi que trois délégués désignés par la conférence constituent une commission générale chargée d'orienter les débats de la conférence et de coordonner les travaux de ces commissions. Voici, messieurs, exactement la mission que j'étais chargé de remplir auprès de vous au nom de la commission que j'ai eu l'honneur de présider hier après-midi. Merci. Merci. As a result of the accident about which our president told you a minute ago, I can only bring to your attention a few things. There were many modifications made in the general rules of procedure, but today I would like to bring to your attention only two decisions of this commission. They refer to the document EH3, and it refers to the rules 26 and 29. The rule 26, the old text read, to ensure and adjust and rational distribution of the elective functions of the conference. The latter shall elect at the plenary meeting its own president and four vice presidents as well as the chairman and three vice-chairmen of each of its committees. The subcommittee in charge of the rules of procedure told that it is not for the plenary meeting to elect the vice-president, vice-chairmen of the committees. That each committee could elect her own vice-presidents, and not three but only one. Also, it's up to the committees to elect their own rapporteurs. It has also been found that there is no need to have mention of the motives of these elections, and therefore it has been suggested to delete the sentence to ensure a just and rational distribution, and so on and so on. As a result of these changes, pardon me, it has been also decided that we should have five vice-presidents, and therefore as a result of these changes, the final text is now that the conference shall elect at the plenary meeting its own president, five vice-presidents, as well as the chairman of each of its committees. With regard to Rule 29, it has been added the old text which read the presidents and vice-presidents of the conference and the chairman of the committee shall constitute a general committee, entrusted with directing the debate of the conference and coordinating the work of specialized committees. It has been decided to add, as well as three delegates designated by the conference. So the final text is now the presidents and vice-presidents of the conference, the chairman of the committees, as well as three delegates designated by the conference shall constitute the general committee, entrusted with directing the debate of the conference, and so on. These are exactly the few remarks I wanted to make to you. in the name of the subcommittee, entrusted with drafting the rules of procedure. Mr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President, Mr. President, I am going to thank you for your attention to the fact that the texts that I asked for you to discuss and adopt are, in fact, already distributed under your hands, in a way, almost identical to the way they have been presented in the document EH-4, that is, the projects presented by the American delegation. In order to have the text on your eyes, there is only one or two words to be modified compared to the text presented by the American delegation. You have heard the report and motion by Dr. Cavaillon that the rules of procedure be revised as he has recommended. Is that motion supported? You have heard the report presented by Dr. Cavaillon and the motion proposed by him in order to read the two rules of the text presented by him. Does anyone support this motion? The motion is supported by the delegate from Holland, the Dominican Republic and others. Are you ready to vote? Those in favour, please indicate by saying aye. Opposed by the usual sign. A view contrary. It is unanimously voted. Adopté à l'unanimité. The next order of business is the election of the five vice-presidents provided for, and then the election of the section chairman, and the additional members at large to the general committee. The next order of the day is the election of the five vice-presidents who are prevailing. Then we will proceed to the election of the section president and also to the three members of the delegation who have been prevailing. The chair recognizes the delegate from South Africa. La parole est à monsieur le délégué de l'Afrique du Sud. Mr. President, Mr. President and delegates, it gives me great pleasure and honor to propose that the senior delegates from China, France, the USSR, United Kingdom and Brazil be elected as our vice-chairmen. Mr. President, I would like to propose that the president of the conference's chair of the Chinese, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and Brazil be elected as the vice-president of the conference. Is this nomination supported? The delegate from India. The delegate from Holland, the delegate from Czechoslovakia, the delegate from Cuba, the delegate from Egypt, the delegate from Ecuador, the delegate from Nicaragua. The motion is widely supported. Is there a discussion? The motion is supported. The discussion is supported. If not, is there objection? If not, is there objection? There is no objection. There is no objection. And the delegates who have been nominated are unanimously elected as vice-presidents of this conference. The next order of business is the election of the committee chairman. The chair recognizes Dr. Chen of China. The point of the order of the day is the election of the president of the committee. The president, the president, the president, the president, the president of China. The president, the president, the president of the president of China, the president of China, the president. Hello, delegates. First of all, I would say a word of appreciation. And I feel that I've been greatly honored to be elected to, to be elected a vice-chairman of the conference. conference. And I feel that by electing the chairman of the Chinese delegation to the one of the vice-presidents, you are rendering great honor not only to the individual, but also to China and to the people of the Far East. And in that belief, I venture to accept with a sense of humility and also a knowledge of added responsibility. Now in the name of the Chinese delegation, I have the honor to nominate for the chairman of the working committee, as well as the three additional members of the general committee, as follows.
