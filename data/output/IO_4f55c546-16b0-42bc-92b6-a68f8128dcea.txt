There's no business like no business like no business I know. Everything about it is appealing. Everything the traffic will allow. So where could you have that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow? We bring you now on stage. Music and drama dedicated to the 31st annual appeal of New York Catholic Charities and starring Mary Martin, Ray Bolger, and Walter Hampton in highlights from their current Broadway hits. Your host and guide during this transcribed tour of New York's theatrical district is that popular producer and actor of the legitimate stage, Mr. Eddie Dowling. Mr. Dowling. Thank you. It's a great pleasure to present these great stars performing for a great cause. The annual fund appeal of New York Catholic Charities. You know, many people don't feel the real parts of New York beating for its little people. Don't know what New York Catholic Charities does for homeless children and old folks, the sick and destitute. Don't realize that all of you do care about your needy neighbors. And among you, I include those warm-hearted, brilliant stars of show business who give their time and talent that others may look with hope to the future. So I started out to talk over with some of the stars what sort of show we might put on for Catholic Charities. The first person I thought of was Ray Bolger. Ray had done such a swell job for us during the war while I was president of the USO camp shows. I made an appointment to meet him at the St. James Theater where he's packing them in in that great musical comedy hit, Where's Charlie? Hello, Eddie. How are you? What's this all about? Well, Ray, New York Catholic Charities are running their annual appeal show now, and I'm trying to put together a show business radio program for them. Would you be willing to join up for it? Naturally. I mean, I'm indebted to the Catholic Charities for more reasons than one. Number one, I think it's more than a charity. It's a work of love. And secondly, I have been recipient in my youth of some charity from the Catholic Charities many years ago when my father was sick, had double pneumonia, and my mother was ill, had no money in the house. Along came Christmas time and a big basket of food. Oh, my. A turkey in Boston, you know. Oh. People don't always have fun. Dear old Boston. Dear old turkey on Christmas time. Believe me, it was wonderful. Your show was such a smash hit. Say, the audience certainly was with you the night I saw it, Ray. Well, that's a thrill, because we have the most wonderful audience in the world. It's a great privilege to play, especially to that very discriminating youth. It's the most exciting thing on Saturday afternoon, to have them whistle and cheer, and to know that you've got a show that's clean and pleasant and amusing. And also for the grown-ups, Eddie, we don't have any atom bombs and no spies and no political connotations. And while the cast doesn't even wear modern clothes, it's to take you out of the world that we're living in today. One of the things that thrilled me when I saw you the other afternoon was the community sing. Oh, you mean Once in Love with Amy? Yeah. All those kids. You know, we started with a kid. On the first matinee that we played, one little kid, well, I was singing, Once in Love with Amy. He said, No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He did? And I said, Well, if you want to sing, we'll join right in, and I gave him the lyrics. You know, the only other time that I ever recall hearing anything like that in a hit show was back in the 20s when Raymond Hitchcock was starring in one of his Hitchy Coo shows. He used to have the audience sing. Old-fashioned guy. Old-fashioned guy. That's right. Oh, sure. Every performance. Uh-huh. Well, he was a wonderful man, Hitchcock. Well, you know that you're not unlike him, right? There was a cute little number in Hitchy Coo by the name of Ray Dooley. Oh, me too. Whatever happened to her? Well, I know that you're just trying to get a gag in here. She's still a cute number. She changed her name from Dooley to Dowling a good many years ago. One of the things that's been a great thrill to me and very heartwarming is your wife. When we were first married, Gwen had a wonderful opportunity. She came here for Ziegfeld and could have gone on far in the theater, but she decided to give up her theatrical career and chose mine as her career. She's responsible for my first big break, and she's co-producer of Where's Charlie. She's a remarkable person. Which one of the shows was it, Ray, that you did that sensational dance, Slaughter on 10th Avenue? On Your Toes. That was back in 1936. Mm-hmm. On Your Toes was the first ballet that was done, integrated ballet in the show. And it was a very exciting thing for me to do because it was the first show that I'd ever got any real notice in as an individual. The Slaughter on 10th Avenue was a ballet that ran 15 minutes and came at the end of the show. The opening night that I was told that the audience cheered the ballet, but I had passed out. Let's not talk about me anymore, but let's talk about the Catholic Charities. I'd like that very much. My heart is very much in it, Ray. Well, you know, I read something in the newspaper today and said that the Catholic Charity is not a charity, as a charity, but a work of love. Say, now, Ray and Amy make a big hit on the Catholic Charity show. I think what we ought to do is to play Once in Love with Amy and let the audience hear it and then insist upon them giving something to the Catholic Charities. I can say insist in the sense that it's only an appeal, but I insist upon appealing. I caught you, sir, having a look at her As she went strolling by Now didn't your heart go Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom Now didn't you sigh I warn you, sir Never to dream of her Just bid such thoughts be gone Or it'll be boom, boom Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom From then on For once in love with Amy Always in love with Amy Ever and ever Fascinated by her Set your heart a fire To stay Once you're kissed by Amy Tear up your list It's Amy Ply her with bonbons Poetry and flowers Moon a million hours away You might be quite the fickle-hearted rover So carefree and bold Who loves a girl and later thinks it over Then just quit the code I was once in love with Amy Always in love with Amy Ever and ever Sweetly you'll romance her Trouble is the answer will be That Amy'd rather stay in love with me Ever and ever Fascinated by her Oh I'm so happy I want everybody to sing with me The next line Once you're kissed by Amy Once you're kissed by Amy Tear up your list It's Amy Tear up your list It's Amy Ply her with bonbons Poetry and flowers Ply her with bonbons Poetry and flowers Moon a million hours away Moon a million hours away Let me say you You might be quite the fickle-hearted rover So carefree and bold Who loves a girl and later thinks it over Then just quit the code Everybody sing once in love with Amy Once in love with Amy Always in love with Amy Always in love with Amy Ever and ever Sweetly you'll romance her Ever and ever Sweetly you'll romance her Trouble is the answer will be Trouble is the answer will be Ha ha ha ha That Amy'd rather stay in love With me Ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha greatest we all the time has heard of me o'clock at that time has heard of us in love with Amy I'm sure that there isn't anybody that's heard of us today who has anything to spare that won't give any Catholic Charities because Catholic means everything right here. Yeah, means all. It means all. Means all and it's for everybody, everybody in need. And gosh, it's wonderful to have you here today. Well, thanks for coming over, Eddie. I walked over to the Golden Theatre where Walter Hamden and Grace George are co-starring in The Velvet Glove. It was just after the Saturday Man in a performance and I went right into Mr. Hamden's dressing room just off the stage and there was the grand old man of the theatre with all of his richness of spirit, vitality and artistry and that indefinable quality that makes the star and keeps him on top through generations of theatre-goers. He was chatting with Naomi Riordan, the very talented young actress who plays the role of Sister Lucy in the play. Hello, Eddie. It's good to see you. Do you know Naomi Riordan? We haven't met, Walter, but of course I've seen your performance, Miss Riordan and it's a very good one, by the way. You should be very proud of it. Why, thank you, Mr. Dowling. This is a real thrill for me. I've looked forward to meeting you for a long time. Now, sit down, Eddie. You don't need an excuse to come to see me, you know, but I'm sure you have one, a good one, as usual, too. It's about New York Catholic Charities of Peelwater. I thought perhaps you'd be interested in doing a scene from the Velvet Glove for one of their radio shows. Why, I'd be glad to, Eddie. Of course, I'm familiar with the wonderful job the Catholic Charities does in New York, particularly their work with families and for the aged. So you don't have to sell me on the worthiness of the cause. I know that, Walter. We all remember so well the beautiful performance that you gave some years ago impersonating the late Cardinal Hayes in one of Catholic Charities' radio dramatic shows. Now, come to think of it, Walter, I suppose you've probably created or recreated the lives of more Cardinals than any other actor in the theatre. Well, perhaps that's so, Eddie. Now, let me see. As you mentioned, I played Cardinal Hayes, and then the great Woolsey in Henry VIII, and, of course, one of my favourite roles, Cardinal Richelieu. Nobody could forget that, Walter. And I doubt if anyone is going to have the courage to play Richelieu for a long time to come. You've created such an exciting and perceptive characterization of one of the really great figures in the history of the church. Do you think you might bring it back? Well, hardly, Eddie. I'm a little too old for management, you know. And anyway, I'm always interested in the new thing. You know, Walter, I've never had the chance to tell you this, but I welcome the opportunity now. Now, you're responsible for one of the most cherished experiences that I've ever had in the theatre. The memory of what I think was a performance unmatched in theatrical history in our time, certainly, your Cyrano de Bergerac. Is it your favourite among your many plays? Well, Eddie, whatever role I'm playing at the time, I guess it's my favourite. And as for Cyrano, I guess the answer is that everybody likes Cyrano. There's no doubt about that. It certainly has stood up well, hasn't it, all through the years? You're about to celebrate your golden anniversary, as an actor, I understand. Have you any idea of the number of performances you've given in that time? It sounds like an awful long time, doesn't it? Golden anniversary. Well, I suppose I might say, to make it a round dozen, 12,000. My, that's quite a record, Walter. Incidentally, you're one of those rarities here. Aren't you a native New Yorker, I mean? Now, Eddie, can any good thing come out of Brooklyn? That's where I come from. Well, I lived there, too, as a kid. There's something I'm particularly interested in. Do you find any difference between present-day audiences and, well, say, the reactions of theatre-goers 20 years ago? Well, that's a very difficult question, Eddie. I think that there is a difference, which is due largely, perhaps, to a change in method and to a change in style of the play. Perhaps, in the earlier times, we were more interested in the cruder and more violent emotions and that the actors tended to portray those fundamentals with a little more strength and perhaps arouse the audience, in consequence, more than they do today. And now, with the easier, more modern, naturalistic style and a more intellectual, perhaps, stress in the theatre and the content of the plays, they become more studies and so on, why the audience respond, but they respond in accordance with the method of the actor and the style of the play. I think you did that very well. It was a question I wouldn't have known about. That rings us back, Walter, the velvet glove. You play a monsignor in this one, don't you? How does it feel to be demoted? Well, now, that's a joke around here that's been about for a long time. You're about the 50th person to ask me that, Eddie. Now, let me be serious about it. For as I see it, cardinals, bishops, monsignori, they're all priests. There's no demotion possible. For instance, have you ever known any part in a stage play comparable to the role played in real life by such a figure as Father Damien? Who gave up everything to serve the lepers of Molokai? Father Damien was a mere priest. Yet he became a symbol of the selfless love of God for his children. No demotion there, Eddie? No, indeed. And I see your point quite well, Walter. And that's really why we do, we do appreciate your help for the small army of devoted religious sisters and brothers who do the work of Catholic charities here, year in and year out. From dawn, Walter, all through the day and long through the night. And that's why it's a pleasure to help out, Eddie. You know, Grace George, who gives such a superb performance as the Mother Superior in our play, was very anxious to participate in this with us. But she felt that none of our scenes together could be done well as a separate unit apart from the play. So, with her usual graciousness, she suggested that Miss Riordan and I do one of our scenes together. Suppose we run through it right now. Will you set the stage, Eddie? We are privileged to present a scene from Gossary McClintock's current production, The Velvet Glove, which co-stars Miss Grace George and Mr. Walter Hamden. In the dramatic scene which follows, Mr. Hamden as Monsignor Burke comes to call on the Mother Superior and meets the young nun, Sister Lucy, who is played by Miss Naomi Ryle. Well, Sister, this will give me a chance to question you about the state of the nation. Oh, well, I'm afraid I know very little about the nation, Monsignor. What? You're not interested in politics? Well, I have so little time to think of them, Monsignor. My duties keep me very busy. And at recreation, Mother likes us to occupy ourselves with serious things. The government of the nation is a very serious thing, Sister. Oh, yes, Monsignor, we know that. Indeed, we offer special prayers every day for the men who bear the burden of public office. They could do with a few prayers. When just before election time each year, the entire community makes a special novena. For what candidate, Sister? We leave that to God. Oh, that's a happy thought. It was an idea of Mother's. A gentleman who was a great benefactor of our order told Mother one day, it was just before presidential election, that the country was in a most precarious condition and could hardly survive unless the candidate whom he was supporting was elected. And he asked Mother to urge all the sisters of the community to vote for that candidate. Did she? No, she did something even better. She commanded them to make a novena to the Holy Ghost to ask for guidance and then to vote as they pleased. And how do you vote, Sister? Well, at the end of the novena, oh, we begin it on the Feast of the Great St. Teresa. I always go to one of the sisters at the college and she's good enough to prepare a list for me. Then we must hope that she's been guided by the Holy Ghost. Well, it can hardly be doubted, Monsignor. She's very pious. Well, I'm afraid this evidence that the Holy Ghost does not invariably decide elections. Really, Monsignor? Oh, but we can't be sure of it, can we? God's ways are so mysterious. Oh, you've noticed that, have you? Even in my own life. When I was young, I had an ambition. I wanted to be a Carmelite. Did you indeed? Oh, I thought I should die of unhappiness if I weren't allowed to enter that order. And I prayed very fervently that I would be accepted. But Father O'Neill... Oh, you know old Father O'Neill, don't you? I think of him as young Father O'Neill, but I know him. Well, he was our pastor at the time. And he told me that he thought I should become a sister of St. Paul to help the sisters who are educating our Catholic young women. Well, he was such a holy man that I knew I ought to obey him. So I entered the novitiate here thinking, if you please, that I was making the greatest sacrifice that had ever been made. Oh, and you see how it's turned out. I haven't had an unhappy moment since I crossed the threshold of the convent. I'm sure you haven't. It sometimes worries me. That you're happy? Yes. We're told that we must take up our cross and follow him. And I've never had a cross. But perhaps I will. Don't count on it, sister. It occasionally pleases God to show the world what felicity innocence can produce. It may be that he has chosen you for that purpose. Oh. In any case, you must accept your happiness as his will and try not to murmur against him. Oh, I don't do that, Monsignor. That is a relief, sister. Thank you. There are four words that automatically come to mind when you think about stars and hits. Mary Martin and South Pacific. Well, I called Mary, told her about the Catholic Charity Show and arranged to meet her in her dressing room at the Majestic Theater just after the performance. Come in, Eddie. Excuse me if I seem a little breathless. Mary, don't you ever slow down, although you certainly look as though all this agrees with you. Well, Nellie Forbush is such a natural part to play. I sometimes wonder where Mary Martin begins and Nurse Forbush leaves off. Well, Mary, for a little girl from Little Rock, Nellie certainly is made good in the big city. The audience sure love her. Actually, Eddie, I think it's a matter of identification. There were thousands of girls like Nellie who were sort of thrust into the big wide world for the first time during the war. Nellie is a pretty typical type of all of them. She was a small-town girl, wholly unprepared for the tremendous variety of people and places she experienced during the war. This role is pretty different from the ones you've played to date, isn't it, Mary? Do you find the change of pace difficult? Well, I suppose, like any actress or actor, as you very well know, your favorite part is the one you're playing currently. That's really true, and true of all of us. You know, Walter Hamden said almost exactly the same thing. Of course, I'll always remember Leave It to Me with great affection because that was my first step up. Indeed. My heart belongs to Daddy. We were all certainly singing at that season, but let's get back to South Pacific, and I suppose everyone asks you, Mary, how did that wonderful piece of business develop, the part where you wash your hair right on stage? Well, that was one of those funny turnabout things, Eddie. One day, it occurred to me that it would be a perfectly natural thing for Nellie to do, so I suggested it. Everyone liked the idea, and that made Oscar Hammerstein think of a lyric called I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair and Dick the Wonderful Music, and there we were. That's the wonderful thing about show business. You never know where your hits are coming from or how they'll develop. About the Catholic charity show, Mary, I think that that would make a perfect spot for it. I have a record here, Eddie. Let's play it and see how it is for time. Well, I'm gonna wash that man right and send him on his way. I'm gonna wave that man right out of my arms. I'm gonna wave that man right out of my arms. I'm gonna wave that man right out of my arms and send him on his way. Don't try to patch it up. Tear it up. Tear it up. Wash him out. Dry him out. Push him out. Fly him out. And so him and let him go. Yay, sister! I'm gonna wash that man right out of my hair. I'm gonna wash that man right out of my hair. I'm gonna wash that man right out of my hair and send him on his way. If a man don't understand you, if you fly on separate beams, waste no time, make a change. Ride that man right off your range. Drop him out of the rollercoast and drum him out of your dreams. Oh, oh! If you launch that different comic, if you root for different teams, waste no time, sweet no more, show him what the story's for. Drop him out of the rollercoast and drum him out of your dreams. You can't light a fire when the wood's all wet. No! You can't make a butterfly strong. Ha, ha! You can't fix an egg when it ain't quite good. And you can't fix a man when he's raw. You can't put back a petal when it falls from a flower. Or sweeten up a fella when he starts turning sour. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! I went and washed that man right out of my hair I went and washed that man right out of my hair I sent him on his way. Mary, that's wonderful. Everyone at Catholic Charities will be thrilled that you can be counted in on this. Eddie, it's a real pleasure to do what I can for Catholic Charities. Just the other day, I read a report showing they helped more than 400,000 men, women, and children last year. And as a mother, I'm particularly interested in what they do to help youngsters, those who are sick or handicapped or orphans. It's something we should all love to join in, and I'm happy to ask everyone to support their appeal generously. Thanks, Mary, and God bless you. When I reached the street after leaving, Mary, the neon lights were flashing their gaudy colors against New York's night sky. I felt the pulse of the big town, and I felt the pulse of the people beating along with it, with a real understanding of the other fellow's needs and problems. I thought over what Mary, Ray, and Walter had said about New York Catholic Charities, and I wondered how we'd go about getting the show together. Suddenly, I stopped short. I realized the show was right there, just as it happened. And so, that's just what you heard. We hope you've enjoyed it, and that you take its message to your hearts. THE END THE END The End You have just heard on stage a transcribed tour of New York's theatrical hits starring Mary Martin, Ray Bolger, Walter Hamlin, and Naomi Riordan. The music you have just heard was a portion of the ballet Slaughter on 10th Avenue, which Mr. Ray Bolger spoke of earlier as his first big hit. Your host during this half hour, dedicated to the 31st annual appeal of New York Catholic Charities, was Mr. Eddie Dowling, well-known Broadway producer and actor. Songs by Miss Martin and Mr. Bolger were recorded. The program was produced by William Marshall and edited by James Stacy. The program was produced by James Stacy.
