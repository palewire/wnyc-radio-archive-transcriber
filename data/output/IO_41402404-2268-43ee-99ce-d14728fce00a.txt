Today the Salvation Army commemorates its 31st annual Prison Sunday. In 1,200 penal institutions throughout the United States, the Army of Peace, with its brilliant flags, its uniforms, and its sounding brasses, has brought its message of friendship and goodwill to thousands of men and women, many of whom have half forgotten, if they ever knew, the meaning of goodwill and friendship. Tonight, Station WNYC brings you the Salvation Army's Brooklyn Citadel Band and male chorus in a program of Salvation Army music, under the direction of Captain Edward Lowcock. They will start their broadcast with a Salvation Army march, victors acclaimed by Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell Coles. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ The End The End You just heard the Brooklyn Citadel Band of the Salvation Army playing the march victors acclaimed.

This is the Salvation Army's Prison Sunday. This is the Salvation Army's Prison Sunday. I'm going to ask Major Berry once again to step to the microphone to tell us what this day means to her and her fellow officers and to the men and women in penal institutions throughout the nation, whom they have reached today. Major Berry. Major Berry. The End The End The End First of all, I think Prison Sunday brings proof to delinquents of all ages that they are remembered. For many of them, the closing of the prison doors means that the normal outside world grows misty and vanishes. I think it does them good to realize that in every major institution in the country, and in many smaller ones, our people come to them, not judging or condemning, not condescending, not even pitying, but with warm goodwill and friendship, and a very sincere wish to share the courage and hope that comes through religious experience. Some 200,000 men and women have had an opportunity to attend our services today, and perhaps half of them will actually be blessed by it. For some, it may be the renewal of earlier contacts. For others, their first meeting with our people. To our officers, Prison Sunday brings one of the greatest opportunities for service during the year. Though we cannot free the bodies of the men and women to whom we speak, we can, if they wish it, help free their minds. And thank you once again, Major Berry. And now the Brooklyn Citadel male chorus, directed by Mr. Walter Orr, will sing the much-loved hymn, Rock of Ages. Rock of Ages Rock of Ages Rock of Ages Rock of Ages The world's unknown See thee on Thy judgment bone Rock of ages Clears for me I will hide myself in thee That, of course, was the beautiful Rock of Ages sung by the Brooklyn Citadel male chorus directed by Mr. Walter Orr Now the Brooklyn Citadel band of the Salvation Army will play the Crusaders' hymn Beautiful Savior THE TAMMY Come on The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End In closing, the Brooklyn Citadel Band of the Salvation Army will play the hymn, Take Time to be Holy.
