The End Two little girls in blue, lads, two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love our two. And one little girl in blue, lads, who won your father's car. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have ripped her apart. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner, too. She was bred in old Kentucky. Take her, boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I see. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Come, rat, come, rat, come, rat, come, rat, come. When danger's reddish, my darling, old comrade, what's there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken. And a mother's heart, come, rat, come, rat, come, rat, come. And a mother's heart have broken. There is just another thing. From the old home that we've all. There is still a memory living. There's a father of forgiving. And a picture that is true. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Keep your eyes. Hold the wall. He's my sweetheart. I'm a moe. She's my Annie. I'm a joe. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Hold the wall. Give her a little bit It's my sweet heart One evening in the month of May I met old Satan on the way I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die If you want to get to heaven when you die If you want to get to heaven when you die Throw it up, throw it up, throw it down Throw it up, throw it down Throw it up, throw it down Throw it down, throw it down Throw it down, throw it down You're my darling, I'm a sweet girl Oh, it brings my heart to soul Don't think that the eye has needed That's a front to fight the fall Lay the white people for money That we can't no longer play That we can't no longer play To be continued...
