Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Your city station, WNYC, is now manhood that will take their place in the ranks of the police department in the exercises which will immediately follow. It's always a pleasant fact here that aside from the, we might say, the onerous duties of the police department, the responsibilities that they face, that also in that group is two of the finest musical organizations anywhere in the world, the police band and the police Blee Club. And now we're going to hear first, as properly, a note of music in the opening of this police program from the armory. And Sergeant Eddie Dillon will lead off, and Patrolman John Sisk, whose voice has sung over the air for a great many years and is known to everyone, will announce the content of the police Blee Club program. And now the police Blee Club is the first feature of the program. Thank you, Tom. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Glee Club will open its program by singing Zippity-Doo-Dah. Zippity-Doo-Dah, Zippity-Dee-Dah. My, oh, my, what a wonderful day. When the old sunshine head my way. Zippity-Doo-Dah, Zippity-Dee-Dah. Mr. Bluebird on my shoulder. It's the truth, it's actual. Everything is satisfaction. Zippity-Doo-Dah, Zippity-Dee-Dah. Wonderful feeling, wonderful day. This is just the kind of day that you dream about. When you open up your mouth a song of sound. Zippity-Doo-Dah, Zippity-Dee-Dah. My, oh, my, what a wonderful day. When the old sunshine head my way. Zippity-Doo-Dah, Zippity-Dee-Dah. It's the bluebird on my shoulder. It's the truth, it's actual. Everything is satisfaction. Zippity-Doo-Dah, Zippity-Dee-Dah. Wonderful feeling, wonderful day. Thank you. And now, ladies and gentlemen, one of our classical numbers from Sigmund Ronberg's New Moon, Stout-Hearted Men. The New Moon, Stout-Hearted Men. The New Moon, Stout-Hearted Men. The New Moon, Stout-Hearted Men. You who have dreams, if you have a day will come true and true. You'll find your dreams, through a bank it's come true. You, if you have a soul and a spirit, then the spirit you'll see it through.

These splendid athletes who are taking their part in the exercises here tonight present everything that strong, fine young manhood can mean to any organization. And the police department certainly is privileged to have a group of men like this to fall back on to protect life and property within the gates of our city. And now there's the applause. The men are filing out. We'll let you get some of the atmosphere here at the Armory. You know, it's a remarkable sight here. The blue uniforms and the dark hats. And as you look through the entire grouping of the men, there's that strange white line that marks their faces. It really creates an amazing effect. And now you have the department band split up so that you get music from all angles. And this close order drill will be one of the demonstrations of the training and accuracy of these men as they go through the different forms of this drill without any commands once it starts. In the meantime, they put on their uniforms. They look spick and span having just recovered from their athletics and their athletic outfits. The men are shaping up now. In just a moment, you'll hear the commands of their officer as he calls out the different forms of the drill. And the men go right ahead and perform these very interesting gyrations. It's one of the amazing factors. As we said before, we're used to that West Point spectacle up there on the Hudson in one of the most beautiful spots in the world. But the accuracy and fine, the men here in these police department exercises every year demonstrate what training, concentration, fine athletic prowess and all that enters into fine, healthy young manhood is able to achieve. On the field of valor. And now the close order drill is in full swing might we say. And that's exactly what they are doing. They're swinging by fours and eights and creating all sorts of patterns on the floor here at the Armory. This is one time when we do wish you had television instead of just an announcer's voice to try and encompass any such fine spectacle as is taking place here in the 27th century. And the first time we're going to be able to achieve what the drill is able to achieve on the field of valor. And now the close order drill is in full swing might we say. And that's exactly what they are doing. They're swinging by fours and eights and creating all sorts of patterns on the floor here at the Armory. This is one time when we do wish you had television instead of just an announcer's voice to try and encompass any such fine spectacle as is taking place here in the 27th century. In the 22nd engineer's combat armory here on Fort Washington Avenue. Men are coming up now and as the front ranks come to a halt it's interesting to watch the movement of the rear ranks through the faces of the men that are standing still in the front ranks. And if you don't think the audience likes this exhibition of drilling, not a command, but you should see what the men are doing here on the floor. There will be a very interesting program in the course of the evening. Naturally we will hear from Commissioner Wallander, the mayor, and the trophy awards that go along every year with these commencement exercises. There's only one New York and when you stand in an armory here and see an exhibition like this you understand why. It's a world city, it's a wonderful city, and it has to do everything about as well as anything can be done anywhere. And one thing you may be assured of, every day carries its thrill. The men are still drilling. The officers of the police department that drilled them, I think they're like, you might say, primadonna's in the wings, wondering just what's going to happen to the performance. Because this is very intricate, and yet the unmistakable technique of these men is remarkable. There hasn't been a month yet. The cameras are flashing and no doubt your papers tomorrow, those of published pictures, will give you a splendid pictorial idea of what happened here in the army tonight. The men are remarkable for their average size. I spoke before of the line of faces between the dark oaks and the dark hacks. And in these formation drills, nowhere in the world, particularly in the distance, do you notice that effect so much as the unique quality of that white line that represents the faces of the men, especially when they get far down on the roof floor here in the armory. One half of the group is marching one way, another half is marching the other. There's no confusion. Now they've lined up and they've met. They're making their own mind up what to do. Believe me, after the exercise they went through, they had a huge volleyball here. We weren't on the air at that time, but they certainly mixed up the audience. They'd get that big volleyball up in the air. The thing was about eight or ten feet in circumference. They'd get it up and then they'd start for a focal point of the armory, and then you'd see the audience scramble, those who had seats on the floor. At one time they came right into the, uh, Rostron here, and upset the commissioner and all the company. So they were fairly democratic about who they banged into with that volleyball. They knocked over microphones, Rostron, and everything else. A couple of times they completely disorganized the band, but they kept on going, and it was some sight to see that ball fly up into the air, the size of it, and the size of the men who were pushing it. Mr. Wallander shakes hands with, uh, patrolman closing. The Honorable William O'Dwyer, Kofi, Regulation Service revolving, patrolman James T. Murray, student who performed the outstanding act of police duty in the field during the training period. Patrolman Murray. Patrolman Murray. Patrolman Murray comes up. Mr. Wallander hands with the revolver, Kofi, and Chase's hands. In the name of the mayor of the city of New York, and now the cameramen are issuing their orders, and they're the most important orders of all. They just reformed the details, but we get a fine picture, and that's necessary. The Honorable Arthur W. Wallander Trophy, Regulation Service revolver, awarded to probationary patrolman, Vernon T. Branker, student who attained the second highest general average in all subjects. Patrolman Branker. Thank you. Commissioner Wallander now hands his own trophy to patrolman Branker, and the cameramen snapped the pictures, and they're having a little joke between themselves. It's too far away for me, but they're having a good laugh. And now the chief inspector, oh, there's the applause for the audience. The chief inspector's trophy, Regulation Service revolver, awarded to probationary patrolman Julius C. Brilla, student who attained the third highest average in all subjects. Patrolman Brilla. Commissioner Wallander just handed him the revolver. Now the Edwin R. Mosback trophy, Regulation Service revolver, awarded to probationary patrolman Walter D. Engdahl, student who attained the highest general average in slow fire, time fire, rapid fire shooting with police, Regulation Service revolver. The paging Mr. Mosback, if he's here, is not here. Commissioner Wallander made the award, and the cameramen have taken the picture, and the audience applauded. Now the men return to their ranks, and we have the psalm by the Reverend Isidore Frank, a chaplain of the police department. Happy is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. Happy is the man that walketh not in the law, but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf doth not wither, and whatsoever he doeth prospereth. The wicked are not so. The wicked are not so. We are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Wherefore the wicked shall not stand at the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. For the Lord regardeth the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked doth perish. Thank you very much, Chaplain Frank. And now ladies and gentlemen, and men of the department, offer W. Wallander, your commissioner. and the commissioner. Folks, I am particularly delighted tonight to have this opportunity to welcome the commissioners. Welcome the 607 graduates of our department and their friends to this ceremony. I want to congratulate the men who performed before us tonight as police recruits. They go out tomorrow to patrol the streets of our city. They've received an intensive training course in the recruits training school, and I know it's a severe test of their stamina and abilities to take it as we say. They've made good, folks, and I'm sure that they're going to perform creditably when they get out on the streets. They're going to be called upon to make sacrifices. There will be many trials and tribulations beset them, and they're fully aware of what faces them on the outside. They know that the job is not an easy one, that they're going to be called upon to face some serious situations, and I have the utmost confidence in their ability to come through with flying colors. I know, too, that they will perform in a manner that will uphold the traditions of the department, the best traditions of the department. Some of them have already done so in their training period. I know, too, that the people of the city of New York will be proud when they see them on the streets tomorrow, because they're trained and fit and looking forward to serve the people in the best way they can, the best way they know how. This is a fast-moving job, this business of policing this great city of ours. The men who are members of our department, they must be young and alert, and that goes for all ranks. And the order of the day is work. Work or get out. We don't have any fear of the men that we've seen tonight performing before us. We know that they will do a good job. They've proven themselves to be alert. They're physically fit. And I want to further add that they're all ex-servicemen. They've known the rigors of facing a very lawless enemy. They've come through with flying colors. And I'm sure they'll serve the city well as they have their country. The hours that they will be asked to do duty will sometimes be long and arduous. There will not be time and a half for overtime. But we'll manage to compensate them in a way that will be satisfactory to them. We'll recognize abilities, always. There will be promotion for you if you strive for it. As I said before, the tempo of this job is a swift one, particularly as a post-war proposition. We have been faced with an upsurge in crime. Those who have preceded you have met this challenge with great success, I might say. They've equipped themselves treasibly. And my hat is off to them. I had hoped that the mayor will be with us tonight. But right now, folks, we have just concluded a series of very important conferences dealing with the smallpox problem in our city. We have just met with the medical officers of our city and those who are in a position to provide the necessary vaccines. And I might add that throughout the afternoon I've met with him and with these medical officers as well. And the mayor has done a sterling job in getting the sufficient or the required vaccines that will take care of our people in the city. He's implored, and successfully done so, the drug industry to provide that necessary vaccine. And I'm sure that everybody will be well protected, not later than the next four or five days. We look forward to everybody being vaccinated within a very short time. Thanks to his honor, the mayor. As a former policeman, I know that there's no place he would rather be than right here with you at this time. He looks upon you as a former comrade. And in that light, he has asked me to express his sincere congratulations to you and to tell you of his profound interest in your welfare. And I assure you that this is genuine interest, gentlemen. No mayor has ever graced the rustum of that great office who had a more profound interest than our present one. For some time, it has been the hope of his honor of the mayor to give to the patrolman of the police department sufficient time off each week to compensate them for the arduous and exacting duties which they are required to perform. At the present time, the men receive but 32 hours off after six days of work, while in private employment, a working week of five days followed by approximately 64 hours off of the accepted standards. Cognizant of the fine service given by the men and with the assurance that the quality of this service will continue to improve under favorable working conditions, the mayor has authorized me. And it is my happy privilege at this time to announce the establishment of the patrolman's 11th squad duty chart effective 12 to 1 AM, May the 4th, 1947. I guess you don't like that. However, the new working chart will give the men 48 hours off instead of the usual 32 after each six hours of duty. This will permit them to spend more time with their families and to have more time for recreation and rest. We feel sure that with the additional time off, the morale, health and well-being of the men will materially improve and that this improvement will be reflected in the work of the police department in better service to the public. With the establishment of the 11th squad duty chart, I have increased the vacation period from 19 to 20 days for patrolmen in order that they will not be required to return and perform one tour of duty at the expiration of their vacation period. This additional day vacation plus the 48 hour period, which will proceed and follow the 20 days vacation will in effect make a total of 24 days vacation in all. Our fellow members of the police department, I want to assure you that this could only happen under a mayor such as we have today. He was once one of us. He knows what it is to patrol a beach. He knows what you men are up against all the time. And he realizes, when compensating you, as I have announced tonight, that he is only carrying a gun. He is only cherishing a desire which has long been in his heart. I want to tell you right now, men, he is quite a fellow. He is the most wholesome man I have ever met. He is for you all the time. And the chief officers of our department feel like he does. I join them in this sentiment. And I am sure that as one big family, we are going to do a great job for the people of our city. I urge you to go out and do the best you can at all times. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.
