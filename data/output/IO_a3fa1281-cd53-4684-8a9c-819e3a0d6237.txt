The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay Goodbye, Boom-Ers, just a new world To fight the lead I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am near at the front To fight the foe Give the soldier boys a marching And I can no longer stay I hear the beautiful calling Goodbye, darling, pray Come on now, sound Way, way down south Where the sun shines every day Soft skies of blue shine down anew And all the birds are singing Clear and clear and gay Come on, come on along Come on, join in the song Jump on, but it won't be long We're on our way It's pit for rain We're going down south To the air And some snakes The heart grow thunder That is why I long for you Lonely through the night I thunder Wondering, darling, if you're true Distance only lands and shams there Though the ocean waves divide Absence makes the heart grow far To the ocean waves divide Absence makes the heart grow far To the ocean waves divide Absence makes the heart grow fonder Longing to be near your side Be near your side She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. Sweet home. Sweet home.
