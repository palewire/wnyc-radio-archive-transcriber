We ask your kind permission to recess the program to which you have been listening, in order that we may bring you the reception by the Honorable Vincenar and Pelletere to His Excellency the President of Ecuador, Galo Platze. The weatherman has turned out to be a very good friend to Ecuador because we had expected, according to weather reports, that we'd have showers and thunderstorms just about this time. But I don't need to tell you that the sun is shining beautifully here. A very large crowd has turned out to take part in this program because they feel kind of a personal kinship to Mr. Galo Platze because he was born on 8th Street, right on the outskirts of Greenwich Village, in the Hotel Marlton at Number 5, just off Fifth Avenue. His father at that time was in the consular service of the City of New York and was later ambassador at Washington. And for that reason, Greenwich Village, that old province of the City of New York, came into a great deal of publicity. And with a true sense of loyalty, he slipped away, as most of you have read in your papers, and made a trip down to the Hotel Marlton in order to overlook, or look rather, to see that nothing was overlooked, I should say, and that he would see the place of his birth once more. He's had an interesting time here in New York City, as he did in his younger years, and he's tried his best to recapture some of those events by slipping away once in a while to take part in some of the memorial factors of his early days here in New York. Now, Mr. Whelan has just escorted the mayor and his guests to the platform here at City Hall, and in a few moments you'll hear the voice of Mr. Whelan presiding and ready to present the regular order of program. Our fire department are now lining up with those beautiful silk flags that dress the square here so magnificently whenever there is an occasion of this kind and protocol is observed. And we're just watching now for a signal from Mr. Whelan, the mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Vincent Arum Pelletere, is standing there beside Mr. Plaza. The president of Ecuador has a light gray suit. He looks like an ordinary, everyday businessman, and he's quite keen about everything, and the newspaper men are giving some orders. They're not even waiting for the program to take place. He's just raised his hand and shook his hand, rather, to a crowd here. And now Mr. Whelan has asked the group to be seated. In just a moment you'll hear his voice starting the program. Mr. Whelan has just called for the anthem. No one with the microphone orANE route to find him. Well, he's Paty, he's menging the erased national anthem, and he isvere quê! There are many s بت between the gang. Mr. Whelan looks at his left and his Bolsonaro and his norte has anчто. Still this out there, he's chosen, he's сообщ shrimp, and he's a starry party, and his stars are quite mates. Mr. Who talks about consent, if he likes to getalayers 보� it. Hello, Guanty%, Jimmy. Oh! He's been asking, frankly, for��'s guest to be seated available, he's being asked for a good week. We've spent two out! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's a great privilege, Mr. Mayor, to present to you His Excellency Gallo Plaza, President of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of Ecuador. This future president, this future president, determined to teach modern agricultural methods to his neighbors. Taking over his family's farm, he was a part of the country's farm, and the whole agricultural of Ecuador, the whole agricultural system of Ecuador shows the results of his teaching. In becoming interested in politics, which is the science of government, Gallo Plaza worked his way up through the difficult paths of government to become president of his nation, which position of great honor had previously been held by his distinguished father. father. In the presidency, he brought peace and freedom to a strife-ridden nation, and has constantly sought to preserve and strengthen the warm friendship between his country and our own. Between our nations, there is much common ground. Both are democracies. Both are nations of vast distances, lofty mountains, wide farms, and great rivers. But most of all, Ecuador and the United States are alike in the love both of our peoples have for freedom. We thrive on free speech and the free press. We detest government by suppression and secret police methods. We believe that as nations become more free, they become more strong. We believe that our nations develop in peace rather than in war. We seek no conquest other than the mastery of science, philosophy, and nature for the benefit of all the peoples of all the world. Your Excellency President Plaza, fellow New Yorker, you can do this city, common to us all, a great service. Yours has been an unusual experience. And because of it, you are exceptionally equipped to carry back the message of New York and of this nation. We ask you to tell the people of Ecuador that we are their firm friends. We ask you to tell them that the feeling of this city represents the feeling of this nation. With Ecuador, we pray that our friendship with other strong democracies will enable us to keep peace all over the world. On behalf of the people of the city of New York, Mr. President, I offer you this certificate of distinguished service. The mayor of the city of New York has just handed the scroll now to the President of Ecuador, His Excellency Gallo Plaza. And the cameramen are asking for a particular pose now with the scroll, with the President of Ecuador and His Honor the Mayor. And in just a few moments, no doubt, the President will respond. He's quite tall, a good-looking fellow, dressed in a light gray suit, looks like an ordinary everyday citizen. If he wasn't on this platform, being honored and received by the mayor of the city of New York today, to a man, as the mayor said, who was born on the sidewalks of New York, not exactly, at the Hotel Marlton at number 5, West 8th Street, just off Fifth Avenue on the outskirts of Greenwich Village. Mr. President, the mayor. So, all of the audience present here and all of the people listening in to the radio will know exactly how the people of the city of New York, whom I represent, feel about you. I would like to read, for their benefit, the contents of this scroll. For distinguished and exceptional public service, Office of the Mayor of the City of New York, know all these men by these presence that I, Vincent R. Impelitari, Mayor of the City of New York, do hereby cite for distinguished and exceptional public service, His Excellency Gallo Plaza, President of Ecuador, under whose progressive administration the Republic of Ecuador has modernized its manufacturing and transportation, and whose leadership has made Ecuador known throughout the world as a protector of freedom of the press, speech, worship, and assembly, and who has brought to his country political stability and material prosperity. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the City of New York to be affixed this 25th day of June 1951, signed, Vincent R. Impelitari. I hand it to you, Mr. President, with the thankful appreciation of all the people of the City of New York. Thank you very much. The gentleman now asking for a please shout... His Excellency... And now the mayor. I beg your pardon. Mr. Whelan. President Gallo Plaza. Mr. Mayor. Distinguished... Dignitaries of the City Government. Ladies and gentlemen. With deep emotion, I receive, in behalf of the people of Ecuador, your greetings, in the name of this city, which is both a symbol and a powerful expression of the creative capacity of our times. New York represents the greatest mass of steel and stone, of industry and achievement in all fields, of science, social welfare, and in high spiritual values, not only of your country, but of our civilization of today. This is why New York was selected as the seat of the United Nations, because it's at the crossroads of the world. A center for reunion and friendly cooperation of people, of races, and of cultures. It is proof of the successful operation of a living democracy. New York is also a monument to tolerance, which is an indication of the cultural development of its inhabitants. New York, the ability of people of different races, religions, and traditions to live together in understanding and friendship is the only manner in which man can bring himself closer to his God. This city is very dear and very near to my heart because I was born here. When my father was Ecuador's diplomatic representative in the United States, I have lived and worked here as well as made many lasting friendships. New York, as no other city has in an atmosphere truly democratic, used its immense spiritual and material resources to improve the living conditions of its inhabitants and has shown the world that this melting pot of nationalities is capable of producing the most imposing demonstration of human achievement in our time. Many thanks, gentlemen, for your reception. I am greatly moved by having been given the opportunity to renew sentimental ties of affection which since birth have kept me always close to New York. I may say that having been honored with this document that the mayor of the city handed me this morning to put at the service of my people freedom, the right to believe in what they think and the right to be governed by the men they elect into office is for me a very great honor. And I may say at this time that I believe firmly in those principles because they are part of my second nation, second nature. As a boy here in the United States and particularly here in New York, I learned to understand what freedom and what tolerance meant to men. And I have tried to take that, take those virtues and those rights back to my people. And now they enjoy what you people have enjoyed for so long. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. President, the President of Ecuador, Gallo Plaza, respond to the mayor of the city of New York. The photographers now are demanding a few pictures. Mrs. Impletaria is escorting Mrs. Gallo Plaza. The police police club will give us a selection before we leave. Mrs. Gallo Plaza. It's a lovely day today, and whatever you've got to do, I wish I had me to be doing it with you. But if you've got something that must be done, and it can only be done by one, there is nothing more to say, except it's a lovely day for St. Paul. It's a lovely day, it's a lovely day today, and whatever you've got to do, you've got a lovely day to do it in the truth. And I hope whatever you've got to do, is something that can be done by two. For I really like to say, it's a lovely day today, and whatever you've got to do, I wish I had me to be doing it with you. But if you've got something that must be done, and it can only be done by one, there is nothing more to say, except it's a lovely day for St. Paul. It's a lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely day. Mr. Whelan. Will those on the platform please remain seated until the mayor escorts the president from the platform. The receptionist. The mayor of the City of New York, the Honorable Vincent Arum Pelletere, has just tendered the honors of the City of New York to a young man who was born in its precincts just a few, barely a mile we might say from City Hall, on West 8th Street, New York. At number five at the Hotel Malton, when his father was in the consular service of the city. Mr. Gallo Plaza today surprised us very much by his excellent English, because when we hear of a South American Republic, we at least expect to hear a trace of an accent. But he spoke and attested the fact that he's a real New Yorker, born on the sidewalks of New York, to use a colloquialism, although he was a bit sheltered at the time. And New York has been very happy indeed to welcome this stalwart from the ancient land of Ecuador, there on the west coast of South America. The mayor of the City of New York has turned to the scroll, the photographers have recorded the entire scene, and for those of you who did not witness it, you may do so through the media, newspapers, movies, television, and other pictorial factors. And so that is all now from City Hall. We return you now to the studios and join the program now in progress. WNYC, the voice of New York City.
