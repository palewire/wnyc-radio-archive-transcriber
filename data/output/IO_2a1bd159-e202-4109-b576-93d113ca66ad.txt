My goodness! Oh, what's the trouble? Well, this is the Children's Yuletide Festival, isn't it? Why, yes. Yes, it is. Of course it is. It's 5.30, and the Children's Yuletide Festival is always presented at this time. Well, that's what I thought, but, well... Oh, you're still troubled? What now? Well, the studio looks different than it did yesterday. Well, of course. We're doing a different show today. We're doing Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll. Oh, and that's why you have a looking glass over there. Naturally. You can't expect us to do a show realistically without the proper effects. Of course. Then do I get to play Alice today? My name is Alice, you know. No, I'm sorry, but Teresa Keene is playing Alice. You promised. You promised me yesterday that I could play. Well, I said I'd consult, and so I did. And we held a conference and... Who? Who? Why, the Municipal Broadcasting System, which presents the show, and Edward Goldberger, who adapted the script, and Mitchell Grayson, who directs it, and, uh, and me. Oh. But you can watch if you want to. I don't mind. Look, why don't you go over there and sit by the mirror? All right. What are these things here? Chessmen. Chessmen? Well, certainly. We always use them when we have a conference. Chess is so logical, you know. Oh, is it? Of course it is. Everybody knows that. Well, I didn't. Well, you're an exception, then. Well, if I didn't know it, then everybody doesn't know it. Well, it's the exception that proves the rule. Page 42, paragraph 4, rule book. And besides, you're really not the card. It moved. It moved. What moved? The chessmen. It moved. Well, why not? According to the rules, a move must be made in a chess game every half hour. Oh, but... Well, that's enough of that, now. You go and sit there and by the looking glass. We have work to do. Mr. Nopter, have you ever been on the other side of a looking glass? Other side? Well, I've been in back of them, but never anything else. I wonder what's inside one. Looking glasses are such curious things. Not at all. Not at all. According to the laws of physics, looking glasses merely reflect what's going on in a room. In strict accordance with certain... Oh, dear. There you go again. What did you say? I said you're starting again. Starting what? Talking. It always makes me so sleepy. Nonsense. Why, this is educational. You should always pay attention to educational conversation. You know, you might learn something. I might, and I mightn't. Hmm. Well, as I was saying, the image in the looking glass, while always in reverse, is also reflected at a distance from the glass in direct ratio to the distance of the object and the surface of the glass. Now, this can be demonstrated by a simple experiment. Why, the glass is all misty. And it's disappearing. I believe I could just walk through if I wanted to. Yes, I shall. I'll walk right through it. There. I... I've done it. So, this is looking glass lens. It's very peculiar. But, there's a door. I wonder where it leads. I do just wonder. I might as well try that as anything else. This is the most annoying garden. All the roads lead back from where they came from. I never saw such a garden for getting in the way. Never. I do wish there was someone to tell me the way. Wish this tiger lily could talk. We can talk. When there's anything worth talking about. Oh, my goodness. Can all the flowers talk? As well as you can. And a good deal louder. Oh, my goodness. It isn't manners for us to begin, you know. And I really was wondering when you begin. Well, aren't you sometimes frightened at being flattered out here with no one to take care of you? There's a tree in the middle. What else is it good for? What could it do if danger came? Oh, it could bark. It says bow out. That's why its branches are called bough. Didn't you know that? Why, how is it you all speak so nicely? I've been in many gardens before, but none of the flowers could talk. Put your hand down and feel the ground. Then you'll know why. It's very hard, but I don't see what that has to do with it. In most gardens, they make the beds too soft. So the flowers are always asleep. I never thought of that before. In my opinion, you never think at all. I never saw anybody that looked stupid. Oh, hold your tongue as if you ever saw anybody. Are there any more people in the garden besides me? There's one other that can move about like you. But she's a little bit different than you, you know. Is she really like me? Well, she has the same awkward shape as you, but she's redder. Does she ever come out here? I dare say you'll see her soon. She's one of the kind with nine spikes, you know. Oh, where does she wear them? Why, all around her head, of course. I was wondering you hadn't got some too. I thought it was the regular rules. She's coming. I hear her footsteps along the walk. Why, it's the red queen from the press there. She's grown a good deal, though. It's the fresh air that does it. Wonderfully fine air it is out here. I think I'll go and meet her. Oh, you couldn't possibly do that. I should advise you to walk the other way. You're bound to meet her again, Julie. Where do you come from? Where are you going? Look up, speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers all the time. I lost my way. I don't know what you mean by your way. All the ways around here belong to me. But why did you come here at all? Curtsy, while you're thinking, save time. Time for you to answer now. Open your mouth a little wider when you speak, and always say, your majesty. I only wanted to see what the garden was like to be a majesty. Well, why don't you look out over there, then, and see the whole country? Why, I declare. It's knocked out just like a large chessboard. There are even men moving in it. It's a huge game of chess played all over the world. But this is the world. Oh, how I wish I was one of them. I wouldn't mind being a pawn if only I might join. Of course, I could like to be a queen's best. Well, that's easily managed. You can be the white queen's pawn. If you like, it's Lily too young to play. Come, run. Run. Faster. Faster. Faster. Where are we? Don't try to talk. Faster. Faster. Are we nearly there? Nearly there. We passed it ten minutes ago. Faster. Faster. There. You may rest now. I do believe we're in the district the whole time. Why, everything's just as a fly. Of course it is. What did you expect? Well, in our country, you'd generally get somewhere else if you ran very fast for a long time. A slow sort of country. Now here, you see, it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place. I'd rather just stay here now, please. Well, while you're resting, I'll just take the measurements. At the end of three yards, I shall give you directions. At the end of four, I shall repeat them. Then at the end of five, I shall say goodbye. And at the end of six, I shall go. Are you ready? Yes, Your Majesty. A pawn goes two squares at its first move, you know. So you'll go very quickly through the third square. And then just follow yourself. Oh, yes, Your Majesty. Speak in French when you can't think of the English for a thing. Turn out your toes when you walk. And remember who you are. Always remember who you are. Goodbye. There's a signpost. Oh, that's a comfort. To Toodle Dumb's house. The other one says, To Toodle Dee's house. They're both pointing the same way. I do believe they live in the same house. I'll just call and... Oh, there we are. Of course. Your Tweedled, Emma, I know. He's got it right there in the collar. If you think we're waxworks, you ought to pay, you know. Waxworks weren't made to be looked at for nothing, no how. And contrary-wise, you know, if you think we're alive, you ought to speak. I'm sure I'm very sorry. I know what you're thinking about, but it isn't so, no how. And contrary-wise, if it was so, it might be. And if it were so, it would be. But as it isn't, it ain't. Now, that's lucky. Well, I was thinking, which is the best way out of this wood? Would you tell me, please? Oh, you've begun wrong. The first thing in a visit is to say, how do you do, and shake hands. Very well. Oh, thank you. You're really getting very dark. You think it's going to rain? No, I don't think so. I've put up the umbrella so it won't rain here, at least, no how. But it may rain outside. Oh, it may if it chooses. We have no objections. Come contrary-wise. Selfish thing. Do you see that? It's only a rattle, not a rattlesnake. You know, only an old rattle. Quite old and broken. I know it was. It's spoiled, of course. You wouldn't be so angry about an old rattle. But it isn't old. It's new. I bought it yesterday. My nice little rattle. And he did it. Tweedlebee. I did it. Of course, you'll agree to have a battle. Well, oh dear, I suppose so. Only she must have to help us to dress up, you know. I hope you're good at pinning and tying things. Oh, yes. Very well. We'll start then. Help me with these tin things. Help me with mine now. Right. There. So you're both all fixed up now. Do I look very pale? Well, yes, a little. I'm very brave, generally. Only today I happen to have a headache. Oh, and I have. Oh, I got such toothache. You know, I'm far worse off than you. Well, then you'd better not fight again. Oh, we must have a bit of a fight, but I don't care about it's going on long. What time is it? Why, it's half past four. Let's fight till six and have that. Very well. And then she can watch it. Hmm. I don't suppose there'll be a tree left standing for ever so far around when we're finished. Maybe Jew hit about us, though. He'd all about a rattle. I wouldn't have minded so much if it hadn't been a new one. There's only one sword, you know, Tweedledee. But you can have the umbrella. It's quite a sharp. Only we must begin quickly. It's getting dark as it can. And darker. Oh, what a sick black cloud that is. How fast it comes. I don't believe it has wings. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! The crow! The crow! The crow! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, silly. Now they've run away. But it did stop the battle. They never get me here, though. Even though it does make a fierce wind. I hear somebody's shawl being blown away. If you please, is this your shawl? Bread and butter. Bread and butter. Am I addressing the White Queen? Well, if you call that addressing, it isn't my notion of the thing at all. If your majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I'll put it on for you. But I don't want it done at all. I've been addressing myself for hours. Here, let me in, obviously. But every single thing is crooked. And what a state you're hearing. The brushes got entangled in it. And I lost the comb yesterday. Well, you need a ladies maid. I'll give you a pleasure. Two cans a week and jam every other day. I don't want you to hire me. I don't care for jam. Well, it's very good jam. Well, I don't want any today at any rate. I couldn't have any today if you didn't want it. The rule is jam yesterday and jam tomorrow. But never jam today. But sometimes it must come to jam today. No, no, it doesn't. It's jam every other day. Today isn't any other day, you know. I don't understand you. You know, it's very confusing. That's the effect of living backwards. It always makes one a tribal giddy at first. It is. Oh, of course. I never think of such a thing. But there's one great advantage in it. One's memory works both ways. I'm sure mine only works one way. I only remember things after they happen. Oh, poor sort of memory, that. What sort of things do you remember best? Oh, things that happen the week after night. The king's messenger's been in prison being punished. The trial doesn't even begin until next Wednesday. And of course the crime comes last of all. But if he never commits a crime. All the better. But if he's punished for something he didn't do. Weren't you ever punished? Oh, yes, Your Majesty. And grant you all the better for it afterwards. Yes, but... Oh, my finger's bleeding. Oh, what's the matter? Have you hurt your finger? I haven't yet, but I shall. When do you think you'll do it? When I pass a national. Oh, there it goes. You're holding it all crooked. Now the pin's gone into your finger. Oh, dear. Oh, that accounts for the bleeding, you see. Why don't you scream now? Why, I've done all the screaming already. What's the good of doing it all over again? Oh, this whole thing's impossible. I can't believe it. Don't you try again. Take a deep breath and shut your eyes. There's no use trying. I can't believe impossible things. It's because you haven't had enough breakfast. When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. You know, sometimes I believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. This is really too much. I've simply got to go now. Perhaps I'll see you again on another square. Well, I'm out of the forest. That's one square, Donald, anyway. But there's an egg on the wall. No. No, it's not an egg. It's Humpty Dumpty. How exactly like an egg he is. It's very provoking to be called an egg. Very. I said you look like an egg, sir. And some eggs are very chickeny nuts. Some people have no more sense than a baby. Oh, don't stand there mumbling. State your name of business. Well, my name is Alice, but... That's a stupid enough name. What does it mean? Must the name mean something? Of course it must. My name means the shape I am. And a good, handsome shape it is. But with a name like yours, you might be any safer through. Why do you sit out here all alone? Because there's nobody with me, of course. Think I didn't know the answer to that. Hmph. Ask me another. Don't you think you'd be safer on the ground? That wall is very narrow. What easy wittles, you ask? Of course I don't think so. If I ever did fall off, and there's no chance of it, mind you. If I did, the king has promised me with his very own mouth... He sent all his horses and all his names. Oh, that's too bad. You've been listening at doors and down chimneys. You couldn't have known. I did nothing of the sort. It's in a book. Thank you.
