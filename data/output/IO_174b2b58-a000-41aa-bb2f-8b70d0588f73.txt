Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming. Oh, broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, for the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming.

Your Honor, Mayor O'Dwyer, I have the distinct honor to present to you and through you to the people of the city of New York, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, His Excellency Lear Kut Ali Khan, Mayor O'Dwyer. Your Excellency, Prime Minister, and your charming lady, members of the entourage. We welcome you both to New York City with a hearty welcome that it is our privilege to bestow on personages of such importance and as friends. we congratulate you, sir, as your country approaches the third year of freedom, freedom for its 80 million people. New York City, traditionally the home of democratic people from every country in the world, has watched with deep interest the growth and development of the movement which brought freedom to Pakistan. Your career, Mr. Prime Minister, as a major part of that movement, has for many years been close to our hearts. We know of your great experience in government administration, which helped Pakistan to emerge as a state. We know of the confidence with which you look to the future because of the well-considered plans your government has made. All of us hope that Pakistan and the United States, separated as they are by half the circumference of the globe, still will be close in national feeling because of the common desire for peace that governs the minds of both peoples. Yours is a new nation, which has arisen from an ancient culture. Ours is an older nation, whose culture is new, but the desires for freedom are common to us both. Our mutual confidence and our work for its fulfillment will help save the world for the future. With all our hearts, we hope that you and your charming lady will have a happy visit, and that as you learn more of our nation, we too will learn from you. On your return to the great Indo-Pakistan subcontinent, we ask that you favor our single request, and that is this. We request you to tell your people emphatically, with all the great powers at your command, that we are their admiring friends, and that we join them in their every hope for future peace. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, His Excellency the Prime Minister of Pakistan. Your Honor, Mr. Mayor, My wife and I are overwhelmed by the reception you have given us, and by the general words you have spoken. This is my first visit to New York, and indeed to this continent. I was looking forward to this visit, because I was to see with my own eyes, not only the colossal progress that your country has made, but what it was that made this rapid progress possible. Already I have seen enough to admire your vigorous spirit of enterprise, your optimistic outlook, and the opportunity which your country gives to every individual man or woman to rise to the best of his or her capacities. I am even more impressed by the kindliness and simple affections of your people, the people of which I have received much wonderful proof today. Your city has endeared itself to the world by its great traditions of hospitality and welcome. Of the guests that you have received in the past and will receive in the future, I regard myself as amongst the humblest, but also amongst the proudest. You have not only honoured me, but more so my country, Pakistan. May you prosper, and by your wide and liberal sympathies, please continue to bring honour to yourself and to your great nation and country. Thank you, Your Excellency. And I would be very happy if the wonderful woman who has done so much for the people of her country, the Begum, would acknowledge an introduction. The Begum Leacat has just stood to acknowledge the applause in a traditional costume, and she's very beautiful indeed, very short, very dark, and beautifully dressed in the costume of Pakistan. ...of the direction of Sergeant Dillon.
