WNYC's American Music Festival, program number 112, the music of Ned Roram. Janet Lauren, soprano, Leslie Oaks, flutist, and Ellen Greenberg, violinist, are to be our guests, with Betty Crawford and composer Ned Roram himself as our pianists, and this broadcast devoted to the works of 21-year-old Chicago-born Ned Roram. Mr. Roram studied theory and some composition with Leo Sowerby in Chicago and Albert Nolte at Northwestern University. He was at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia for a year, where he did work with Scalero, and after that he came to New York. At the present time, Ned Roram is writing music in New York and studying orchestration with Virgil Thompson. He's had performances in Chicago, in Washington, D.C., and in New York, but only has he been actively leading the life of a composer, as he says, as opposed to that of a student, since he came East, and that is for about one year. We shall hear first Ned Roram's suite of three pieces for voice, flute, violin, and piano, entitled In Piazza's Palladio. The music of this suite was written to the words of Mr. Roram's friend Bruce Finester. The three pieces, which will be played without interruption, are subtitled Hades, Noon, and Spring. Now we hear Ned Roram's suite of three pieces for voice, flute, violin, and piano, as interpreted by Jeanette Lauren, soprano, Leslie Oaks, flutist, Ellen Greenberg, violinist, and the composer Ned Roram himself at the keyboard.吉LO Mack, foot, violin, keyboard, violin,세� Roram's�urs piece of wood penguins, if you can see the instrument type, the scored.
