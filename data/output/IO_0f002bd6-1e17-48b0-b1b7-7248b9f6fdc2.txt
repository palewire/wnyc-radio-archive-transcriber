Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their kids and their kids, down a lot on the door. Oh, pray somebody's a-goin' to rob them out without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? What for? I've got no mule, I've got no mule, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to me. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my song, my head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no sun, got no moon, and the people see. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty. I've got plenty of nothing, and I'm not worried. I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, and it's time to rise. Never worry long, and I'm well. Never want to strive to be gone, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, for heaven's a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my lord. I've got my gals, got my lord. I've got my gals, got my gals. I've got my gals, got my gals, got my gals, got my gals.
