In Your Name, presented by the American Red Cross, the story of humanity in action starring Gerald Moore. So today is the wedding, and everybody's happy, including me. Even though my leg is still a little shaky, I'll be able to get down that aisle in style. Just watch. Oh, no, no, those bells aren't ringing for me. It's my partner, Terry. He's getting married, and I'm the best man. Don't keep us waiting, Hank. That's all I'm telling you. That's Terry. He's marrying my kid sister, Joanie. You might stop calling me kid sister on my wedding day. She was just a kid when I left the Army. Hank, stop dawdling and fix that tie. That's Helen, my wife. Hurry now. I'll get there on time. My leg's in pretty good shape. And Terry doesn't have his arm in a sling anymore. You know, for a while, it looked like this wedding just wasn't going to come off. Yeah. Throughout the world, service to humanity is symbolized by the one banner under which all men may serve. The Red Cross. Here's a transcribed story of service to others. Service offered by the Red Cross in your name. Listen now to Gerald Moore starring in our play, Partners. Yeah. We were all partners. First, just me and Terry. Now my wife and Joanie guide the finances, too. We came out of the Army, Terry and me, and got a GI loan, bought a truck, and we were in business. So, one rainy night, we're heading back to Mapleton with a tomato pack loaded high to the tailboard. And we're making for the cannery line, and I'm doing my best to make time, because the earlier we hit the line, the better price we're going to get. Maybe. Maybe. Step on it, Hank. We're going fast enough. Oh, come on, Hank. We want to be first in line. What do you want to do, break our necks in this rain? It's just a sprinkle. Some sprinkle. We're going fast enough. Yeah, let me take the wheel, huh? Sit where you are, Terry. Sit right where you are. I'll do the driving tonight. I own half the truck, don't I? Yeah. Right now, I own the steering half. Ah, we can make better time than this, Hank. I can drive rings around you, morning, noon or night, rain or shine. You can, huh? Mm-hmm. Yeah, maybe so. But tonight, I want to deliver all tomatoes and no ketchup. Oh, we got to be first in line, Hank. And I want to get back in time to see Joanie tonight. Ah, she'll be waiting for you, partner. Yeah, but she expects you all in one piece. All I want to do is stick to the road. Ah. Come on, huh? Let me take the wheel. Will you wait till the rain lets up? Sure she's waiting for you. With Helen, I'll bet. In the living room right now, making plans for the wedding. I hope so. Waiting for us to sell this load and come home with a few more bucks to sock in that old sugar bowl. You know, Terry, we're a couple of lucky guys, you and me. The boys are a little late. Oh, now, don't you worry, Joanie. If they're going in for trucking, you might just as well get used to waiting. Oh, I don't mind the waiting, Helen. Really, I don't. Oh, yes, you do. But you get used to it, in a way. It's just that they're late. They said eight o'clock. Yeah, and it's past ten. Well, it's a long trip. Maybe it took them time to load. Or maybe they ran into traffic on the road. Or rain. That's how it is. And you might just as well get used to it. Don't be so down in the mouth, kid. We'll get a good spot on the line. Yeah. Sure we will. Oh, loading those tomatoes sure knocked me out. You sleepy, Hank? Yeah, a little bit. All right, then. Let me take the wheel. No. Gosh. Just keep talking to me. Keep talking. I'll do okay. All right. What'll I talk about, Hank? Hmm, anything. Boy, it sure would be nice to have a radio on these trips. Yeah. Just drive along and listen to the sweet music. I sure wish we had a radio. Well, radio's gonna have to wait. Oh, yeah. All I do is wait. We had to wait for a GI loan. We had to wait for a truck. We got it. Yeah, and now we gotta wait for a radio. Hey, partner. You know we're short on finances. Oh, why are we stopping, Hank? It's a fork. Which road will we take? Oh, the river road. It's shorter. It's tougher. Maybe parts washed out. Oh, then they'd have signs up, Hank. I don't know. Let's take the longer one, huh? What's the matter? You scared of a tough piece of road? Here, let me behind that wheel. Come on. Sit tight. Oh, but Hank, we're gonna make the end of the line. And by the time we get into the cannery, those tomatoes are gonna be soup. We gotta take the river road. Come on. Give me the wheel. Just sit where you are. We gotta take the river road, Hank. All right. It's the river road. They're both good drivers, I know. Now, don't you fret, Joanie. If they run into trouble, Hank'll know what to do. It's worth plugging for, Terry. This is tough work, but if things pan out, maybe we can rent a little office. Yeah. Advertise. Pick up some trucking jobs. Yeah. Maybe even buy another truck or a van. Yeah, yeah. Maybe even a trailer. Long before then, you and Joanie will be married. You'll see, kid. Our partnership's no mistake. We'll do okay. Say, you and Joanie set the date yet? I said, did you... Hey. Hey. He's asleep. Well, I'll be... Terry. Terry! Terry! Huh? What? Terry! Terry! Terry! I... I told you to give me the wheel. I couldn't help it. My... My arm! Terry! Terry! The kid, doctor. Get... Get to the kid. Just lie back now. Terry! Terry! Don't move that leg. Doc. How is he? Now lie back and don't try to move. We'll get you to the hospital. But he don't say anything. Terry! Terry! Terry! Are they badly hurt? Well, not critically. Can we see them now? They've just come out of emergency. I think you'd better come back tomorrow. What... What happened out there on the road? Well, a number of people were hurt out there. A cloudburst hit that section of the river road. A cloudburst? Yes. They were quite fortunate we got to them in time. The water rose several feet and poured out of the road. If they'd remain pinned in the truck, well... How you feeling, Terry? Fine. Just fine. I got my right leg in a cast. Yeah, my left one is... We got one good pair of legs between us. Some partnership. And my arm. You should have kept your eyes open. I did. I wasn't sleeping. No, you weren't sleeping. Oh, no. I wasn't. You were fast asleep. Ah, cut it out. Yeah, don't you remember? There was a thunderclap, like a cannon. Water hit like a sledge. Ah, you dreamed it. Oh, now listen... Why don't you let me take the wheel? Well, I wanted you to get some rest, kid. Ah, you sure fixed it. I'll be resting, all right, with a busted leg. And I'm supposed to get married in two weeks. In two weeks? Yeah, yeah. Oh, gosh. I'm sorry, Terry. Only I wish you wouldn't be sore, because it wasn't... Why shouldn't I be sore? We put our last nickel in a pack of tomatoes, work like horses loading them, and crack up on the way back. And I'm supposed to be married in two weeks. Well, it's a rotten break, but... In the truck. It must be a pile of junk. Yeah, it must be. A new job, too. It's a lucky thing we got it insured. Uh, Terry... The... The truck, there's, uh... There's no insurance. No insurance? Well, after you bought that ring for Joanie, we didn't have the money, so I... Why didn't you tell me, you sap? Why didn't you tell me? I was. I was gonna tell you. Figured after we sold a pack, I... You figured, you lame brains. You couldn't figure your way out of your shoes at night. Now, wait a minute. Ah, shut up! The End Still sore at me, Terry? Honest kid, I... I don't blame you for being sore. I know how it is. Me and Helen had it the same way. We set a date, and then our mother needed an operation, and... Ah, come on. You really got no right to be sore at me, Terry. If... Look, if you want me to, I'll... I'll pay for all the damage. I don't have the dough now, but I'll get it someplace. I... Ah, shut up. Well, this is just lovely. Instead of being grateful you came out of this alive, you're gonna lie next to each other like a couple of clans. Ah, it's him. He's sore. You're supposed to be partners, Terry. Sure. I don't even want to turn his way. The partnership is busted as of now. It's just a pile of junk on the river road. Maybe the truck can be repaired. With what? We don't have a button. I'll get a loan on my engagement ring. No. No, Joanie, you can't do that. I certainly will. I'm not going to let sentimentality stand in the way, Terry. Joanie, Joanie, the... The ring, it's... It's a real diamond. Yeah, yeah, but... But I only made a down payment. Oh. I... I figured after we sold the tomato pack... We ought to get together on our figuring, partner. Out of one tomato pack, which is now soup, we were gonna rent an office, insure the truck, pay for an engagement ring, pay for a wedding, and set you up in married life. And even have enough left over for another truck. I don't think there are that many tomatoes in the whole world. Ah, look, Terry, I'm not sore, and I don't want you to think it was my fault. We can be partners again, huh? We'll start from that pile of junk on the road and this time use our heads. And do all our figuring out loud. Are you listening to me? Maybe you want some of these chocolates, kid, huh? Oh, gosh, I don't think Joanie's sore about the ring. Come on, Terry, they got chocolate on the inside, some of them. What kind do you like? Ah, go ahead, take some. See if you can find a truck in that candy box. Well, ladies, with the towing and the repairing, the whole job should cost about $500. $500? Yeah. That's a lot of money, mister. And this truck needs a lot of repairing. You'd have to pay almost that much for parts. $500? We don't have that kind of money. The cost of repairs will be about $500. How do you know? Don't ask me questions now. Just listen. $500? How do you know? And the same goes for you. Now, we can get the job done. Where? We said just listen. But before we go any further, are you still partners? Oh, sure, I never broke. How do you feel about that, Terry? I still own half the truck. Is that yes? Yeah. If he'll let me drive it. Okay. Okay. Now, where are we going to get the job done? Ah, there's one more thing. What? You'll have to make Joanie and me partners. We're going to help manage the finances. Do you accept? That's a deal. You'll get most of it anyway. Do you agree, Terry? You think you ought to say yes, kid? Yeah. All right. Now, this morning, we went to the Red Cross. We heard that they're helping many people who were hurt, or lost houses and crops and tools in that cloudburst and flash flood. The Red Cross? What do you know? They said they would? Well, the truck is essential to our livelihood. I'll say it's essential. They sent a man out to get an estimate on the job. Partners, I think we got a truck again. And next time, no tomatoes. Will you let me drive? Sure, partner. I'll let you drive through the next cloudburst, and tell me if you're dreaming. Thank you, Gerald Moore, for your splendid performance.

Dear Sue, I received your letter and I'm urging you not to come. There's really no place for you near the camp. And no place in town either, except the expensive hotels. I think you should go to the farm. My folks will be happy to see you. It should be very pleasant there. It may be a little hard to get used to, but I'm sure you'll get to like it after a while. So until my next furlough, with love and kisses. Throughout the world, service to humanity is symbolized by the one banner under which all men may serve, the Red Cross. Here's a transcribed story of service to others. Service offered by the Red Cross in your name. Listen now to Tom Collins starring in our play, Personal Column. So you did come. Just as I wrote you, Steve. I'm glad you were gentleman enough to meet me at the station. I still think you should go to the farm soon. I won't be happy on a farm. Look, I bought you a ticket. I don't want it, Steve. Now look, take the ticket. My mother, my family, they're expecting you. I sent a telegram. You were coming. You might have consulted me. Take the ticket. Tell them I'm not coming. I don't want to live on a farm. I'll come in on furloughs. I waited long enough while you were overseas. No, Steve, I'm not going. Okay. Okay. If that's the way you want it, I'll rip the ticket to bits. Steve, those people are looking at us. Well, let them look. Let them all know another G.I. marriage hit the rocks. So long. Steve. Steve. And all the way back to camp, I kept thinking it over, Mr. Johnson. So I decided to come to the Red Cross office. Maybe you can help me straighten things out. Where is your wife now, Sergeant? I left her at the station. Gosh, I feel like a heel. Look, Sergeant, the first thing to do is to find your wife. Talk it over, and when you agree on what to do, maybe Red Cross can give you a little help. The first thing is to find her. But I can't leave camp. Well, I'll speak to your CO about a 24-hour leave. Oh, thanks. She's probably still waiting at the station for you. Thanks a lot, Mr. Johnson. Taxi, lady? Taxi? What did you say? You want a taxi? Taxi? Anywhere to... to a hotel. Yeah, step in, ma'am. She's about five feet three. Now, look, soldier, I sent a lot of tickets. And she's wearing a tan coat. And I see a lot of tan coats. Oh, think hard, will you? The hotter I think, the more tan coats I see. You gotta help me find her, Chief. Take it easy, Sergeant. Well, I've gotta get back to camp in 24 hours. I'll alert the patrol cars. Just let me check this description. I've got to find her. Brown hair, blue eyes, five foot three. I've only got a day. Less than a day. Take it easy. Weight 115. I blew my top. I ripped the ticket to bits. Light tan coat. A couple hours later, I come back and she's gone. Blue dress and brown sports shoes. I'll put it on teletype. Oh, Chief, you just gotta find her. No guarantees in police business, Sergeant. I, uh, I want to run this ad in the morning edition. Personal column. Very well, sir. That'll be... Let me see now. How many words? One, two, three, four, five. Dear Steve, I didn't sleep all night. I never dreamed my marriage would end this way, with me writing you a goodbye note in the hotel room. I always dreamed we'd be together. I came 600 miles to be with you, and even if I couldn't stay, you should have welcomed me with a kiss, or at the least an amiable word. All night I tossed and turned, trying to get things clear in my own mind. Now in the morning, perhaps I can tell you exactly how I feel. For three years I waited for you, hoping for you. Soldier. Hey, Sergeant, wake up. Oh, gosh. I... Must have dozed off. Mind if I sweep under this bench? Oh, go ahead. Hmm. Yeah. Didn't think I'd fall asleep. You look pretty tired, Sergeant. Yeah. Followed the streets all night. No place to sleep? I'm looking for someone. Oh. Well, you go back to sleep, soldier. I'll wake you up at train time. Oh, what train are you taking? Thanks, but I'm not taking a train. Just sleeping? No. I'm gonna keep an appointment. I hope. So long. I know your folks are very nice, but I couldn't be happy on a farm, especially with you so far away. I tried to make you see that in my letters. I came to meet you, hoping I could stay nearby and perhaps find a job. I have no place to go back to. Everything I own is in my trunk. And where I go from here is something I still have to figure out. Give me a cup of coffee. You know, always the best stories are in the personal columns. Yeah, whoever reads the front page. I do. Give me a cup of coffee. Only because you got an article once in a while that said... What do you mean once in a while? But listen to this, Pete. Give me the coffee first. Attention, Sue. I'm desperate. Got to get back to camp. We'll be at Red Cross Chapter. Please forgive me. Steve. Now, what do you make out of that? Hash. And I still want a cup of coffee. Don't it make you wonder, Pete, who is Sue and who is Steve and why is he desperate? Maybe for a cup of coffee, huh? Got to get back to camp. Look what it says. Get that paper out of my face and give me a cup of coffee. All right, all right. But you don't have to holler around here. I heard you the first time. One sugar in the coffee. Maybe this Steve, whoever the guy is, has to see this Sue, whoever the girl is. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What were those names? Steve and Sue. Give me that quick. Hey, sure, here. Not the coffee, the paper dumbbell. Make up your mind. Give me that. And who's a dumbbell? Steve. Desperate. First you holler at me for not giving you the coffee. Got to get back to camp. And then you holler at me for giving it to you. Red Cross Chapter. Steve. Hey, Pete. Where you going? Love the coffee. Keep it warm. So I lost my temper and then I lost my wife. Sit down, Sergeant. Pacing won't do any good. Well, I got six hours to go. I played a hunch and ran this ad and figured she might show up here. Well, perhaps she will. Gosh, Miss Hastings, I hope so. She used to come to see me at camp and we'd meet in the Red Cross. She's really a sweet kid, Miss Hastings. and I ran out on her. Oh, I think you and your wife might patch this up. Oh, if I'll ever find her, she'll ever talk to me again. You know, from what you've told me, maybe she just wouldn't be happy on a farm. After all, she is a trained secretary. Oh, I telegraphed my folks she was coming. You could have telegraphed them not to expect her. What, and look like a chump to my own family? Well, that's what burned me up. She just wouldn't go. If she wants to be with you, why not try to find a place near camp? Oh, I'd do anything if I could only find her. If that's what she wants, I'll look high and low. I'll walk the leather off my shoes. I'd help you to look. And so would Mr. Johnson, the Red Cross field director at camp. Oh, if I could only talk to her. Steve! Steve, old boy! Pete! Hiya, boy. So you're in again, huh? Yeah. And a sergeant. I'll put it there, Steve. Good to see you, Pete. Sergeant, I see you've got a friend. I'll say. I helped tie the knot. I was his best man. He needs a good man now. What's the deal, Steve? What's this ad I read? Sue and me, we split. She packed the trunk, she came 600 miles, and I left her flat. I've got to find her, Pete. At your service, Sergeant. I know this town like a book. You hop down to Oscar's lunchroom, my headquarters, and wait. I'm going to bring one wife. When I help tie her knot, it stays tie. You got that, Steve? Oscar's lunchroom on Fifth Street. Yeah. Yeah. Now wait there for me. Thanks a lot, Pete. Gosh, if you pull me out of this one... Can I help? This, sweetheart, is a job for a man. A man with a good pair of feet. Police precinct. No, Sergeant, no word yet. No. Four hours? I can't promise anything. Where are you now? Oscar's lunchroom. Okay. If anything turns up, I'll call you. Miss Hastings, Red Cross. Oh, no, Sergeant. She hasn't come. Three hours? Well, if she does, I'll phone immediately. Oscar's lunchroom? Yes, all right. Yeah, gonna wear out that phone, Sarge. Oh, where's Pete? He was sure he could find her. Oh, don't worry about Pete. He always gets his man. Two hours to go. But about women? Yeah, I don't know. Say, Sarge, how about a cup of coffee? Yeah. Yeah, give me a cup of coffee. Uh, you know why I never got married, Sarge? I said, uh, you know why I never got married? Hmm? No, no, why? Here's your coffee. Uh, because no woman can cook as good as me. Hey, Pete! Oh, the coffee! Why don't you look where you're going? Look at what you're thinking. Hello, Steve. Pete. You're alone. Yeah, I'm alone. With blisters on my feet. Yeah, it's brutal. You couldn't find her? Yeah, I looked in every wrinkle. She must have left town. Well, I'm going back to camp. I'm sorry, Steve. Maybe I'll hear from her. Yeah, want another cup of coffee, Sarge? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Ah, she's a sweet kid. I only wish I could just talk to her, Pete. I hope you find her. Here's your coffee, Sarge. Thanks. She came 600 miles to be with a lug like me. Hello, Sergeant. Hello, Miss Hastings. I found your wife. You did? Where? Oh, look. He's done it again. The Hotel Woodley. Hurry. She's waiting. Hotel Woodley. Gosh. Hotel Woodley. Oh, you're wonderful. You're wonderful. Never mind that now. Just hurry. Hotel Woodley. So long. Hotel Woodley, huh? Yes, that's right. I just came from there. Oh. How, um, how did you find it? Well, it was simple. The lady had a trunk. Remember? I had the station baggage master trace it to the hotel. Oh. Oh. Um, would, um, would you care perhaps to have a cup of coffee with me? Oscar makes the best coffee in town. Yeah, I sure do, ma'am. No, thank you. I've got to hurry along. Goodbye, now. Goodbye. Come again. Goodbye. Fine. Gosh, she's pretty. Give me a cup of coffee. And smart. Give me a cup of coffee. I wonder how good she can cook. Give me a cup of coffee. What's the matter? Do I have to sit up here and bale like a hound for a cup of coffee? What kind of a joint is this? All right, all right. You don't have to holler around here. All right, all right. We're going to look for a place to live. We'll find a place, Steve. Miss Hastings is going to help us. And the Red Cross field director at camp, he's going to help us, too. And maybe I can get a job and save some money. And maybe when you come out of the army, we can have a little house of our own. That's the way I dreamed it, Steve. And that's the way it's going to be, honey. You wait and see. Thank you, Tom Collins, for your splendid performance. You've just heard a story of another Red Cross service.
