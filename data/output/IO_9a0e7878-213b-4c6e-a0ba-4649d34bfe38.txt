In view of the great concern aroused by an upsurge in narcotics addiction, especially among school children, the National Broadcasting Company, in cooperation with the United Nations, brings you now as a public service a repeat broadcast of a transcribed feature about the illicit dope traffic. Narrated by Mr. Gary Cooper. United Nations Radio presents Gary Cooper with the third in a special series of dramatic case histories, Shooting Gallery. Shooting Gallery. Shooting Gallery. And to tell you this unusual true story, here is Gary Cooper. Did you ever meet a dope addict? Did you ever speak to one? Did you ever wonder how an addict feels? What he thinks? How he got that way? Well, today you're going to meet some addicts face to face. These people could have been your neighbors, an engineer, a doctor, a judge, a 59-year-old lady, a high school kid. All dope addicts. What follows isn't play acting. The people we talk about are the people you'll hear. It's the real McCoy. Shooting Gallery, according to the jargon of the underworld, is where men and women who have been hooked can get a shot of dope. But what about those desperate people who can't get the stuff? I've seen big strong men sit up and cry all night. I've seen them tear their hair. I've seen them try to cut their wrists. I've seen them take the bub out of the light and try to kill themselves with it. Ready to get the glass. Batman ought to know how it feels. For he's a drug addict himself. His story is hard to believe. You'll hear the rest of it in a moment. Narcotics in the hands of your doctor can be a blessing. But in unlicensed hands, hell on earth. The United Nations knows that in the past, trying to stop illegal drugs from getting into a country was like grabbing at a balloon. Squeeze it in one place and it pops out in another. Experience has taught us that the only way to tackle the dope racket is on a worldwide scale. And to get a complete story on narcotics today, United Nations Radio assigned Jeff Sparks to talk to everyone from government agents to U.N. scientists, from dope peddlers to their victims, and to record exactly what they said in their own words. U.N. reporter Sparks began at the end of the line. He flew down to Lexington, Kentucky, to the U.S. Public Health Service Narcotics Hospital. Down around Lexington, they call it narco. That's where an addict finally winds up, if he's lucky enough. Half of narco are federal prisoners, the other half have gone there voluntarily. But they all have one thing in common. They're trying to get off drugs and keep off. That's not as easy as it sounds. We told you, this story is hard to believe. Listen for yourself. This narcotics addict is a former criminal lawyer, a judge. I have experienced what it can do to a man. And one time I had a nice office, a nice practice. I had a happy family. I was making from $12,000 to $15,000 a year. Yeah. And I began to take a few drugs after drinking. First thing I knew, I was addicted. Did you feel the need of those drugs? Well, drugs get a hold on you. A hold on you. And it gets worse all the time. I mean, what first gave you the idea? The doctor gave them to me to get over being drunk. Oh. Now, I was a judge, and I was a successful criminal lawyer. Yeah. And I'd have a case where I'd want to sit on the bench. Yeah. And the doctor would come and give me a dose of morphine. Uh-huh. And gradually it got so that I had to have it before I could attend to my practice. I spent a whirl of money. I expect I spent $40,000 or $50,000 on morphine. Is that a fact? Yes. You're married? Married and got six children. And you just didn't realize the chance you were taking? I didn't until I was so far gone. Uh-huh. That, well, you might say I got in a position where I couldn't help myself. You mean you were just powerless to resist the urge? You just can't live without it. You're miserable. You're uncomfortable. And you eventually reach a state where it don't bring you quite up to normal. Your mind don't function. Yeah. You can't think in the courtroom. You're depressed. And, of course, all your clients see that. The public sees that. Yeah. And it just simply destroys you. Yeah. That's the way it is with dope. It's no respecter of rank or position or brain. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are. What country, what town or city or what side of the tracks you live on. How do everyday people come to this? Why do they do it? Here are some answers from addicts themselves. I was working on the railroad at the time and I met some fellas that used it. Finally coached me to take a shot. They said it would give you a good boot. It was just that I was extremely nervous, emotionally upset. Well, it was through ill health. Got addicted by kidney stones. Yes, sir. It relieved the pain. After they got the stones out, I had something worse than a kidney stone. A narcotic habit. Unfortunately, I've been an addict all my life. I was only a kid. I'm an old lady now. I'm 59. I was on drugs before I was old enough to attend school. There are many reasons given by the patients for being hooked on drugs. What does their medical director, Dr. Victor Vogel, think? Well, the answer, of course, depends on a thorough knowledge of what makes the man tick. We've got to help the man understand why he wanted to take drugs. In most cases, it depends on helping the man to an understanding of some emotional or psychiatric difficulty. We find in the great majority of our histories of patients here that they became addicts from association with others who were addicts. Narcotic addiction is a communicable disease just as truly almost as typhoid fever or diphtheria or smallpox. So, narcotics addiction is a contagious disease. It affects all countries regardless of boundaries. Since all the deals between the peddlers and the users are secret, there's no way of estimating the dollars, pesos, pounds, or yen of stuff that's sold each day. And all that means quick profits for the peddler and a sure market, a soft racket. But there's always the risk of being caught. That's why prices are high. For example, the legal price for an ounce of morphine is $15. The peddler's price, $2,000. It isn't often that we get the lowdown from the peddler himself, as our UN reporter did. Were you pretty sick when you came in? I wasn't sick. Well, how'd you get here? I was brought here by two marshals. How did you come into contact with narcotics? I was selling narcotics. Yeah. How did you take it up? Well, just the idea of making money, that's all. What'd you think? There was an easy way of getting some money? I did at first, but now I see it's not. Not so good. That's right. Well, did you realize at the very beginning what effect it would have on other people who were using it? No, I didn't. You were just interested in the commercial aspects of it, huh? That's right. Pete the peddler was anxious to sell, to make a fast dollar. The addict is even more anxious to buy the drug. That's one of the great handicaps in drying up the illicit dope racket. The smuggler, the peddler, the customer. Each protects the other, and all three protect the shooting gallery, the place where you get the shot of dope. Shooting gallery is just one expression in the narcotics underworld dictionary. There are a lot more. We asked Elliot about it. Elliot is 62. He's been doing time since 1926. Elliot, tell me. I heard somebody use the expression around here, artillery. Does that mean anything? That is a hypodermic spoon and what it takes to use a shot. What other words can you think of? Well, if a guy's going out, he says, well, where can I score? He means, where can he find stuff? Is there a connection around here? Oh. That means, is there some guy selling stuff? Well, if he's no connection, where can I make a croaker? A croaker? Well, if you find a doctor, it'll take care of him. Is that what they call doctors? Yeah. What do they call morphine? They call it smack. If a man is going to be using cocaine, how would he refer to cocaine? Well, you say happy dust, probably. Happy dust. Now, what do they call the fellow who's the brains behind the narcotics ring? They call the real people and that they used to do the importing, the syndicate. The syndicate? Yeah. Uh-huh. That was the first man that got the stuff when he came off the boat. Now, what do they call a federal narcotics agent? Well, uh, uncle. Supposing a man wants to say to you, I'm taking dope. How does he say it? Well, he says, I'm on stuff. I'm on stuff. Another guy said, well, what are you doing? You using any junk there? Sure, I'm using stuff. Not a pretty picture. Seeing a man of 62 with a wasted life. Just another case of a fellow who never had a chance. That's what you're probably thinking. The fact is that Elliot, the dope addict, is a graduate electrical engineer. It's bad enough when a grown person is on the stuff. But what of a child addict? Hooking a youngster. As UN reporter Sparks made his way from one end of narco to the other, he saw a young boy enter. Carrying his suitcase. Sparks set up his portable microphone and secured what is probably the only actuality tape recording ever made of a teenager being admitted for narcotics treatment. Dr. Vogel, what would you call this? The admissions office? This is the admissions unit, yes. I said, do you mind if I, uh, sort of eavesdrop on the gentleman who is admitting this man here? Not at all, providing his identity is not revealed. All right, then. Now, we'll write down here the amount that you have remaining, which is $3.50, which will be properly deposited. Uh, excuse me, what is your name? Shurik. And you're a member of the U.S. Public Health Service? That's right. If you don't mind, I'd like you to stay by here and, uh, eavesdrop. Very well. Yeah, what is your work? I was going to school. How old are you? I'm 18. You're 18. Well, how long have you been on drugs? Well, approximately about a year and a half or something. About a year and a half. Well, how, uh, I suppose. Well, how'd you start it? Just curiosity. Uh-huh. You, uh, you thought that you were going to get a big bang out of it, huh? Well, yeah, in a way. And what else did you expect? I didn't know what to expect. That's why I was curious. I guess curiosity makes a lot of people do different things. Well, what did you try first? Morphine or heroin or cocaine or marijuana? What was it? Well, heroin. Heroin. You had to buy it? Yes, it wasn't given to me. Yes, I had to buy it. Well, where'd you buy it? You don't have to tell me exactly where, but I mean, from a peddler or from, uh, uh... I guess you would call it a peddler. I mean, you had to find him. If you were curious, I guess you'd find some sort of way to find a person like that. I see. How long were you on it? About, well, I'd been on it about two years. In other words, you really started using it when you were about 16. At the end of 15, going into 16, yeah. What would you tell any of your friends who were your age about, uh, about the stuff? Who haven't tried it yet? What would you tell them? Well, I'd probably say that it leads to nothing, you know. From what I have experienced, it didn't do me any good. Uh, you go right ahead with your processing there. I'm sorry to have interrupted. That's all right. Are both of your parents living at this time? Yes. And the extent of your education to date? The senior year of high school. Completed the senior year of high school? No, I didn't complete it. This boy is now entering a new world of hope. His first step at Narco is the most important. It's called withdrawal. The hospital's director, Dr. Vogel, tells us just what that means. A withdrawal, uh, refers to the, uh, period during which patients are removed from the drug, or to put it the other way, the drug's removed from the patient. Withdrawal may be accomplished, uh, abruptly, or as the patients call it, cold turkey. Most, uh, withdrawals these days are tapering or gradually diminishing withdrawals, in which the drug is gradually reduced over a period of, uh, five to thirty days, depending on the practice in the, uh, particular hospital. Here, our practice is to substitute a different narcotic drug. It's a synthetic drug. This drug is substituted for morphine or heroin, which is usually being taken on the outside, because withdrawal from the substituted drug methadone is less uncomfortable than from morphine or heroin. We feel it's inhumane, uh, and causes needless suffering to patients who've been taking large amounts of drugs off abruptly. Experts will tell you that addiction begins in the mind, whether the victim is a thrill seeker or is trying to avoid facing a problem. And that is why it is so important to root out depression, anxiety, and put in its place constructive, creative things. These give the mind satisfactions far beyond the fraudulent power of drugs. At Narco, you can see the wonders accomplished through occupational therapy, in the cabinet-making shops, the farm, the dairy, the gardens, the studio. Here, finding new interests, are men and women whose only previous concern in life had been a hypodermic of dope. Like this elderly lady with a talent she's just discovered. Painting. Painting. Here.
