The Municipal Broadcasting System presents Freedom's Ladder Freedom's Ladder with radio star Monica Lewis, piano favorite Melba Pope, and your genial master of ceremonies, the Amsterdam news columnist Bill Chase. How do you do? Greetings, salutations, a fun cheerio, and welcome once more to Freedom's Ladder, which is just an intimate program of music, a bit of chit-chat, and this and that, just to remind you that freedom is more than a mere word. The curtain rises now, and our cheerful little earful, and here is our own little teeny-weeny, lovable Melba Pope, of whom there is no humor on the 88, and the number is Embraceable You. The Minute The predetermined Foley From theヤ That's a fan of theraham przykład The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End In your arms The End The End The End The End In your formula Do you have any set practice of big names or do you use talent if it's unusual talent? Well, my program's only been on six or seven weeks and for the first few weeks we have tried to stick to names if possible. I don't say just the biggest names. I mean, we've used up-and-coming artists like Bobby Doyle. That's right. I remember. And Bobby is a signature artist. He records on signature. I record for signature, too. Good. Why not put in a plug? It's free. So, we use Bobby. And, of course, he did have his own show for a while for every shot. But, I mean, compared to names like Lionel Hampton, Stan Kenton, Bobby's a newcomer. He's a youngster. Wonderful. Why don't you have this new guy on, Mel Tomei. I've heard an awful lot about him. Yes, well, yes, he's a very good singer. We, as a matter of fact, I was at a celebrity party thrown for him by Art Ford on the Milkman's matinee. Oh, great. Yes, I heard about that one. Yes, it was a lot of fun. Well, I think you've got a wonderful future in radio. And not only that, but I think you could do very well on the stage and a musical comedy, perhaps. Well, thank you. I hope to do something on Broadway. I've been hoping for a long time, but I haven't had the time or the energy to get around to really doing much about it. Well, you will. And the movies, how about that? You'd be wonderful in the movies. Why, thank you. You should see her. She's very cute, very petite, very blonde, very charming. Gee, you've got everything that's going to stop you. Well, I like to do movies, too. But, I mean, it takes a long time unless you just want to be a flash-in-the-pan artist. I mean, I'd rather establish myself first as a good singer, and that takes a long time. Yes, but you don't want to wait too long before you get too old. Well, really, I don't have that to worry about yet, Jack. Let's face it. Well, would you like to tell us how old you are or is it a secret? Well, the truth of the matter is I'm 21, but we say I'm 20. Wonderful. A mere babe in the woods. Well, do you think we might have another number now because we've got lots of time, and I think the people would like to hear you sometime? Fine, okay, sure. What will it be this time? This one's a sort of a sultry ballad, I'm in the mood for love. Oh, well, now that's, you've got something there. I'm in the mood for love. Thank you very much. I'm in the mood for love Simply because you're near me Funny, but when you're near me I'm in the mood for love I'm in the mood for love Heaven is in your eyes Bright as the stars were under So is it any wonder I'm in the mood for love I'm in the mood for love Why stop to think of weather A little dream might fade A little dream might fade We'll put our hearts together If there's a cloud up above If there's a cloud up above If it should rain, well let it If it should rain, well let it But for tonight, forget it Forget it Forget it Forget it Forget it I'm in the mood for love Oh, thank you very much, Monica And the way you sang that I really believe that That's right, you didn't tell us Anything about your husband And I have heard that you're married Right? Tell us something about him That's right, well I'm married A little over a year To a young chap named Bob Thiel Everybody's young these days but me Why aren't you young? You look young No more Well, Bob is the youngest president I would say of a record company in the country He's 24 24 and president of a record company Yeah Not signature records Yes, signature Thank you, you got me a job Well, I don't know I don't have much pull around there I really don't All I do is work Well, that's wonderful You look so radiant today Do you perhaps have one little reason Any special reason? Yeah, that gleam in your eye and whatnot Well, yes, I really have After a year of living from pillar to post And in and out of every hotel in town We finally found an apartment And it's such a pleasure to walk from one room to another Oh, that is swell I know exactly how you feel Because the only apartment I've had in the last few years was in the army Oh, great And I had to share it with something like 59 other guys Well, Monica, it's been awfully nice having you down today Well, thank you, Joe And if you're not too busy, we'd like to have you back again very soon Well, I certainly hope to come back soon Thank you an awful lot Round back to Melba Pope now Who is willing and ready and able again I think I've used that expression before A little cliché Well, anywho Melba's going to play for us now These foolish things And I'm sure she doesn't have me in mind Here is the we sneak up They have to go on As you talk to them They have to come and get ready No one more quite Anyhow How about that? Before they begin and kind this film Well, time is fast running out, and so we must say goodnight to you one and all.
