What for? I've got no harm on the door I've got no love on the door That's the way to be They can steal the rug from the floor That's okay to be For the things that are tied like the stars In the skies are all free Oh, I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I've got my gal, got my song Her head is a whole day long Do you complain it? Got my gal, got my gal Got my gal, got my love Got my love, got my song I've got plenty of nothing And nothing's plenty for me I can't go sun, can't go moon Can't go deep to sea The folks with plenty of money Got to pray all the day He's with plenty He's with plenty He's with plenty He's with plenty Away, away, away I am a friend of hell In a time to cry Never worry long And I'm well Never want to strive To be good, to be bad What the hell Are you glad I'm a boy?
