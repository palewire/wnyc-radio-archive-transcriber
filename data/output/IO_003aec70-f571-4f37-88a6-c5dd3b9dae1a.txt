Mail come, mail come Fresh from the good cows to you Dolph, hey Dolph, wait Oh boy Hi Tim Hey, how's the newspaper going? Fine See, you have a new cart It's a beauty Say, did you hear about the ruckus over in the fields last night? Did I? Mr. Holt, our new editor, holed me out before daylight to set type on the story Clam-o, clam-o Yeah, look who's coming Clam-o, clam-o, morning's fresh clams, fine clams Hi, hey, that voice of yours will raise the dead Well, Jack, how's business? Fine, fine Tim and I were just talking about it last night The Redcoats tried to cut down another flagpole belonging to the Sons of Liberty Yes, and if Captain Sears of the Liberty Boys hadn't arrived in the nick of time to quiet things There would have been serious trouble Gee, I'd like to join Captain Sears in the liberties And if the soldiers cut this pole down, that'll make the fort All right, there's trouble all over the city Did you hear about the lieutenant from the Man of War, Hussar? No, what happened? He came ashore looking for trouble, wearing a big seal-skin hat Somebody threw him a fish Now, wasn't that rude? It was, but he started caning the only person he could catch, a little kid Well, if I'd have been there, that wouldn't have happened Then some of the big boys stepped up The lieutenant called to several Navy seamen for help And then things got pretty rough It's a good thing Mr. Isaac Roosevelt was at the hand-in-hand firehouse nearby He had the lieutenant arrested for starting a riot And locked him up for safekeeping What's going to come of all this? Yes, I thought when the king repealed the Stamp Act, our troubles were over Now the new tax laws are worse Times certainly are terrible Don't you complain Selling milk or clams and I guess working on a printing press Are a whole lot more prosperous than most other business Shipping is at a standstill Half the city is idle And it'll get worse I don't see how Well, the New York merchants are not going to ship out any goods Until they get fair treatment Oh, what will they do? Only yesterday, a group of merchants John Kruger, Mr. Roosevelt, Captain Sears, and William Walton Came in to get Mr. Holt to support them in organizing a chamber of commerce What would that be? That would be an association of the leading merchants And what would they do? They'd do anything they could to improve commerce And would stand for pure products Full weights and fair trade But most of all, right now as I understand it They'd clamp down on the selling of all imports from England Until the king comes to his senses No tax repeal, no trade Well, Dolphin boy, no more water in the milk And Jack, you'd have to dig honest clams I guess we all better get back to work See you again Bye, boys Get in Milk, fresh milk Milk Just as Tim said A group of New York's most distinguished merchants Made their way to the tavern of Messrs Bolton and Sigal In Lower Broad Street on April 15, 1768 This inn, then known as the Queen's Head Is of special interest to us Because during the Revolutionary War It became France's tavern And to this day we can see the long room there Where the Chamber of Commerce was founded And where later George Washington was entertained Mr. John Kruger, the sugar merchant Was quickly elected the first president The men agreed to stop trading in tax goods Until justice prevailed Captain Sears addressed the gathering The people would never stand for compromises now As long as we have ever-growing numbers Of the King's soldiers quartered here And are taxed for their support There can be only one path the people will follow And that I fear will be a bold one Gentlemen, there are grave days ahead And so it went It seemed a paradox that the Chamber Dedicated as it was to the laudable purpose Of promoting trade and commerce Had to start its career by the restriction Of a large volume of trade Many meetings were held Many fine standards were set Local business improved But the political troubles in the city Simmered hotter and hotter Until one day The following incident took place Look, Dolph Down by the market house Soldiers in a big crowd The redcoats are trying to put up a sign of some kind Here comes Jack Come on, Jack Grab a barrel stave That sign's an insult Lobster backs Go back to your kennels Go home and let honest folks be Yeah, let's dust them off with these staves Hey, stand back there For the King's soldiers Diddy rabble Rabble is it We'll show you British thieves Beggars Here comes Captain Sears and the magistrate What's the trouble here? Quiet! Corporal Why are you here? We were just coming to market It's a lie They're looking for trouble Look at the sign, Captain It's an insult Well now, Tim Let's see I wouldn't call this a love note Would you, magistrate? As magistrate of the city, corporal I order you to take your sign And return to your barracks I'm one of you Since when do the King's soldiers Take abuse from rebellious dogs? You've been arrogant enough Now be gone Don't The soldier's drawing his bayonet Watch yourself, Captain The bayonet Did you see that doll? The captain knocked him cold With a ram's horn Well, the fat's on the fire now Let's charge them Look out for those bayonets Here come some sailors And they're drawing their cutlasses Come on, men They can't stop us When order was finally restored On that fateful day Some of the soldiers And several citizens Were wounded And a sailor was killed This has been called The first bloodshed Of the Revolutionary War It was known as The Battle of Golden Hill From the name of the hill Leading from the market house On the East River In the vicinity of John Street and Maiden Lane From that time on Isaac Sears And other members Of the Chamber of Commerce Were forced more and more Into the fortunes of war After the formal outbreak Of the Revolution And during the occupation Of New York By British troops The Chamber of Commerce The Chamber continued to function Only intermittently With the few members Remaining loyal to the King The struggles, privations And final victory Of the Revolution Are well known And the new nation Was formed But Immediately after The glorious evacuation day Of November 25th, 1783 When the British troops Boarded their ships And departed The Chamber of Commerce Of the State of New York Was reformed Under state charter Its first post-war president Was the heroic And honorable Isaac Sears Down through the years New York's Chamber of Commerce Has contributed more Than any other public group To the business And commercial success Of New York The Queen of Commerce You have heard Another transcribed episode Of New York Queen of Commerce Today Commerce organizes In Francis Tavern In today's cast Were Lloyd Moss As the narrator Mark Gordon As Tim Arthur Seelan As Dolph Alan Feinstein As Jack And Alfred Israel As Sears Music and sound Were by Marvin Laskowitz Production assistant Was Helen Milstead New York Queen of Commerce Was written by Kenneth H.
