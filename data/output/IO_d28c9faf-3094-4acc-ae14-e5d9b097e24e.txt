Ladies and gentlemen, in the spirit of worship, when man pauses among the many cares of life to give reverent attention to his God and creator, we come now to a divine service conducted each Sunday morning at this hour for the thousands of prisoners who are assembled over the country in prison chapels in the various penal institutions. The Volunteers of America, the Pioneer Prison Welfare Organization, has labored for a half century inside the gray walls of every state prison in America. Firm believers in the theory that there is no worthwhile prison reform program that does not seek to change the human heart, they are constantly found within the shadows of life's other side, holding up the day star of hope to men and women who have long since lost hope. This morning, our service is conducted by Major and Mrs. Walter O. Ulrey, outstanding prison workers, who greet you from Washington, D.C., in the heart of the nation's capital, in a service especially dedicated to the men incarcerated in the Maryland State Penitentiary, located at Baltimore, Maryland, of which the Reverend A. N. Blombau is chaplain. Mrs. Ulrey, whose voice has inspired thousands of prisoners in many states to a better life, begins our service singing a beautiful old hymn, When I Get to the End of the Way. The sands have been washed in the footprints of a stranger on the gallery's shoe, And the boys that set to the rock below, will be fired in Judea no more. But the path of the throne gallows the earth, With joy I will follow today, And the trials of the road will seem nothing, When I get to the end of the way. When I get to the end of the way. The sands have been washed in the woods, When I get to the end of the way. I live in the woods, I live in the woods, In the woods, I live in the woods, And there are so many fields, To climb upon, High open and longing for rest, The table points me, My path of grace, And there are so many fields, To climb upon, High open and longing for rest, The table points me, I know it is what he has promised That my strength it shall be as my day Them trials of rude will seem nothing When I get to the end of the day Them trials of rude will seem nothing When I get to the end of my way One of the greatest joys of our work Is in being able to give a Bible to every man in prison who asks for one We have a need and could use right now 5,000 Bibles Which we could place in the hands of Bible reading men and women Behind prison walls So we're appealing to Christian people who want to do something for God To send us one or more good new Bibles Because there's a steady, constant demand and need For Bibles and God's Word inside the walls Help us to fill this need And I'm sure God will bless you Mail them to me Major Ulrey Post Office Box 6-9 Washington, D.C. And now Mrs. Ulrey sings one of the real old favorites of the church How tedious and how tasteless the hours How tedious and tasteless the hours When Jesus no longer I see Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flowers Have all lost their sweetness to me The midst of the sunshine but dim The fields driving me to gain But when I am happy with him He shall fall as pleasant as may Now for our morning prayer And I'd be so glad if every one of you men would stand And bow your head and close your eyes As I lead you to the throne in grace O God, our Heavenly Father Just now all around us there are heavy hearts In sin and in bondage Physical bondage Men are downhearted and discouraged Many of them have long since lost hope We pray for the blessed presence of the Holy Spirit in this service That some poor penitent boy might find the blessed joy Of an experience of sins forgiven Thou canst break asunder the shackles that bind men's hearts Thou canst set the prisoner free This morning we pray that you would speak to every listener Bless all those who have asked us to pray for them The sick and the needy And all those men and women in prison with the special problems May we say something this hour That might cause some poor unbelieving soul to turn To the only one who can roll away the burden And bring them out into the marvelous sunlight of God's love Bless all the boys there in the Maryland State Prison at Baltimore As we worship together this morning May it be with a very conscious realization That thou art in our midst We ask it in the name of our Redeemer Who hung on Calvary to save us Amen This morning in our lesson I want to call your attention To the 23rd verse of the 32nd chapter of Numbers Be sure your sin will find you out But for the benefit of you men here before me this morning It could just as well read Numbers 32-23 Be sure your chickens will come home to ruse Let me tell you a little Bible story That happened way back there After Joshua had taken the leadership of Israel After the death of Moses You'll remember that to him fell the great task Of driving the heathen from the country So that God's people could go in And occupy the promised land God led the hosts of Israel And time after time To the amazement of the heathen Who possessed far greater forces They went down in defeat and death So the boldness and the confidence Of the Israelites grew with leaps and bounds Here we have the main army of Israel Camped out for the night And over there just a few miles Was a little village of heathen Too small and too insignificant to mention So Joshua sends just a small force To conquer it without delay Imagine his chagrin Embarrassment and shame To receive the report the following day That the force Heretofore victorious Heretofore victorious Had been terribly beaten And madly had flown for their very lives This was a direct contradiction Of what the angel of God Had promised Joshua When he assumed command over Israel So down on his knees Goes Joshua to find out What was the trouble And God revealed the terrible truth That sin had entered into the Israelitish camp Which caused the defeat And that before victory should ever come again That sin must be removed So Joshua numbered the tribes and the leaders With great inquiry and diligence And one man named Achan Finally confessed That in taking a city In a former battle He could not resist Stealing a little gold And a few changes Of beautiful garments Instead of destroying all of them As God had commanded And Achan buried the treasure Beneath the floor of his tent And there it was found No doubt in the darkness of night He hid the gold So that no eye would see But God's eye was upon him And because of his sin Israel suffered defeat and shame Joshua dealt with Achan As God commanded The sin was blotted out Along with all of Achan's household And Israel marched on to victory Be sure your sin will find you out I knew a man several years ago Who had a lovely wife and a home But he was a sinner He had had the light of the gospel But of it he had made a mockery I watched him go down and down He broke up another man's home And he orphaned several little children To him it was just all a joke He was going to have a good time With utter disregard He time after time Violated nature's law God's law And man's law Until at last A dreadful disease took hold of him And I remember his whining Begging for sympathy As they carted him off to the hospital A broken, diseased old man Forsaken of God And rejected of man His chickens had finally come home to ruse His sin had finally caught up with him There are tens of thousands of persons this morning Under the sound of my voice Who have sins that they think are covered They have gone to great lengths Of time and money So that their sins won't be found out and exposed That the day of reckoning will never come But God says differently Be sure your sins Will find you out When you least expect it And at a time when you're least able to stand it Those old chickens will come home to root It's the law of God That if you sow wild oats You'll surely reap a harvest And if you sow to the wind You'll reap the whirlwind God is not mocked Whatsoever we soweth That also shall we reap Ladies and gentlemen In the spirit of worship When man pauses among the many cares of life To give reverent attention to his
