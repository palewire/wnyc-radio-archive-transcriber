Over NBC's coast-to-coast network of independent affiliated stations, the University of Chicago Roundtable. Today the Roundtable discusses what is the basic conflict between the United States and Russia. Taking part in this program are Hans J. Morgenthau, director of the Center for the Study of American Foreign Policy, and Louis Wirth, sociologist, both of the University of Chicago. Now to open today's Roundtable, Mr. Wirth. Morgenthau, I want to take this opportunity to welcome you back to the campus after three and a half months in Europe. The main topic of conversation of the American people since you have been away, as you probably have heard, is the question, are we headed for a world war? Wirth, I can assure you, that this same question has been asked of me by scores of Europeans, too. It's a main topic of conversation in Europe, too. After four weeks of congressional hearings around this question, the issues are more obscure than they even were before. And an effective foreign policy, as we all know, depends upon a clear understanding of the issues involved. Now, before you left for Europe, you published an article called The Real Issue Between the United States and Russia, which you have since expanded into your book called In Defense of the National Interest. Let's examine these issues. First, before we examine these issues, we must be clear in our minds about the revolutionary changes which have occurred in the last 50 years in the world, and of which the real issue between the United States and the Soviet Union is a mere reflection. There have been three great revolutions which have transformed our world almost beyond recognition. A political revolution, a technological revolution, a moral revolution. The political revolution has destroyed forever the Western state system as it has existed since the end of the Middle Ages, the world, and the world. The world is composed, as it was, of a number of nations of approximately equal strength. Instead, we have now two superpowers, toward which all the important strength, political and military and economic, flows. And we have a great number of secondary nations, of nations of third and fourth and fifth rank, which neither alone nor in combination can hold their own against those two superpowers. Under those circumstances, Morgenthau, an armed conflict between these two great powers no longer can have limited objectives. It means either the conquest of the world by one or the other, or the mutual destruction of both. This is indeed so, and it has come about primarily because of the second revolution, the technological one. The technological revolution has almost eliminated the element of time and space on our globe. It takes today less time to circle the globe than it took 150 years ago to travel from Washington to New York. And this means that world conquest by one power is now possible. One power can conquer the world and hold it. In this shrunken universe, therefore, we must have some kind of an answer to the breakdown of the state system. Now, this possibility of world conquest is greatly enhanced by the third revolution, the moral revolution. For today, we do no longer have the mere conflict between two or more nations for limited advantage, be it a frontier, a town, a province, a succession to a throne, and the like. It so happens that the two great power centers, Washington and Moscow, are also the seeds of two antagonistic and incompatible philosophies of life. One of which, the one in Moscow, has become a real political religion, that is to say, a system of thought, which promises salvation to all mankind here and now, and which tries to remake the world in its own image. This means that the world is no longer governed by a single moral code. And the moral differences are also coupled with great armed powers, which can carry these moral principles into action. In other words, there is a great danger, that the political conflicts of today will become tomorrow political and military crusades, destroying all of our civilization. Now, in view of this situation, Morgenthau, what is the specific set of problems with regard to the United States foreign policy, when we see these three great revolutions culminating in the building up of the United States as one great power, and the Soviet Union as the other great power? In other words, what is the real issue between the United States and the Soviet Union, with which American foreign policy must deal? In other words, there are three possible explanations of that real issue. And I should say right away that I share neither the first nor the second of those explanations. The first is that really there is no real problem separating the United States and the Soviet Union. It is all a matter of suspicion, of misunderstanding, of mistrust, of a cultural and economic gap. And if we could only bridge that gap by lending the Soviet Union money, by raising its living standards, everything would be all right. In other words, you are saying that this innocuous way of looking at this situation consists in believing that mutual suspicion can be eradicated by mutual friendship, and mutual differences can be eradicated by equalizing the opportunities and resources of the two great powers. Yes. And that this is an illusion. Sure, it is an illusion which I think fortunately is no longer held by many among us today. But you will certainly remember that a couple of years ago there were quite a number of innocent and not so innocent people among us who propagated this false interpretation of the real issue. Now what is the alternative, the second conception that you think is mistaken? The second conception is still widely held in our midst. And it starts with the assumption that the Soviet Union is irrevocably committed to world revolution. And that therefore the conflict cannot be resolved peacefully and must be resolved by war. In other words, that you have these two great power centers with a philosophy, with a political religion, coupled with force and using all the means of conquering or subduing one another, including treason, which makes war inevitable. Each of these two powers has a claim to a monopolistic religion and wishes to impose it upon the rest of the world. In practical terms that means the United States is engaged in a crusade. And that the real issue is world revolution. But isn't this precisely what MacArthur has been saying, that this is a crusade against communism? This is indeed true. And I think those commentators have done a disservice to the American people who have tried to minimize the profound difference of opinion which exists between MacArthur and the Truman administration. For MacArthur, the conflict is a conflict between two different political philosophies. His enemy is communism everywhere in the world. For the Truman administration, I think it is something quite different. And your conviction is that the Truman administration's point of view is the sound one in this case? Indeed. Now, since you reject these two views of the situation, there remains the third one. This one, as I have seen in your book, you state as the issue of Russian imperialism. Would you comment on that? It seems to me that what confronts us today is exactly the same thing that confronted Great Britain at the turn of the 18th century in the form of the French Revolution. That is to say, we are dealing here with a traditional imperialism, pursuing traditional ends with partly novel means. That is to say, Stalin pursues exactly the same objectives which the Tsars since Peter the Great have pursued before. The domination of Eastern Europe, the domination of as much as possible of Central and Western Europe, the acquisition of warm water ports all around the world, consolidation of Russian power in Asia, and so forth. And Stalin pursues those traditional objectives, in part with the traditional methods of military power, in part, however, with the novel methods of subversion with columns and instigation of revolution. Now, in what sense is this imperialistic diagnosis that you make comparable to what has happened in the world before? After all, there have been other imperialisms in the world. How have they been restrained? They have been restrained by two things. By military force and by accommodating diplomacy. That is to say, military force has served to protect the vital interests of the nation, threatened by imperialism. And diplomacy has served to arrive at a negotiated settlement through compromise concerning the secondary issues dividing nations. In other words, in other words, in other words, in other words, that in this case, we are certainly subject to great danger, that is, our security is threatened, because in part, Stalin might attempt to conquer the world under the guise of liberating the world. Indeed, exactly as revolutionary France did 150 years ago. And in the case of the revolutionary France, it was England, primarily, that was threatened, or felt itself threatened. Yes, and I should perhaps add here, perhaps those three alternatives of interpreting the real issue were then presented in a most profound and impressive way by three of the greatest statesmen which Great Britain has produced. M. Spock, which, again, was the only entrusted and refined in some several, most generals, Coordinator, while they were yesterday, in all walkers were now in the church house. M.

Kavard, character of French was made strong members of the Russian steeds power to run the work lost by Hong Kong, What evidence is there, Morgan Powell, that this is the correct analysis of the tension between the United States and Russia? To me, the evidence is overwhelming. The history of Russian foreign policy, certainly since the accession of Spearley, that the Soviet Union has always subordinated the objective of world revolution to the protection and promotion of the traditional national interests of Russia. In other words, Stalin has always given up world revolution when it seems to get into the way of Russian security and Russian imperialism. In other words, they have advanced when it was to their advantage as an imperial power, and they retreated when it was necessary. Indeed. Now, if we accept this third explanation as the source of the real conflict between the United States and Russia, then we still must recognize that our security is very much at stake. As indeed it is. I might perhaps quote here the words which William Pitt used in the year 1800 when in the House of Commons a membox asked him, What are we fighting for? Well, Pitt said, I will tell the Honourable Gentleman what we are fighting for in one word. The issue at stake is, and I quote, Security against a danger, the greatest that ever threatens the world. And I think this is the issue which faces us today. Now, in your article and in your book to which I have referred, you point out that the situation in Europe is fundamentally different from the situation in Asia. You point out that in Asia there is a revolution going on, a revolution from a primitive way of life to a modern way of life, a revolution from colonialism to independence. Now, do the same policies apply to Europe that apply to Asia? They certainly do not. What faces us in Europe is military conquest and not genuine revolution. We should not forget that in no country of Europe which was not conquered by the Red Army has a communist revolution been successful. And in those countries in which a so-called communist revolution was successful, it was really the mere by-product of conquest by the Red Army for the purposes of strengthening and perpetuating that conquest. In Asia, on the other hand, you have genuine revolution. You would have revolution in Asia even though Bolshevism had never been heard of. In other words, it is an oversimplification. And it is more than that. It is a complete distortion of the situation to attribute the revolutions of Asia to the imaginations of the Gremlin and nothing else. In other words, the implication for our foreign policy with reference to Asia is that we should attempt to guide the revolution into constructive channels that are compatible with our own national interests and our own national ideas. And furthermore, it is futile to try to oppose a revolutionary movement supported by about a billion people with military force. I take it also, Morgenthau, that you believe that regardless of what Russian imperialism in Asia might do, it does not present anything that is a direct danger to us or that we can do very much about it except to counter it by a constructive program. Yes, I certainly agree with that. Now, does this mean that we should center our actions on Europe? Well, I think the question as to what should have precedence in our actions, Europe or Asia, is wrongly put. I am neither an Asia-first nor a Europe-first. I think in both cases we are dealing with very vital problems for the United States. But the methods we must use must be adapted to the problems we are facing. And as we are in agreement, the problems are entirely different in Europe and in Asia. In Europe, we must use primarily military force and diplomacy. In Asia, we must use primarily that reservoir of ideas and ideals which have given us the friendship of the Asiatic peoples in the past and the neglect of which has lost us much of the friendship of those peoples in the recent past. Morgenthau, are we wise? Are we practical in attempting to rearm Europe and sending our own military forces there? Are we wise in mobilizing U.S. strength to aid to these other countries and building up our own military machine? In other words, can these countries do anything to defend Europe? First of all, I think we must establish certain priorities. And I think the first priority is to be given to American rearmament. For it has been in the past the strength of the United States, the actual and potential, which has restrained the Soviet Union. What has defended Berlin in 1949 has not been the two divisions of American troops stationed in Western Europe. It has been the total of American power in the Western Hemisphere which has defended it. But you know that General Eisenhower has been in Europe for quite a time, building up, conferring the armed forces of Europe. We have been sending our own divisions over there. What are the ends of that action? Is it to defend Europe against Russian aggression? Can we hold a line in Europe? Or is it to deter the Russians and to contain them? I do not think that you can hold, under present or foreseeable circumstances, any particular line in Europe, be it the Rhine, be it the Elbe, be it the Pyrenees. You can only deter the Russians from marching. Once they march, you might perhaps be able to hold a couple of beachheads. But I think it is a mere illusion to think that with the Europeans or without the Europeans, you can hold any particular line in Europe. And here is the problem of European morale that comes in. I think you cannot convince, with all kinds of propaganda you may want to use, any European, that he has any chance of fighting the Russian armies poised at the Elbe and save a Western civilization. For even if you were able to hold a line at any particular point in Europe, one thing is sure, the cities of Europe, the European way of life, European civilization, would be destroyed in the process. And every European knows that in his bones. What do you think, then, Morgenthal, has stopped the Russians so far from moving into Europe? As I have tried to point out before, what has stopped them is one thing alone, the power of retaliation of the United States. And the presence of American divisions in Europe can only have one function, and that is this, to make it crystal clear to the Russians that any attack upon Western Europe means an attack upon the United States. that there can be absolutely no doubt in the minds of the Russian leaders that war against any country of Western Europe means war against the United States. And I should add that the Russian leaders have no doubt on that crown, and it is for this reason that they haven't marched. Have you gathered any impressions as to how the Europeans themselves feel about their own rearming, or about the Russian-American conflict? Do they believe that we are provoking the conflict, or we are mitigating the conflict? Well, this is a difficult question to answer. I would say that there are three basic emotions present in the minds of those Europeans to whom I have talked. The first, the fear of war. Four, a one lesson has been brought home to all Europeans, and more particularly to the Germans, that another world war means the destruction of their civilization. And I take it they don't want to be liberated again? Indeed not. The second emotion is fear of American isolationism. They are greatly, and as I of course have tried to tell them, a quite wrongly afraid of a revival of the isolationism of the 20s and the 30s. And the third emotion, quite contradictory to the second one, is the fear that the United States will bring about that very conflict, which we all want to avoid. Do you agree that the central problem in Europe is the disposition in the future of Germany? Indeed it is. What impressions have you gathered on that? Well I must say, I have been rather disheartened by my experiences in Germany. And I think the measure of the hopelessness of the situation, from the point of view of democracy, is the despair of those Germans who are real Democrats. Are there any such? There are certainly such. I'll give you an example. I have talked to a number of people who were the relatives and the associates of the group who made the putsch against Hitler of June 1944. Now those people have told me how mortally afraid they are for their lives in case the American occupation should end. For they and their executed relatives and friends are now regarded by broad masses of the German people as traitors to the cause of Germany. A new legend of the stub of the back is making its rounds in Germany. That is to say, Germany would have won the war had it not been for the treachery of the generals and aristocrats of June 1944. There are three questions I want to ask you briefly, Morgenthal. Supposing that we do mobilize as we are doing, mobilize our economic and moral strength and arm the Europeans, would Russia stand by for two or three years with folded arms until we are ready before she strikes? Well, this is a question that perhaps even Stalin is unable to answer. I would go so far as to say that there is a very fine line which divides deterrent power from provocative power and a very wise statesmanship is needed to draw that line. The second question I want to ask Morgenthal is, do you think that Russia would be willing to negotiate and to divide the world into spheres of influence? Well, it has said so many times directly, indirectly, officially, privately and there can be no doubt on that count. The real question is where are you going to draw the line? And do you think that she would keep her word if she made it? Well, this depends very much upon the interest it would have to keep its word. Then I take it, Morgenthal, that the two imperatives that you suggest the reference to American foreign policy is, first, that we should rid ourselves of our illusions and, second, that we should pursue a realistic policy. Now, what are our illusions and what are the realistic alternatives? I take it you believe that the first illusion is that we can hold our line and maintain our interests in Asia and Europe alike by military means alone. In truth, military means are adequate to solve the problems of Europe. They are not adequate, they are even disastrous in solving the problems of Asia. The second illusion to which you call attention is that we are engaged in a crusade against communism. In truth, we are engaged in the defense of our security against Russian imperialism. And the third illusion is that we can arm our allies and ourselves and hold the line along a 20,000-mile perimeter ready to counter the Russians wherever they may choose to strike. In truth, what has contained the Russians in the past and which will contain and roll them back in the future is one thing and one thing alone the actual and potential power of the United States itself. And the fourth illusion is that we can pursue successfully a foreign policy by consistently yielding to domestic political opposition even though we know that this policy is contrary to our best interests. In truth, wise and courageous statesmanship will sacrifice temporary popularity to the lasting interest of the nation. and the fifth illusion is that all we need to do to preserve peace is to get stronger and stronger in a military way. And that negotiation for a reasonable settlement and a just settlement is equivalent to appeasement. In truth, the peaceful and successful promotion of the national interest requires two things arms and diplomacy. This means that we should have clarity of objectives and a recognition of our long-run genuine national interests that we should arm ourselves and grow strong that we should grow strong morally as well and third that we should practice the highest skills of international statesmanship. through diplomacy and through negotiation.
