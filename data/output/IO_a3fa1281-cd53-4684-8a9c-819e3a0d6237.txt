The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the bugle in my heart I hear the bugle calling Goodbye darling I stand on them Without me, off of the jagung euryden Tell me I am near at the front to fight the foe. Give us, soldier boys, a marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, fall in, it won't be long. We're on our way, hip hip hooray. We're going down south, hooray. And since makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I thunder. Wondering, darling, is your true. Distance only lands and shams there. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near your side. You, son. Be near your side. Be near your side. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother. Just because there is no other. She'll be happy in her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over. Yes, she will. Christ will see. When the harvest days are over. Yes, she will. Christ will see. Christ will see. When the sun gets flowers. No, he dies so free. He dies so free. He dies so free. You will see. You will see. You will see. The word you said. That's the time we do shall wear. When the harvest days are over. You shall well. When the harvest days are over. Yes, be near. My, just be near. So as a band played on. He's life for the flow, with a trail he adored as a band played on. But his brain was so loaded it was nearly exploded the poor girl would shake before. He derries a girl with a flowery ground as a band played on. Sweet Adeline My Adeline At night, dear heart For you I find In all my dreams Your fair-faced be You're the flower of my heart Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline He was sold for an old man's gold. He's a bird in a gilded hay. A little brown car, a shady green spot. So happier home I find. My heart's barely gone, I love only one. She's the girl I left to be mine. Just one girl, only just one girl. Where on earth I know that there's not my heart. The Lord ain't just a day. I'll be happy forever, Christian wonder. I'll be happy forever, Christian wonder. I'll be happy forever, Christian wonder. I'll be happy forever, Christian wonder. I'll be happy forever, Christian wonder. I'll be happy forever, Christian wonder.

I'll be happy forever, Christian wonder. And the moon will pass by the snow, and the sea will not be near. For the place that her heart is challenged, and the sea will stand in true. And she lost the land of the sea, of a little boy in blue. Sweet Rosie O'Grady, my dear little rose, she's my steady lady, most everyone knows. And when we are married, how happy we'll be. For I love sweet Rosie O'Grady, and Rosie O'Grady the sea. In the coast of our time, in the coast of our time. To go into the sailing, with a lady's mind. To hold her hand and feel good, and that's a very good sign. To keep your birthday home, sing the blues of our time. As I walk along the Wapu Long, with an independent air. You can hear the girls declare, he must be a millionaire. You can hear them sigh and wish to die, you can see them wish the other eye. At the man that broke the bank at Mantecarlo.
