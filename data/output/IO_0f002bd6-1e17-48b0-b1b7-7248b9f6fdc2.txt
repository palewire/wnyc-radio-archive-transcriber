The End Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks is plenty of plenty, done a lot on the door. Pray somebody's a-goin' for all of them without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? I've got no lard on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to see. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complainin'? Not my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no sun, got no moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of plenty, got the great old days. Keeps the plenty, you're not the warrior, keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, and it's not a crime. Never was it long as I'm well. Never was it tried to be good, to be bad. What the hell, why is that I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my song, her head is a whole day long. What are you complaining? Got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my lord.
