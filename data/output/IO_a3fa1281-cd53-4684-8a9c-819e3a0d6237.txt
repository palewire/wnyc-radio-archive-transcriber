There's a name that's never spoken And a mother's house have broken There is just another one missing From the old home that belongs There is still a memory living There's a father unfulfilling And a picture that is found From the old home She's my sweetheart I'm her beau She's my Annie I'm her beau To the real valley To the world to fall The river I need to be To the real valley Is my sweetheart One evening in the month of May I met old Satan on the way I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die If you want to get to heaven in the good old way If you want to get to heaven in the good old way If you want to get to heaven in the good old way They're petit I'm her girl But my grandmother She was my gosh I don't know I made big Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, get the gun. Johnny, do the gun. Makes me falter at your feet, sweet Marie. Where did you get that hat? Where did you get that style? Isn't it a knobby one and just a proper style? I should like to have one just the same as that. Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir, but not goodbye. The past is dead, love cannot die. We're better far had we not met. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. Baby, baby, give me your answer too. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. You want me a smiling marriage, I can't afford a fairy. But you love me, God must be, I've been so dim for two. When you hear the rest of the things in me. For joy, love, and praise the human thing. And when the birds stand true. In the forest of the night is there a hot time. You're the one and the night. When you hear the rest of the night. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. I love you then. The End
