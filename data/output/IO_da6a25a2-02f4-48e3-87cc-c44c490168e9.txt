Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, from the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel here in New York City. Your city station brings you the proceedings of the New York Olympic Committee Governor's Dinner, which is being held to raise funds to send our Olympic team to Helsinki, Finland this summer. There are many notables present here this evening. Governor Thomas E. Dewey, who is to be the chief speaker, Mr. Lazarus Joseph, Admiral Halsey, Gustavus Kirby, President Emeritus of the United States Olympic Committee, and many, many others. And in just a moment to introduce the speakers for this evening's program, we'll hear the co-chairman of tonight's dinner committee, the Honorable Grover A. Whelan. As you can hear in the background, the police department band is playing. There is an extremely large audience here this evening. Gathered to participate in this dinner to raise funds to send our Olympic team to Finland. In just a moment, the Honorable Grover A. Whelan, Chairman of the Mayor's Reception Committee, will introduce the speakers for this evening's program. The speakers this evening will include Gustavus T. Kirby, who is President Emeritus of the United States Olympic Committee, the Honorable Lazarus Joseph, Comptroller of the City and Chairman of the New York Olympic Committee, and also Admiral William F. Halsey. The featured speaker, of course, as we mentioned before, will be the Honorable Thomas E. Dewey, Governor of the State of New York, and also Honorary Chairman of the New York Olympic Committee. The music in the background is being played by the members of the police band, directed by Lieutenant John McCartney. And earlier in this evening's program, here from the Grand Wallroom of the Daughter of Astoria Hotel, we heard selections by the police department fleet club, directed by Sergeant Edward Dilton. The Helsinki Olympic Stadium is situated in the midst of beautiful parks, almost in the center of the city of Helsinki itself. On the left of the stadium are the turf-covered football grounds. On the right is the recently-built swimming stadium, which normally seats 5,000 spectators, but will seat about 10,000 for the 1952 series of Olympic Games. The Olympic Stadium will seat 70,000 persons. It has a 250-foot tower, which dominates the newer part of Helsinki. The stadium is no more than a 20-minute walk from the center of the city. It was designed by two Finnish architects and includes an excellent center track around a turfed area. And now we hear the applause, and here is Grover Whalen. Your Excellency Admiral Halsey, Comptroller Joseph, ladies and gentlemen, this is the first night that I have been required, or will be required, to just read a number of notes. In the first place, I have been told that I must say this. The New York Olympic Committee is also sponsoring, and that's this gentleman over here, Larry Joseph. The final Olympic swimming tryouts at Astoria Pool. That isn't the correct name. It should be Bob Moses. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. And at Flushing Meadows on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The Olympic Carnival of Sports at the Triborough Stadium, a week from Sunday. And then they shall be received at City Hall on Monday, July 7th. Now, in addition to that, I've been told that, I have numbers on my cards here. Johnny Hayes, a famous Olympic story, deals with the marathon of 1908 in Italy. Collapsed near the finish line, was carried across the line. He was declared the winner. At first, but later disqualified, and in his place, the first man to complete the race, under his own power, was named Champion. Forty-four years have passed, and he still is the last American to have won the marathon. Johnny Hayes. Johnny Hayes. Another young man, called Irving Jaffe. New Yorkers never have been a match for other Americans at speed skating. So it was something of a surprise in 1932 when a New Yorker, Irving Jaffe, became the first American ever to win an Olympic speed skating title. What's more, Irving won three Olympic championships, a feat never yet accomplished by any other man in the Winter Olympics. Irving Jaffe. You know, the next one I am very much afraid to announce, and it says here, here's the only Brooklynite. You know where that is, Governor? Right there. And I haven't heard whether he's a Dodger or not, but nevertheless, ever to win an Olympic track championship, Charlie Bacon. Thank you. He won the 400-meter hurdles at London in 1908. That's yesterday. Now, number four, many of you will recall that this gentleman is the former champion of the New York State Athletic Commission. But tonight, he's to be known here as the Olympic lightweight boxing champion of... Heavyweight. Heavyweight? Light heavyweight. What do you know about it? I fought him. He fought him. The control... Light heavyweight boxing champion of 1920, Colonel Eddie Egan. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now, the card says, number five, in the olden days, the sport of walking was as popular as the horse and buggy. In recent years, competitive walking was just about to vanish from view when along came a young man who sets new records every time he sets heel and toe on the track. I'm glad he did that. He's leaving for Helsinki soon to represent our country in the Olympic Games. Harry Lastu. Now, the next one is a person that only the governor, who was very old, and the controller who was older than the governor, can remember it. I am a young child and never heard of it before. Gertrude Ednerly. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. She was the first woman to swim the English Channel. And it's a great pleasure to see her here tonight and to see her looking so well. I remember, Governor, may I say this? When you were a young man. When I was a child. Gertrude arrived down the bay. And, uh... Stop that. Don't be talking. But she arrived down the bay and on a very unusual occasion, she was brought up to, uh, the place called, uh, City Hall. We had a police commissioner at that time who didn't believe that there should be any protection at all for great celebrities. But this gal just blocked traffic from the city hall, from the battery right up to the city hall. And, believe it or not, we had, for the first time, close the iron gates of City Hall to keep the people out. And that was the salute that Gertrude Ednerly received from our fellow citizens of New York. Well, we have a fellow by the name of Buster. I don't know what his last name is. In 1932, only one American swimmer won a championship. Gee, we were terrible. In all the... In all the other events, Uncle Sam's, uh, boys tasted defeat. Now, Admiral, you listen to this. No. Our only winner, a handsome young man, became famous later as a moving, a moving picture star. Today, he's enjoying a bright career as a television show. Buster Krabbe. Thank you. There's a place called Yale. I don't know where that is, but it's up there in New Haven somewhere, isn't it, Governor? I didn't go there. Yeah, the Governor didn't go there, so he can't give me the directions. Yale, through the years, has had many pole vault champions. But in 1920, the university was presented, represented rather, by a young man who won the Olympic championship in the high jump. He is Dick Landon. But Dick didn't return from Antwerp with an Olympic title alone. Now, Dick, get up and stand up. He also brought home a bride. Pick up, will you? His bride was an Olympic champion also. A member of the Olympic swimming team in 1920. And in 1928, she was official chaperone of the woman's, I wish she'd been mine. Gee, these people are terrible. 1928, she was official chaperone of the woman's Olympic swimming team. Mrs. Alice Lord Landon. Now, just a minute. I'm not finished. There's the number one romance of the Olympic Games. And just the other day, the Landons celebrated the arrival of their second grandchild. Mr. and Mrs. Riches Landon. Thank you. well is the President Emeritus of the Olympic Games, Gustav Kirby, who knows more about the athletics and the great things that have been accomplished by our the youth of America. And it's a great privilege for me to introduce the President Emeritus of the Olympic National Committee, Gustav Kirby. Your Excellency, Your Royal Highness the controller of the City of New York, and my old friend Grover. And most important of all, far more important than any of us, my fellow Olympians, some of whom have been presented to you and many more of whom are here. Yes, the Olympic Games are great. You look at the cover of your program and you will find five circles. I wonder if you all know what those five circles mean. They mean the five continents and the colors in them are the colors you will find in some one of the flags of the nations of the world. So that at once you see that these five intertwined circles are indicative of what the Olympic Games are really for. And if you turn into the program you will find the important thing in the Olympic Games is not running but taking part. The essential thing in life is not conquering but fighting well. That is the motive, that is the reason for the Olympic Games. Not merely to win but to do your best. And that's what we've always done. Come with me if you will to Helsinki a couple of weeks from now when we open the Olympic Games. You'll find gathered there in the stadium which those brave Finns have built and rebuilt the elite of the world. Governors from all far and wide, north, south, east and west. You'll find thousands and hundreds of thousands of people. And the games will be opened by the singing of the way those Finns can sing. And they can sing, you know that. And then into the stadium will come the marching of the athletes of the world. They'll be led by Greece because as you all know the games were started in 1896 in Athens, Greece. And the last one to come in will be the Finns because they are the host nation. We will come in behind the American flag. The other nations will come in behind their flags. And the music of their countries will be played as they march. We'll march around saluting those in the royal box or the box of the president, whoever it may be. And then we'll line up. And then what happens? A representative of each nation comes forward and listens to the representative of Finland. And they all raise their hands and they give, they swear, that they are of the nations they represent. That they are that they are amateur. That they are taking part in sport for sport's sake. That's the big thing of the games. They're taking part in the games for sport's sake. And then the cannons will boom and pigeons will be released flying north, south, east and west. Indicative of the spirit of the games which is to spread goodwill throughout the world. Not merely to win, not merely to compete, but to spread goodwill. Because the Olympic games are to the end. That we may substitute for the bloody and futile field of war. The strenuous but peaceful field of athletics. That's what we go for. To endeavor to cement and bring together the nations of the world in friendly combat. Not in bloody war. And it's very, very significant that this year these games are being held right under the iron gate, the iron fence, as you may call it, of Russia. The strenuous but peaceful field of war. And it's very significant that this year these games are being held right under the iron.KA Cabinet for President Obama I the end that they may not be contaminated by us of other countries. But be that as it may, that is the way the games are done. And the games are to bring about and substitute for the bloody field of battle the strenuous but peaceful field of athletic supremacy. You here, I look around you fellow Olympians, and you have all helped. You've all helped to sow the seeds, which means for a better world, a happier world, a more peaceful world, one where we get along together, not fighting, not vindictive, but with the spirit of giving and taking, a spirit of doing our best for sports' sake, but of helping that everybody will come along and be our friends and not our foes. Finland is a wonderful little country. Some of you have been there. I have. And I'm looking forward eagerly to being there three weeks from now, two weeks from now, for the games. Well, why are they so wonderful? Because they're always threatened by Russia right at their door. And Russia could just walk over them if they will. But Russia is not only a great nation, but it's a very vindictive nation. I remember well in 1912 at Stockholm, when the Finns were all lined up ready to march behind their flag, and Russia said, No! Finland is not a country with its own flag. Finland must march behind the flag of Russia. Finland didn't do it. Thank God the Swedes were courageous enough to say that the Finns would march behind their own flag, and their victories would be indicated by hoisting their flag to the masthead, as they indicate by our victories by hoisting our American flag. Now, this is a grand thing. Now, this is a grand thing. And we'll never forget it. The main object of the game is not merely to win. The main object of the game is to spread throughout the world peace and goodwill. Now, if Finland, under the thumb, you might say, of Russia can do that, we of the United States and all the countries of the world should be able to do it. So I said the other day to the Finnish gathering, Finland is so much like the United States. I remember reading. Of course, I wasn't there. I was too young. I don't think I was even born there. In the Revolutionary War, when Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death. And that is just what Finland has said to Russia. They must have their liberty. They'll fight to the last man for the liberty. But they want to be friendly afterwards. They want to bring about goodwill, just the same as we here are friendly with England. But when the Revolutionary War was here, we weren't any too friendly. I remember well that flag of the northern states, which had a rattlesnake on it, don't tread on me. That's Finland and that's the United States. So we're going to a country, a little country, we, the great big United States, are going to a little country that has the same ideas, the same ideas, the high standards, the moral force of the United States of America. We here, Excellency, these athletes that you see, most of whom I've seen perform and are going to have, and their fellows that are following after them will perform, are messengers of peace. Not merely messengers are to win, but messengers of peace and goodwill. God help that we have the strength, that we have the courage, that we have the ability to spread this gospel because with it, the world will sooner or later become one. Without it, we'll be lost in nothing but bloody battles, futile and of no account whatever. So I say to you as President Emeritus of the United States Olympic Association, United States Olympic Committee, that you have gathered around here, Governor, and the great people who are up here, the best that we have, men and girls, men and women, who are courageous, who are able, but who want to play a friendly game, a game of cooperation, of coordination, a game where we will have peace and goodwill throughout the world. That's what we're for. That's what we're going to accomplish, and with our help, and with the help of God, we will come back with victories, but we'll come back leaving friends with us, behind us, and having friends there with us. Thank you very much for listening to my few words. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. When the mayor announced that the chairman of the New York City Olympic Committee would be Larry Josephs, everybody wanted to know, well, he knows a lot about dollars, a few things about cents, you know, dollars and cents. And they wanted to know why he was made the chairman of the New York City Olympic Committee. And I've had a terrific investigation take place to find out why he was named. And I found out that he was not a football player. His wife told me that. But that he was a basketball player, and what a basketball player. And the other day down City Hall, he made one of the most intellectual speeches as far as athletics are concerned and finances. He wrapped them all together very courageously. And finally, he came through with telling about what he did before he married his beautiful wife. It's a great pleasure for me to present to you Larry Josephs, the controller of the City of New York and the chairman of the New York City Committee, the Olympic Committee. Larry Josephs. Larry Josephs. Chairman, Governor, distinguished guest, Admiral Halsey, Kirby, Jerry Mahoney. You heard a lot of talk tonight about the athletes present. And we have others involved here who are champions in their own right. For instance, Grover Whalen. Grover Whalen is the best-smelling citizen in the city of New York. And while I appreciate, Governor, that you are the number one citizen of the state of New York, we still have the right of free speech. Governor was quite an athlete himself. He ran quite a few races himself. I, uh, myself did very little, so far as New York City Olympic Committee is concerned. But we had a very able staff. Colonel Henschel. Walter Brown. Ray Deering. Dick Maher. Mr. Kirby and a few others. And I personally, Governor, desire to express my appreciation to you for the aid and cooperation you gave us on this drive. A lot of medals have been handed out. There's one person in this room who's entitled to a larger medal that was ever given to any Olympic champion. Any woman that could live with me for 33 years is entitled to a medal, and that's Mrs. Joseph. My athletic career goes back many, many years ago when I was a kid on the East Side. I began playing basketball in the Education Alliance. Then in the parks. Then in the parks. Then in the parks. Then in the parks. Then in the parks. Then in the parks. Tompkins Square Park. PS number two. And I played for the High School of Commerce. And then I played for NYU. Then I did some other things that I don't care to mention, Governor. Statute is a bar. Is that correct, Governor? Statute is a bar. Statute is a bar. Is that correct, Governor? And after I got through playing for NYU, I played for the 92nd Street YMHA. And we had a chap that was the manager of the team. We were purely amateurs at the time, but we used to play in Philadelphia, New Haven, other places not too distant. And he was a great businessman. We'd get about $10 for making the trip. The members of the team would receive an ice cream soda. The rest of the money found its way into the pockets of Colonel Henschel. And that's how the Bull of a Watch Company was started. Grover, let me call your attention a couple of forgivable mistakes that you made. He takes a guy that's 210 pounds and calls him the lightweight champion. And he tells you that Johnny Hayes collapsed. Johnny Hayes didn't collapse. Johnny Hayes won it. Johnny Hayes went across the line on his own power and his own steam. I don't know whether you know it, Governor, but we decided to hold a, in conjunction with the aquatic meet, a one-meter dash for the members of the Board of Estimate and an invitation. And an invitation is being extended to you. When I found out that a meter is, how far is it? Forty inches, I decided it was too far. So, Governor, I present you with the championship of that particular event. You don't even have to go into it. All right. Gus Kirby, this young chap that you heard a few minutes ago, told you about the great deeds that were performed by our athletes. This year is a significant year. We are picking and have picked some of our representatives. They are chosen on ability alone and nothing else. Race, creed and color means nothing. And as a matter of fact, it doesn't make any difference whether they're Democrats or Republicans. We are sending out to Helsinki one of the finest representative groups of men and women to ever represent the United States. And while it's true, as Gus said, that we would like to win, we have an important mission in this particular Olympic event. We want the boys and the girls of the other countries to see with our own eyes the type of youngsters that we have in this country who are brought up under our democratic principles and ideals. They can get first-hand information of what America means and what our ideology is. So regardless of whether we win, lose, or draw, they can take home to their respective countries, in my opinion, a fine picture, a mental picture of the type of boys and girls that we have in this country. And in my opinion, that's tremendously more important whether we win or lose. So you ladies and gentlemen who are here tonight, who are playing an important role in this coming event, are entitled to the plaudits and the credit of all who are affiliated with this drive. And as the chairman of the New York City Committee, may I extend to all of you my deepest and most sincere thanks for your efforts on behalf of the great Olympic Committee. We need every dollar we can get. Because if we fail to get the money that we need, some poor boy or girl who's driven so hard to get on this team might have to be dropped. And we're continuing our drive right down to the last day. And I know that with your continued cooperation and help, that we cannot fail in this drive. So thanks again, and I know that our boys and girls will give a very fine accounting of themselves when they go to health centers. Thank you very much. You know, I thought Larry knew everything in the world, but apparently he doesn't. I skipped a line, Larry. Oh, Larry. Let me read this again to you. A famous Olympic story deals with the marathon of 1908 when Delando of Italy collapsed. Say Johnny Hayes collapsed. The land of Italy. What did he say, Larry? Near the finish line and was carried across the line. That was Johnny. He was declared the winner at first, but later disqualified. And in his place, the first man to complete the race won on his own power. Take that home with me. I can read it. You can speak. You know, not too many years ago, there was a great man that came back from the South Pacific. And I remember very well that he was here on occasion when a sailor wrote a story about, called it, Nibbett, Halsey, and Mead. He won the war in the South Pacific, according to this story that he wrote. And tonight we are particularly honored by having not only a great and fearless admiral of our Navy, but also a great athlete who won honors before he took to the sea. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Toastmaster, your ecstasy, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen. I'm glad you gave me that applause before I started because as a speaker I'm a very poor ping-pong player. Mr. Whalen has spoken about my ability as an athlete. I was just remembering while he was talking about how it occurred. In the early part of the year 19-2 football season, I was one of the battering rams of the first team down there. I was a second class from that time, which corresponds to a junior, and they had a plebe playing fullback on the team. He was about six feet tall and weighed 185 pounds. And of course, the very early part of the game, he was knocked down and got kicked in the head. As a matter of fact, they had to put a silver plate in his head afterwards. The coach came along, looked along the bench to see who could pick out and sort of shook his head. There was nobody there. Then I could see his brain working. He wanted to see who the next man that got kicked in the head would do no harm to, and he finally called me out. From that time on, I was the poorest player on the two worst teams the Naval Academy ever had. So that's my claim to athletic prowess. I'm reminded when I see all these grand people around here today, I'm reminded of a story I heard the other day, which refers to athletic prowess and age. There was a very well-built young chap who went out to a golf club. He was all by himself, and he asked the professional if he could arrange a game for him. And the professional said he thought he could. He said there was a gentleman out there who happened to be about 75 years old who played a pretty good game. This young fellow sort of turned up his nose. They went around the course with this gentleman at 75. By the time they'd gotten in, the gentleman at 75 had trounced him so badly, he was just dragging all over the place. And he was very angry about it. And he asked this gentleman at 75, said, can I arrange a return game with you two days from now? This chap said, no, I'm sorry, I can't. He said, I have to go to my father's wedding. He said, what? He said, I have to go to my father's wedding. He said, how old's your father? He said, he's 98. My God, does he want to get married? He said, no, he has to. I am in thorough accord with what your President Emeritus has said about a futility of war and how absolutely foolish it is, and how we should do everything in the world to promote peace. I know that many remarks have been made about our athletes and other people go abroad being our ambassadors until they're very trite. But as a matter of fact, it's very true. I also noted his remarks about playing a game for the game's sake. I am partially in accord with that, not altogether. I used to think sports for sports sake was the only thing. I think we've handled that very well in this country by having our leading athletic teams and then going into intramural sports where everybody gets a chance to do anything. The reason I say that, because it is my experience during the war that our habit of putting teams on the field to win was what made us win this war. The men that we had, the athletes we had, became prominent in every service in the country during the war, were men that had gone in to win. And we have to go in to win if we have to fight. And God help us, I hope we never may have to fight again, because war is the most futile and foolish thing that man ever invented. It proves nothing. When it's all over, you have a victory and you have a vanquish. In a very short time, the tables may be reversed. It settles nothing. It can be settled by common sense. With our athletes going abroad to compete against all the athletes of the world, it's a wonderful thing. As one of the other speakers said here tonight, our athletes are chosen not because of race, creed, or anything else. They're chosen because they're best amongst free competition in this country. Our philosophy of life and our philosophy of government in this country is that we have free competition. And with competition, may the best man win. And the best man have won, or will have won, before they're chosen for this team to go over to the Olympics. They are, as again has been said, they are going to be sized up by all the nations of the world, particularly by, what shall I call them? I won't call them anything. People behind the Iron Curtain. And they're going to be watched very closely by those people. And I think it's a perfectly splendid thing that the flower of American youth, athletically, men and women, are going over there. And the people behind the Iron Curtain are going to see what the Americans are. They're going to see that these people are not chosen for anything except for their ability to excel in the particular fields they're in. And I think it's going to be one of the finest ways of selling our ideology of life, philosophy, and government in this country that could be invented. I'm all for it. Naturally, I hope our people are going to win. I haven't much thought about the Iron Curtain people who are going to be able to put them out. But that's beside the point. We are competing with all the nations of the world. Naturally, we want the best man to win. And I hope the best man does win. And I hope that best man is an American citizen. I thank you all for listening to me. The chairman of the Mayer's Committee for the City of New York, the Honorable Larry Joseph, is terrifically pleased, I'm sure, tonight, at the fact that His Excellency, the governor of the state, took time out to show his interest and his approval of everything that's being done in connection with the Olympic team, the enthusiasm which has been shown in the City of New York, and I'm sure that all of us are indeed grateful to the Chief Executive of the State of New York, the Honorable Thomas E. Dewey, for being with us tonight. Governor Dewey. The well-indistinguished guests and friends of the Olympic team, I want you to know that you are nowhere near as surprised as I am to find that this is the Governor's Dinner. I admit to appointing a committee and giving it all the encouragement I could and to agreeing to come on a date. And beyond that, I am entitled to no credit for the excellent food for the charming company or for the very great success that has been already achieved in the raising of funds. Of course, I hope that the million dollars that people promised on that radio program the other night becomes a million dollars. And if it comes fairly close to that, the funds will have been raised. As I scan this program and look over the names and the faces, it seems to me to be reminiscent of a lot of things. And of course, first of all, the police department reminded us of a few things. They have contributed the most remarkable variety of aspects of life in this country. I wonder if any of you remember the two whales, as they were called. The weight throwers, Matt McGrath and Pat McDonald. And the 1920 boxing champion Bill Spangler. And Bob McAuliffe, the sprinter who was known as the Flying Cop. And so once again, the New York City police have been participating in the Olympics, and this time in a much different fashion by making the dinner which helps to raise the money a musical success. And we appreciate very much indeed their contribution. I hope also that there will be some of New York's finest on that team. Good. Henry Wittenberg and who else? We don't know any more names yet. It has been remarked that the Olympic Games are going to be held on the rim of the Iron Circle. I doubt if anyone can fully appreciate what a grim business it is to be on the rim of the Iron Circle, unless you have actually lived there or walked along it. Unless you have been at a figurative or a genuine fence and looked across it and thought to yourself what it must be like to be across that imaginary line. We see a rather continuous flow of evidence of what it is really like. And I wonder what the Russian radio and press are doing today about the three men who fled from behind the Iron Curtain in the Balkans into Greece just a couple of days ago. I wonder what they did about the Czechoslovak athletes who attended a great athletic exhibition only about 18 months ago. And took refuge in the country where they had been sent abandoning their allegiance to Czechoslovakia, who it which had selected them as its official representatives. It must be pretty hard to keep that from the knowledge of the people at home. And of course to them it indicates that there still is a ray of hope in this world because people can get out from under the Iron Heel. I was in such an area last summer. We walked along a good portion of the border between Hong Kong and Red China. We looked through binoculars when we went back further at a police station, watching the unloading of some smuggled rubber which had come up the river the night before. We saw the fence as we walked along it which had been built by the British. To symbolize rather than to prove anything the actual demarcation between freedom and slavery. The important thing was the people whom we found on our side. A hundred scholars addressed a letter to me. A hundred men headed by seven Chinese scholars in a row who were presidents of universities or professors. in the learned arts or sciences of Chinese institutions of great distinction. All seven of the first names were graduates of Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton, Chicago, or the University of California. And they addressed a letter, one of the most eloquent and beautiful letters I have ever seen. I've taken the liberty of quoting it many times since. In which they said they had every kind and shade of political opinion between them. And they differed on almost everything except one thing. And that was that existence under a totalitarian communist dictatorship was impossible. And they had abandoned their possessions, their friends, their positions to become refugees in Hong Kong. In order to carry on the flag of freedom for the hope of a free China. You're going to be very close to that kind of a line in Helsinki. You who are going. Those whom this dinner is helping to send. And they are going to contribute regardless of their knowledge of the fact. To an understanding behind that wall against freedom and information. That all the things they read and all the things they're told in the Hate America campaign. Which is stepping up day by day behind the Iron Curtain. Are false. It must be perfectly obvious that young men and young women. Who can travel freely beyond the borders of their country. And compete in athletics. And are free then to go to any other place in the world that they want to go. Do not leave the kind of a regimented existence. Which the Russian propagandists would like to convey to their people that they do. In other words, your presence. The presence of all the Americans who will be there. Is a physical demonstration that the whole structure of falsehood. Out of which the Soviet Union would like to reduce the rest of the world to slavery. Is false. The people who are not. They also greatly exploit alleged discriminations in this country. Some of which are real and some of which are unreal. The fact is. That the living presence of human beings on this rim of the Iron Circle shows. That whites and Negroes and American Indians and Chinese and Hawaiians. And Christians of every shade of belief. Catholics and Protestants and Jews have competed. And the best we have. And the best we have. Regardless of. Who their father was. Or how they worship God. Is there. And they're there voluntarily. Unlike the Russians. They know they won't be shot if they lose a race. Unlike the Russians. They know that if they come in second. They won't be sent to Siberia. I was in Berlin three years ago. And I had a rather interesting experience. Because the occupation asked me to call on the mayor of Berlin and the city council. And I said. What's the reason? I haven't got too much time. And I wonder if it's necessary. And they said. Well everybody thinks that you. It's a must. So when I'm abroad. I do as I'm told. By the official representatives of my country. And I went to the city hall in Berlin. And there I was greeted on the steps. By an aging gentleman. Named Ernest Reuter. And we went inside. And he said. I suppose you're wondering. Why we ask that you call on us at city hall. And I said. Well I was a little curious. I knew you were busy. And I had a short time here. He said. Well you see governor. Did you see those. Those 4,000 people. Who assembled in front of city hall. In Berlin. To see you. I said yes. I was a little surprised. And he said. They know. As do all the people of Berlin. That you ran for president of the United States. Last year. And I said yes. And he said. Well you see. They wanted to know. Whether it was really true. And I said. What do you mean. He said. You're coming. Here. As an honored guest. Prove. Something they never heard of. That you can run for the highest office. In the greatest nation in the world. Be defeated. And still be alive. Our Olympic. Men and women. Are going to prove. That they can go. They can take a beating. As good sports. And smile. And congratulate the winner. They're under no orders. From a. Gestapo. Or an Ugg. They're going to prove. That they can win. And be gracious. And not arrogant. And not proud. They're going to prove. That the free world. Produces. Gentility. Courtesy. Liberty of spirit and mind. Our Olympic champions. And those from the other parts of the free world. Are going to be there. Mingling in a way which cannot be denied. Because you cannot erect a barrier high enough. To prevent the truth. From getting through it. And around it. And over it. And under it. They're going to be there. Proving. That people of every race. And color. Of every language. Who cannot speak together. Who have no means of communication. Can nevertheless have. Affectionate and friendly regard. Though competing with all they have in them. For their country. And for honor. They're going to prove. They're going to prove. There is something. Vastly more important. In this world. Than the glory. Of a set of bureaucrats. Who run a tyranny. They're going to prove. That the human mind. And the spirit. Can never be suppressed. By the acts. Of an individual set of men. Of an individual set of men. Or by any ideology. However ugly. This dinner is very important. Whether we had 100 or 100,000 people. At this dinner. It is a symbol. It is a symbol. Of the support. Of the people. Of this country. Just as that television show. Was the other night. When so many. Out of the bounty. Of their spirit. Contributed. Of their goodwill. By watching. And of their substance. By contributing. Where. In any totalitarian country. Could the athletes. Be freely selected. And then supported. By the generosity. Of the people. Of course. In the first place. They haven't got any money. To spare in those countries. They haven't got enough money. For black bread. And in the second place. They have the opportunity. To share. Not merely to be told. Of the people. Of course. None of us. Has the illusion. The Olympics. Or diplomacy. Or business. Or trade. Or anything else. Will achieve. The peace of the world. But as. As Admiral Halsey hinted. And others have indicated. It must be. Devastatingly clear. The peace of this world. Would be secure. If it were not. For the evil designs. Of 14 men. Who live in the Kremlin. There would be. No threat. To the peace. There would be. No necessity. For vast armaments. For vast fleets. Of airplanes. For great navies. For great armies. The only reason. It exists. Is because. A few men. Have delusions. That they can conquer. Both the spirit. And the bodies. Of men. And I assure you. That all the history. Of the world. Proves. That no group. Of men. Can ever conquer. The spirits. Of men. Even though. They possess. Their bodies. So everything. That this dinner. Does. Everything. Our team. Does. Is a contribution. Toward. The demonstration. Of the ultimate truth. I congratulate. All of you. Upon your interest. In staying. In the city. On a hot night. And coming here. To attend the dinner. Even though. It is a blessedly. Air conditioned room. I imagine. That if I talked. For two hours. I would do you. A great favor. Because you wouldn't. Have to go back. To your. Un air conditioned. Bedrooms. Tonight is late. And sooner or later. You have to meet. The realities. Of life. But it was a real. Contribution. By all of you. To take part. I want to thank you. For it. I want particularly. To thank Mr. Whalen. For carrying this load. As he. Does practically. From force of habit. To the controller. Who has given. Of his time. However. Modestly. He deprecates it. To the controller. Who has given. Of his time. He deprecates it. To the making. Of his success. And all of those. On this dais. And the others. Who have had. Their bit. In proving. That free men. Can do things better. Than any other kind. Of people. In the world. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well. You know. It's very difficult. For anybody. To follow. The governor. After an inspirational. Speech. Such as he. Just given. But i'm sure. That. We can. Call upon. The. Chairman. Of the. New York City. Thank you. Personally. And tell you. What he expects. Of you. In the future. fortnight. The chairman of the mayor's committee for the New York City Athletic Olympics, the Honorable Barry Joseph. Well I don't know why it's necessary for me to get up again. First of all I, Mr. Governor, may I personally and I know I speak the sentiments of every man and woman in this crowd for your very fine remarks. We all enjoyed it. We know it comes from the bottom of your heart and the experience that you had and it was wonderful to be guests of the Governor's Dinner to the Olympic Committee. Ladies and gentlemen, I thank all of you here tonight as I did before for the great part that you played in this drive to make possible the sending of all our athletes to Helsinki. We have other affairs of which you know about. Newspapers are carrying it. We'd like you to enjoy all those affairs for two reasons. First, they're wonderful affairs and second they add to the coffers of the Treasury of the Olympic Committee. Governor, you're very practical. While you said that the million dollars was pledged the other night, we don't know how much will come in so we can't stop. So attend these affairs, keep up your fine work, and thank you again for all that you have done for the success of this Olympic drive. Thank you very much.
