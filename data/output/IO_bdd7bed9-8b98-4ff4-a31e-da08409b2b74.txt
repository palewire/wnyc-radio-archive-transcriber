Six, that there should be formed a League of the Nations of the World in a common and binding agreement for genuine and practical cooperation to secure justice and therefore peace among nations. So, my friends, we celebrate here with special appropriateness the birthday of the Republic of Czechoslovakia. The ancient Romans had a euphemistic way of referring to the death of a citizen. They said merely, he was. But we do not speak of Czechoslovakia in the past tense only, glorious as it was. Czechoslovakia still is in its spirit, though its body has suffered under the fury of hate. It is of interest to note that in the New York Times of the day following this declaration of the independence of Czechoslovakia, the following item appears. Congressman Fiorello LaGuardia of the 14th District, a major in the American Aviation Corps on the Italian front, returned yesterday on military duty. Incidentally, he expects to find time to deliver a few addresses in his district on patriotism and the war. And one need not remind this audience that the Congressman LaGuardia, who became later the mayor of New York, has been the best friend of Czechoslovakia in making possible the maintenance of the Czechoslovakian pavilion at the World's Fair. There is another birthday which must always be associated with this birthday. Every fifth year, during the later life of President Masaryk, I had part in the celebration of his birthday. Someday the two birthdays will perhaps be merged, for we must keep both of them perpetually. At the celebration of the 80th anniversary of President Masaryk's birth, I put our wishes for him in these lines. May he live out another brave quintennial of democratic teaching in the master's chair, then have vacation for a full decennial of philosophic calm in some sweet valley's air, and so complete the epical centennial in which he wrote his name on history's page, then passed in glory to his own millennial remembered as our Washington from age to age. The quintennial was fulfilled for him, who was himself born to fulfill the prophecy of that other great Moravian teacher, Cominius, born Cominsky. After the tempest of wrath has passed over, the government of thy country will be returned to thee, O Czech people. So does he enter upon his first millennial of an immortality. The quintennial of the world will be returned to the master's chair. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
