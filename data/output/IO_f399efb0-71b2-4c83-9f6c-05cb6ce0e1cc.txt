So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Europe and is coming to my city, she did not have only completed a cordial visit to all of us. She also gave homage to the city-mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, was here in Genova ambasciadora of democracy. She is so dear to the people of the United States, so dear to the Italians, especially the genoveses. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she was a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States and so every citizen of America, regardless of its origin and social class, she can come she has been able to help with the city-mother. So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of the courtesia, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo and the most important city of the United States and its own government, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is, above all, the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic democratic and has contributed to the rest of this man who belongs to the country and the great people of the United States to the great people of the United States, to the great people of the United States, to the United States, which we are profoundly grateful for because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made up to to rid ourselves of democratic democratic democratic when we have intervened so presently in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men and of men also, so today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocini of democracy and have operated intelligently because we have to defend the democracy in Europe and really in the world and defend the democracy in Europe and in the world and well, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Sindaco of New York is with this faith that we work because the democratic democratic democratic democratic are really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone and all of us are not easy to do for us to be able to do for sometimes we Italians don't understand we have to remember we have to remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is happened in the moment when we were we were gravated by the weight of the conflict They weren't Cape Can mean work we had abandoned It is with these sentiments, on the other side, that I salute you and the city of New York and say that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of democracy in our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in searching for your land is an example to all the genoveses. The tenacious, not credulous, against every man and the events of this man knew that this great land exists and looked at it. He went to the mountains and looked at the mountains and looked at the mountains, looked at the mountains, looked at the mountains, looked at the mountains that he wanted to find for everyone to join the world with the Christian cross. Well, it is where, by some people in Rome don't find now, it's whether he's s√¨ for disintegrating others, someone will find the path, the path for everyone to join everybody in peace and work.us Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to general, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Thank you very much, sir. Every little manina, there's the very first name. Every street signorina said it the very same way. These funny little words don't really mean a thing. It's just a phrase that nowadays Italians love to sing. O-si, o-ta-la, it's a wonderful word, tra-la-la-la. If anyone asks you how you are, it's proper to say O-si, o-ta-la. O-si, o-ta-la. If the ladies could ask you if you care, you don't have a star, no love affair, say O-si, o-ta-la. Does it mean yes, o-ta-la, does it mean no? Well, yes and no, cause see, cause a-la. Get together and sing, o-ta-la, it's easy to say, so try today. And I'll just make on the sea, come on, stop. O-si, o-ta-la. Cause they go, stop. O-a-la. O-a-la. Well, if there's countess down to saddle up, I to settle down. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. Thank you, Sergeant Dillon and men of the Glee Club.
