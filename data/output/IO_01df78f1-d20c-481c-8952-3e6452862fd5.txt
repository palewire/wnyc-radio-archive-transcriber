When you walk by a war bond, remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the boys overseas are giving their lives. You are only asked to lend your money. And on this theme, your city station microphones are set up at 29th Street and 7th Avenue on the southwest corner to bring you the ceremonies of the war bond rally of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry. Among the notable speakers to be heard will include our own mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Fiorello H. Ligardia. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Henry H. Engel, who is chairman of this rally. Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a privilege to present a great singing star who has graciously consented to be with us at this monster war bond rally. She has sung with the Metropolitan Opera Company, the San Francisco Opera Company, and is now one of the stars of that smash hit operetta, Rosalinda. It gives me great pleasure to present Miss Jean Merrill, who will sing our national anthem. Ozzy I Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Merrill. And now, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of this rally, I wish to present the chairman of the War Bond Committee of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry, Mr. George I. Fox. Thank you.

Here we have a very elaborate program prepared for you. We have some nationally known singers and some well-known speakers, among whom our very beloved mayor, the Honorable Fiorello Lagaria, will speak to you in a little while. I'm going to introduce to you the young man who will take over to this master of ceremonies on this occasion. A man who's a nationally known artist both on stage and screen who has just come back from the coast where he has entertained 195 camps. He is also appearing on the Campbell's issue program each Wednesday night. He is the star of the Siegfeld Follies. He's a man who gives of himself at all times that he's ever called upon to perform a duty for patriotic services and for very charitable causes. I give you the very fast approaching number one comedian of the United States, our very beloved Milton Burr. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Fox, it's a wonderful announcement for a skin dealer. I'm very glad to be here today, ladies and gentlemen, on this wonderful rally. It's very nice and warm out here. I should have worn my earmuffs today. But I want to tell you, pardon me, I just got up. It's a pleasure and a privilege, really, on behalf of the fur industry, and I'd like to be half of the fur industry. It's really a thrill to be up here on this rostrum with all these. I guess all you ladies and gentlemen in this very vast audience are wondering who these very, very gorgeous looking ladies are here with the roses in their hands. May I say that these ladies, I'd like to introduce them, have them stand up and take a bow. They're all mothers of all the boys from the fur industry that are seeing service. Let's give them a swell hand. Here they are. Thank you very much, ladies. Thank you. You look very, very pretty. Very. I want to tell you that everybody's going to be here. The mayor, Mayor LaGuardia, was supposed to be here a little earlier, but he's tied up. He's playing bingo up in 48th Street, you see. If he's here, I'm kidding, Fearella. But I, everybody, in fact, you know, the reason I'm here for another reason, I, I, very, very glad because I have a brother, Mr. Fox, you can sit down. We saw your coat. Looks all right. Looks. Gets up and shows his coat. And, uh, who's afraid of the big bad wolf? I.J. Fox. I, um, no, pardon me, I mean George Fox. But it is really, uh, my brother's in the fur industry. He's a caracal curler. He's got a wonderful job. You know how you, uh, curl character. They're curled already. Do I have to explain the jokes here today? But I want to tell you, it's really very, very, uh, a big thrill, ladies and gentlemen, really, to be up in this pond around. There is very, in fact, uh, Eleanor Roosevelt was supposed to be here, but it was too near. And, uh, I'm a little tired out. I've been ironing all day and forging my ration card. And I want to tell you, it, uh, this is like trying to get laughs at a murder trial. Will you relax? Laugh and the world laughs with you. Try and they put you on a good will. I want to tell you, it's very, very difficult trying to get laughs with the subway going underneath you here. But I want to tell you that I would like to introduce, I would like, I would like to go back to sleep. I would like to introduce, I'm really, I'm tired, really. I'm very happy, though, today. It's my anniversary. I've been married a year today. I don't know what to get my wife. She wants a man. I, uh, oh, now you laugh. I like that, uh, our New York finest, all these very fine policemen are doing a wonderful job here this afternoon. I want, I think, a swell hand for the New York's finest, boys. Let's give, let's give all the boys a hand. Except the guy up on 34th Street wouldn't let me through. And if he can hear me, I mean it. He's a, get out, get out there. He's a Harvard man. And, uh, no, all kidding aside, all these fellas, I played a cop in my last picture. I made a picture called Margin for Error. Who saw the picture? Anybody see it? Three, four, five. Thank you. You did. Hello, Ben. I'm glad to see you. Ben Platt's here. I guess he wants me to mention his name. I mentioned it. Now you go back to your store. All right. I played a cop in that picture and I had the most important part in that picture in Margin for Error. Joan Bennett, she's in the picture too and I have the most important part. At the beginning of the picture, I open the door and let Joan Bennett in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. That's the end of the joke. What do you want? Gasoline? Relax. May I present, may I present as our first surprise, ladies and gentlemen, may I present as our first surprise some kids from CCNY waving to me over there. How are you, kid? Fine, how are you? I'm playing hooky, huh? May I present four boys, ladies and gentlemen, that are from our very fine United States Coast Guard and all of them have seen action and fighting. One gentleman who was the head of the Southerners, Mr. Homer Smith.

I wish some of these employers were trying to bring back Starvation wages And the sweatshops And Macy's and Bloomingdale's and Abraham and Strauss Could come here and see this ground And incidentally, while we're fighting this war We are not going to permit labor standards to be brought down Now let Bloomingdale and Macy and Abraham and Strauss and Lord and Taylor take note of that And perhaps look at their own payrolls and give their employees a better birth You know, Ben Gold asked me to come here Make an appeal For this second war loan And after he asked me to come here and make the appeal And after he asked me to come here and make the appeal He just now told me you're oversubscribed already And of course I know that the fur industry will come through as they always do You know, as I said last night at Carnegie Hall The matter is very simple We either loan the money to our government And get it back with interest Or else Hitler and the Japs will come over here and take it away from us We get nothing back And we're not going to let them come over here And that is why we want to make this second war loan not only successful We want to oversubscribe it And I am sure that the flourishing, prospering, great industrial town of New York Will lead the whole procession Now of course, we have no illusions about this men It's going to be a long and difficult war There is no doubt as to the outcome But we must do a complete job And that means that there is a great deal of hard and difficult fighting ahead The news this week is rather encouraging The French, the British, and our American troops Are chasing Rommel and his army into the waters of the Bay of Tunis The army of the Soviet republicans are pushing back every attempt of the Nazi forces to break through The Russian army has now the Nazi army in the mud up to their knees And pretty soon they'll have them in the mud up to their necks It wasn't so many weeks ago When Hitler was making preparations for his march into Moscow And as I told you at the meeting, Madison Square Garden The only time the Nazi army will see Moscow will be when they'll be taken there as prisoners of war And yet, as I say, there's a great deal more fighting to be done And we have to fight until we've beaten and crushed and destroyed the Japs, Hitler and his little pal Mussolini too None of them are any good and never were any good And some of us knew that they were no good all of the time So I want to congratulate the fur industry of New York City Employers and the organized workers of the fur industry In getting an early start in this war loan In setting the example to other industries And I know that you'll make good for your country this time As you always make good This war is not only for our protection It's for a better world To bring about the assurance of peace and economic security Not only for our people, but for the people of the entire world Thank you, thank you, Honorable Mayor Thank you, Honorable Mayor Thank you, Honorable Mayor It was really a wonderful, wonderful speech I know the little flower so well I call him Bud Never forget the time I landed in California I came in on a plane And I landed at LaGuardia Airport Right on the brim of his hat But I do want to tell you Incidentally, I'm wearing an Adam's hat myself Looks like Adam wore it But I do Look, he's rehearsing there again Thank you May I Now you'll get a chance really to play that music They've been rehearsing there for about 15 minutes May I introduce now, once again The little lady that sang our national anthem at the beginning of the show And she's going to do a little song for herself And for you lovely ladies and gentlemen May I present to you the star, the singing star, Rosalinda, Miss Jean Merrill Let's give her a swell reception Thank you very much, Mr. Jean Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Lovely Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you I want to tell you I I'm only kidding, Mayor You know You know Just goes to show you Just goes to show you Now Fiorello Who just walked off the stage Did you see him smile?

He's a business manager at the Furrier's Joint Council. He is one of the most elegant voices of Labour. He's been, in a large measure, responsible for the success of this rally, and his associates in the union have given their time and energy in the handling of arrangements. May I present to you, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Irving Potash, and thank you, and good afternoon. Thank you. Now, first of all, let's express en masse thanks to Mr. Milton Perle for his generosity and his kindness to come here and be with us and introduce everybody. Give the hand now, everybody. Secondly, let me inform you that you stay on, and if you get into the shop a half hour or more later, you will be permitted to work it off, so stay until the meeting is over. And thirdly, let's see whether we can take our hands out of our pockets, all of us here. This is not just a meeting for the speakers from the platform. This is a meeting where all of you will have to speak. Those of you on the sides, all over, take your hands out of your pockets, and the rest of you to the right of me and those in the front. Let the gentlemen from the Treasury Department, let the United States government representatives know that you are here not only to listen to speeches, but you are here to demonstrate your readiness to support with money and with everything until we smash Hitlerism and wipe them off the face of the earth. Get your hands out and put them up. And this pledge to the United States government representatives here. Let's see your hands. Take them out of your pockets. Let's see this pledge from everybody here at this audience. Come up with your hands. Take them out. They won't freeze. All over, down the other side. Express your opinion and your determination. Next, you have on this platform for workers, women, mothers, members of our union, workers in this industry who have given their sons in the United States armed forces, some of them two sons, some of them three, some of them their sons and daughters, some of them sitting on this platform, your sisters working with you in your shops, members of your union, have had their sons over on the other side, who have already made their supreme sacrifice, who have already laid down their lives so that you and I and the rest of us in this world may live free of the boot of Hitler. They are right here, the mothers, your sisters, and your fellow members of your union and your industry. You have here a mother of a hero. You have read it in the newspapers only the other day of a member of our union, a young worker by the name of Abrams, who was a lieutenant in one of the bombers' fortresses that sunk three German ships in the Atlantic. That hero's mother is right here on this platform. These mothers have given their sons, and the United States Treasury Department is calling upon us to give money to buy bonds so that the United States government may be able to buy the best that the American people and the American workers can produce the best ships, the best trains, the best tanks and guns to their sons and the sons of millions more to put an end to Hitlerism, to put an end to slavery, to bring about the world free of the threats, free of the slavery imposed by Hitler and the conquered people, to bring about a better and freer world for all of us. These are the mothers here who have sent their sons for that purpose. Last night, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Morgan Cowell, spoke at Carnegie Hall and is opening remarks. When he opened the speech, he said, the second friend is no military secret. We all know that just over the horizon, we of the United Nations are piling up the thunderclouds of the greatest attack in history. Now we are ready to deal a few blows ourselves. And there will be blows that I can promise that will rock Nazi Germany to its rotten, blood-stained foundation. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States government, the Cabinet member of our government, opened the speech last night with a statement that we are ready and this second war bond drive is raised in order to make possible the invasion of Europe, in order to make possible the joining of hands of our brave American boys, of the heroic boys of the British Army, with the heroic people and army of the Soviet Union in one mighty invasion of Europe that will once and for all put an end to Hitlerism and his slavery. And it is these bonds that we made you to buy today that will give the answer of the fur workers to the American government, that we will give and give and give in every way possible to make possible the realization of the invasion of Europe, to make possible victory over Hitlerism in 1943. And now, it is my job and present job to introduce to you the next and last speaker, one who has inspired and led our union with its 80,000 members all over the United States and Canada to make a record of war activities that is a shining example for the entire labor movement in this country. One who is the inspirer of 7,000 members of our union who are today in the armed forces and who inspires these 7,000 members to fight in the front ranks of the American armed forces and who will give an account of themselves in the same manner and even more eroically and even with greater sacrifice than the membership of our union that has stayed behind to support them on this side. It gives me pleasure to introduce to you the president of the International Foreign Latter Workers Union, Ben Goh. France, it seems that we are bound to enter a new, very important and perhaps decisive phase of this great tragedy of mankind. It seems that a great many developments will take place in the year of 1943. It seems that a great many battles will take place in the very near future. and every battle will bring closer the day when all of us and the entire civilized world will gather to celebrate the great moment of the collapse of the Nazi cannibals and the victory of the civilized world. Tables are definitely turning slowly but surely. Not long ago, Hitler and his chiefs were bragging about the superiority of the German weapons. Today, it is generally recognized that our country alone succeeded in outproducing the Nazis to the decree that even the Nazis recognized this fact. Both in quality and quantity, our weapons are superior to the Nazis' murderous weapons, not long ago, the entire world was trembling with fear at the threat of Hitler that he is going to continue bombing London to a shambles. Today, this situation is entirely different. Our liberators and fortresses and the Spitfires and the Russian Sturmuriks are bombing Germany without a stop and he feels the taste of his blitzkrieg methods. Not long ago, Churchill in his speech stated to the British people that the only thing that he can offer them is sweat and tears and blood. Today, Hitler and Gables and Garens sing that song and they talk to the German people of love and tears and sweat. Not long ago, all of us were afraid that Hitler might carry out his threat to invade the British arms. Today, there is a great deal of thought about invasion, but the invasion of the United Nations and the European continent that will catch Hitler and the most brutal nutcracker in the history of military matters. On the one side, our boys and the British boys. On the other side, the glorious Red Army that will split the Nazi Army and annihilate it until the Casablanca decision of unconditional surrender will become a fact. Until recently, Hitler Cup come talking of speedy victory. Now, in our ranks, the force is a speedy victory. We are done. Interested in that victory? Come as soon as possible. We can't afford to prevent this war too long. It is no war that great, invincible, Nazi, cannibal army that threatened the entire world. the menace, the liberi, and the Soviet Russian battlefields will never fight again on the side of the Nazis. In order to carry through the great fight of mankind, we must make every effort to help our government, help the armed forces of the United Nations to make that possible. And we gather today, publicly and officially, to reassure our decision and make it clear that we are ready and willing and eager to back up that decision by action. that now we are opening the great campaign for $13 billion bonds and the fellow workers who hate fascism, who hate reaction, who despise oppression, who are always on the job to fight for democracy and freedom and the rights of labor and the well-being of our nation are called today to make the opening. The International Union intends to develop an intensive campaign to contribute $2 million to this fund to buy bonds. I ask, is there a motion to instruct the General Executive Board to develop the campaign among its members for $2 million in this month? Is there a motion to that effect? Is there any seconder to the motion? Regularly moved and seconded to instruct and empower the General Executive Board of the International Union to develop the campaign for $2 million in war bonds. All in favor. Signify by raising your hand and keep it up. Keep it up. Keep it up. Let's have a picture so that we can see it whether there is a unanimous decision. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. beat Mark Snell. Hold it. Okay, man. Done. Any opposed? Raise your hand. and this is the unanimous decision that we again serve no rest on the cannabis and on the appeasers and the agents of Hitler that we are ready to fight to the last drop of blood to annihilate the Nazis for the victory of the civilized world. At this time, may I ask you to take your heads off? I introduce and... Ladies and gentlemen, with this unanimous decision of the fur industry to back the second war loan of the United States government, we bring to a close this program of which has been taken part in the 29th Street, 7th Avenue corner, at which point the war emergency board of the fur industry has held its war bond rally. Among the speakers that were heard on today's program was his honor, the mayor of the city of New York, Mayor Lagardia. Milton Burrell served as emcee for part of the program, Henry Engel, chairman of the war bond rally committee of the fur industry, George I. Fox, chairman of the war bond committee, Lou White, chairman of the war emergency board of the fur industry, and Gene Merrill, that is, a metropolitan opera star, who sang the star-spangled banner in the Army Air Corps song. And also, we just heard from the president of the Furious Union, Ben Gold. Ladies and gentlemen, we, before we leave, remind you that once again, when you buy bonds, you are only lending your money while your own brothers, sons, and husbands are giving their lives. And so, on the theme of any bonds today, we conclude this program, which has been a public service feature of your city station. This is the municipal broadcasting system. and by this program, ends up being one country by part of the UU Foreign front for each other's ARC-ONESBOX and that was a fiat tempo before the end. And are starting not screen for για the MERCY an Hoe can ay If can be
