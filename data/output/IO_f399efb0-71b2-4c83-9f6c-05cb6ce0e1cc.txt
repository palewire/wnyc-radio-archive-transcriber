Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. Thank you. The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The National Anthem of Italy and the National Anthem of our own country, very brightly played by the New York City Police Department Band. Now here is Mr. Coleman. Yes. Mayor Impoletari, it is my distinct honor and privilege today to present to you and through you, the people of the City of New York, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of Genoa, Italy. Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The Mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. when he was elected mayor of Genoa last year. He defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success and when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scarnie of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And, Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeleteri is pinning the Medal of Honor the City's Gold Medal of Honor on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome looking man accepting the congratulations of the Mayor and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the Mayor. Mayor Pertuzio is about six feet two I would say weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again Mr. Coleman. The Mayor of Genoa. Honorable Honorable Sindaco of New York of New York is with profound commotion that I heardуса asved of the nature of the I have the facts and the acts that men have the same meaning. But there are the acts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Europe and is coming to my city, she has not only completed a visit of cordiality, but she has also taken homage to the city of Cristoforo Colombo and this is the one that was sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is also come to Genova and is also a democracy, that is so expensive to the people of the United States, but so expensive to the Italians, especially to the Genovese. For this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States and so every citizen American, independent of its origin and social class, can come she has been able to come to the city and to the high level of the city. So this, this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo to the most great city of the United States and to his mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is, above all, the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic life and has contributed to the rest of the country to make it a better way to the people of this country and the great people of the United States to the United States, to the United States, to the United States, which we are deeply grateful because we know all the sacrifices that this country has made to rid ourselves of democratic democratic freedom when we have intervened so presently in the war and to protect them today with many sacrifices material and of men and also to protect them so that today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocinio of the democracy and have operated intelligently because we have to defend the democracy in Europe and really defend the democracy in the world and defend the democracy in the world and well, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Impiniteri, Hon. Sindaco of New York, it is with this faith that we work because the democratic freedom are really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone and all. It is not easy to do our task. For some time we, Italians, we are not understand we are not understanding. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy was just in the moment in which we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. we haven't taken it all We grew up trying to call a close Hmm we met to get it to have somethingêtre as aら she must live we make of our life we raised pauvatos we could get crimes zarine and đây war Greef Alum we animals and we came wish to session I am a city of New York and I tell you that we are tenacious in the work of the democracy in our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. La tenacia di Colombo nel ricercare la vostra terra è un esempio a tutti i genovesi. Deriso, non creduto, contrastato da ogni avversità, dagli uomini e dagli avvenimenti, questo uomo sapeva che questa grande terra esisteva e l'ha cercata disperatamente. He went to the river, he went to the river, he went to the river, he went to the estuary, wherever he went to the passage that he wanted to find for all the world under the cross. Well, it doesn't matter if he then found the passage, it doesn't matter if each one of us finds the passage, if we persist, others will find the way, the way to find the way to find the way to find the way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts indeed which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to general, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship which means so much to us. You were greeted by all of us as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as a representative of democracy, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honoured with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end we shall succeed, we shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. Great clarifying. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very very quickly. Thank you very much. children.
