This week is World Trade Week, and here to proclaim it is His Honor, Vincent R. Impeletary, Mayor of the City of New York. Proclamation. Whereas the City of New York has achieved its position as the commercial capital of the world by reason of its global preeminence as a port for foreign trade, and whereas only through the acceptance of international commerce and mutual understanding by all nations of the earth can there be assured lasting world peace and prosperity, now therefore I, Vincent R. Impeletary, Mayor of the City of New York, do hereby proclaim observance of the week of May 19th through May 23rd, 1952, as World Trade Week in New York City, by display of the American flag and the World Trade Week flag, and do invite our citizens and friends to join in a fitting consideration and understanding of the importance of international trade to the American economy and its relationship to the prosperity and peace of our nation and of the world. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the City of New York to be affixed this 29th day of April, 1952, Vincent R. Impeletary, Mayor, by John D. Tierney, Executive Secretary to the Mayor. Mr. Mayor, in the name of the New York World Trade Committee, I thank you and the City Administration you so ably had for the fine spirit of cooperation you have accorded us. New York, the greatest port in the world and the most concentrated international market on the globe, should lead the country in the observance of a week about which the President of the United States and you, as chief of the greatest city, have issued proclamations. Let me repeat, Mr. Mayor, our thanks that you have made it possible for us to do so. Thank you, gentlemen. And in that same spirit, saluting World Trade, stabilizer of world economy. There sailed a seaman brave and bold upon the rolling sea. He wrought and sank from morn till night, no lark more blight than he. Station WNYC, in cooperation with the New York World Trade Committee, inaugurates this annual World Trade Week by presenting a transcribed dramatic interpretation of what world trade means to the economy of nations, as it affects you, the people of nations. I am thee, no one, no not I, and no one end me thee. In all the world, no greater evidence of world trade activities than that which New York Harbor affords. Great vessels bringing to these shores the output of other nations, and the lading of American materials bound for every port in the world. He wrought and sank from morn till night, no lark more blight than he. Tied up to one of the docks in downtown New York is a cargo freighter, and perched on a pile beside her, puffing on his pipe, sits the skipper, old Captain Jonas. Let's ask him what he thinks about world trade. Howdy. Yep. It's music to these old ears. A-listening to this old ship of mine, scraping her sides again the dock, like she was itching to get away. Like a horse, chafing at the bit to get a-going when his stomach's full. Like my ship here, her stomach's full too. Yep, full of cargo. She's stocked to the gunwales with all sorts of stuff, stamped, made in the USA. And like the stuff I brought here, stamped, oh, I don't know, seems like from every country in the world. Yes, sir, I often wonder what folks do without the sea and ships and a friendly exchange of the things each country makes and grows and builds. Yep. Well, blow the man down. You just can't keep a lad away from the boats and docks in the water. Now, can you? And listen, what's he doing away from school? Oh, hello, mister. Howdy, boy. What you doing away from school? School? No school on Sunday. Gosh almighty. Sunday, eh? I clean forgot. So, you came down to the docks. I'm always down here, watching the ships come in and go away. You like the sea, son? Sure thing. Must be wonderful to be a sailor like you. Yep. There's always something new for seafaring men. New ports, new people. And knowing you're bringing folks what they need and taking what they got to other ports. Yeah. Gosh, I wish I was older. Only seems like yesterday that I was a lad like you, a wishing the same thing you're a wishing. A lot of changes since them days. You see, I'm an old school skipper. My kind will soon be a thing of the past. Now, ships, skippers, crews, they're all what you call, uh... Modern? Yeah, modern. Today, shipping's a business. My kind? Well, we're seamen because mostly we love it. Yep. That's the word. Modern. Do planes carry cargos, too? They sure do. But there'll always be the sea and ships. Shh. You hear that, son? And there'll always be a crew that sings a shanty. We're leaving, we'll never forget. For we're bound, for I owe. Grand, and away, and away. What's ready? Right. Oye, aye, aye, aye. How many r Gateway take can beなく? So good, my baby And then you vice versa. You see, I'm an old card with your family. I was instantly worried, brought by you back with miami. And away, Ryo, I, I, and away, Ryo. So fare ye well, my bonnie young girl, we are bound for Ryo grand. We've a jolly good ship and a jolly good groom. Away, Ryo, a jolly good mate and a good ship or two. For we're bound for Ryo grand. And away, Ryo, I, I, and away, Ryo. So fare ye well, my bonnie young girl, we are bound for Ryo grand. And away, Ryo, I, I, and away, Ryo. So fare ye well, my bonnie young girl, we are bound for Ryo grand. Away to Ryo. Guess you'd say Ryo. Well, that's about where that plane was a-headin'. Well, what kind of cargo would that plane be carrying down there? Oh, medicines, I guess. The kind that cost a lot of money. Gotta get it there quick. See them planes, son? Nah, they can't carry the load the ships can. Well, what would they bring back here? Oh, some precious stones. Lots of little things. And what they can't ship by plane, they're all reliable. Ladies of the sea takes care of. Well, can't each country make the things they need or grow them? Then we wouldn't have to send things to them and they wouldn't have to send things to us. Now there's a great idea. If it'd work. But son, it just won't. Well, why not? Look at the things we make here without any help from other countries. Name it. Well, baseballs. Gosh, that's pure American. The game's American, but not the ball. Now there's rubber in a baseball. Isn't there? Yeah, but... Now, where's rubber come from? Why, son, I brought in tons of rubber from Malaya. So you see, without world trade, you couldn't even have a good baseball. Gosh, I never knew that. Hey, those fellas must like to sing. Yep, and I love to hear them sing. That's, um... Yep... Eight bells. That shall come up from below. From below. Eight bells! Eight bells! Eight bells! Brows out there, the watch from below. Eight bells! Eight bells! Eight bells! Brows out there, the watch from below. I love, love, love, love, love, my husband, one ship, and the weather. My husband was shipped in a whaler and sailed in the far northern sea. But being a bullhard a sailor, he cared not for I see nor breeze. Eggbells, eggbells, eggbells, growls out there the watch from below. Eggbells, eggbells, eggbells, growls out there the watch from below. La la la la la la, he's no longer a sailor. He often wakes up in la la la la la la, taking me still unaware. Rise up from the greatest delight. Eggbells, eggbells, eggbells, growls out there the watch from below. Eggbells, eggbells, eggbells, eggbells, growls out there the watch from below. Eggbells, eggbells, eggbells, eggbells, growls out there the watch from below. Boy, they sure do sing nice. nice. Bet they do. Those fellas on that truck seem to like it. They didn't pull away till their shanty was finished. Yeah. Say, mister. Call me Skipper, lad. That sounds more natural. Okay, Skipper. My name's Jimmy. Okay, Jimmy. Now, what was you going to ask me? That truck reminded me. Now, automobiles, they're made in the USA. We sure don't need other countries to help us build cars, do we? Son, America'd never have a car if other countries didn't export the stuff it takes to make them. How can you build cars without copper, tin, lead, nickel, zinc, aluminum, manganese, and... Hey, wait a minute, Skipper. You mean to tell me that all that comes from other countries? All that and a whole lot more, son. And other countries build cars, too, and they need materials. They can't get any place else but here. So, you see, like my old mother used to say, one hand washes the other. What sort of fair exchange? No sort about it, Jimmy. It just is that way. You can't think of a thing, I bet you, made in this country, or any country, that one don't need what the other has. Now, can you? Well, give me time and I'll think of something that's 100% American. Well, well, just you take your time, Jimmy. I'm a-listening to my crew a-singing, the skipper of St. Ives. Sing it out, my lads. And each wife she would be talking, each wife she would be heard. It seems to me, said Jack said he, we can't get in the world. Yakety-yak, said yakety-yak, yakety-yak, said he, said he, for say a little mermaid's hair. Say, boys, shall we go out to sea? THE BOW 총enge For a thousand years or so They remembered their wives in old St. Highs And thought it was time to go Yakety-yak said yakety-yak, yakety-yak said he Do you think they're at the same old chance? Say boys, shall we go home to sea? Say boys, shall we go home to sea? Say boys, shall we go home to sea? Yakety-yak said yakety-yak, yakety-yak said he A chathering wife, a chathering wife A chathering wife, the place of one's life Come boys Let us go back to the sea Now ain't that something? And wouldn't you be something if you thought up a thing made entirely of American stuff? Well, Skipper, then I am something, because I've got it Well, now patten down the hatch, clear the decks, and fire away The telephone Well, shiver me timbers if you ain't got it Or, uh, almost Almost? Yep, almost If it wasn't for copper, aluminum, mica, and fabric, darn me if you wouldn't have found it Oh, darn it, I give up Might as well, son Someday when you grow up, you'll learn that most every country's got a hand in what every country manufactures Ever notice when countries get to arguing with one another, and they come to blows? War, I mean That you begin to notice shortages Well, that's because output stops So there's no input What output there is, is used for war stuff Now, Jimmy World trades, what makes the world go round Without it, this here thing called progress would come to a stop Or be slowed down, leastwise Yeah, I guess you're right That's all there is to it, Jimmy Except, you remember That skippers of planes, and trains, and trucks, and we who go down to the sea in ships Pilot the carriers that brings what one country sends the other And put them all together You've got world trade Oh, thanks, Mr. Skipper Guess I'll be gone Thanks, for what? For helping me when I take up economics Boy, I'll be way ahead of the other fellas And if you want to go to sea Sometimes, uh, you better learn something about St. Elmo Huh? Who's St. Elmo? The patron saint is seaman, Jimmy And are the ships that carry world trade There sail the steaman, brave and bold Upon the rolling sea He wrought and sang from morn till night No lark more blight than he Saluting world trade Stabilizer of world economy Station WNYC, in cooperation with New York World Trade Week Committee Has presented this program in salute to World Trade Week As proclaimed by his honor, Mayor Impeletere Our sincere thanks to the balladeers The group of singers who so ably supplied the sea shanties They are the men of a leading Long Island men's glee club And are under the direction of Mr. Avery Lochner And to the cast, Arthur Seelen Who was the skipper and Ronnie Less Who played the boy The script was written by Maurice Barrett For Mr. Arthur Crone, Vice Chairman and Treasurer of New York World Trade Week Production assistant, Carol Schnapp Your announcer has been Sy Freed By the way, among the activities of New York World Trade Week Are, on Tuesday, a harbor inspection tour Under the auspices of the Port of New York Authority And the New York Central System On Wednesday, the big event will be the World Trade Luncheon At the Waldorf Astoria Where Rear Admiral Ellery W.
