Here now is our chairman, the prominent member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. John Coleman, who was just introduced a number by the Police Department Bank. envo panelists The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The National Anthem of Italy and the National Anthem of our own country, very brightly played by the New York City Police Department Band. Now here is Mr. Coleman. Yes. Mayor Impoletari, it is my distinct honor and privilege today to present to you and through you, the people of the City of New York, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of Genoa, Italy. Mr. Mayor. Thank you. Mr. Coleman, Mayor Pertuzio, Dr. Mazzio, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a two-fold pleasure for me today to greet my friend, the Honorable Vittorio Pertuzio, the Mayor of the ancient and renowned city of Genoa. It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The Mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. when he was elected mayor of Genoa last year. He defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success and when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scarnie of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visitor. And, Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally and in behalf of the people of the City of New York that I represent on this occasion in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy but throughout the world express to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind.

She has also made a great honor of Cristoforo Colombo and this is been sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is here in Genova ambasciatore of democracy. And here in Genova ambasciatore, she is so expensive to us, but that is so expensive to us, so expensive to us, so expensive to us, so expensive to us. And above all, for this, on.

So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of the courtesia, the Hon. Impeliterian. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and his mayor, who has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is, above all, the affirmation of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic and has contributed to the rest of the country, and that has contributed to the rest of it, this visit is the salute of the Italian people and the great people of the United States, the United States, which we are profoundly grateful for, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made to make us for free to make us democratic democratic freedom when we have intervened so presently in the war and today, with many sacrifices material and of men, so today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocini of democracy and have operated intelligently to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in Europe and to defend the democracy in all the world.

It is not easy to do. For some time we are not understanding, we are not understanding, but we must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just in the moment when we were gravated by the weight of the conflict. In the you words, the Republic, the court is drawn to us to go. In theraits of this reading movement we have gone up our war, in our Ł��고さ to increase our discriminatory to多数 personnel and月ziehen its true faith. It is with these sentiments, on the other side, that I salute you and the city of New York. And I tell you that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of the democracy in our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa. The tenacious of Colombo in searching for your own land is an example to all the genoveses. The tenacious, not credulous, contrasted by every man and the events of the world, this man knew that this great land existed and looked at it desperately. He went to the river and looked at the river and looked at it everywhere, looking at it, looking at it that he wanted to find the world to join the Christian cross. And then, it is not important if he then has found the passage. It is not important if we don't find the passage. If there is a way to persist, others will find the way. The way to find the way everyone is free, in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to general, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win.
