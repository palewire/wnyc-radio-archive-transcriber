They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all big. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gel, got my tongue, my head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gel, got my gel, got my door, got my door. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got the sun, got the moon, got the people see. The folks with plenty of money, start to pray all the day. Keeps the plenty, you're not the worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time to cry. Never was it long as I'm well. Never was it dry, to be gone, to be bad. What the hell, why is that I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gel, got my gel, for heaven's whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gel, got my gel, got my gel, got my love. I've got my love, got my love. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Beth.
