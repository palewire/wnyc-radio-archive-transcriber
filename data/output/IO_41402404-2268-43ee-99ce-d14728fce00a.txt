Today the Salvation Army commemorates its 31st annual Prison Sunday. In 1,200 penal institutions throughout the United States, the Army of Peace, with its brilliant flags, its uniforms, and its sounding brasses, has brought its message of friendship and goodwill to thousands of men and women, many of whom have half forgotten, if they ever knew, the meaning of goodwill and friendship. Tonight, Station WNYC brings you the Salvation Army's Brooklyn Citadel Band and male chorus in a program of Salvation Army music, under the direction of Captain Edward Lowcock. They will start their broadcast with a Salvation Army march, victors acclaimed by Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell Coles. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ You just heard the Brooklyn Citadel Band of the Salvation Army playing the march victors acclaimed.

At the name of Jesus, Satan holds the plea. On their blood for soldiers, unto victory. Till foundations quiver at the shots of grace. Comrades lift your voices, love your anthem, praise. Hun, hun, hun, hun, hun. Onward, Christian soldiers, hunting as to war. Looking unto Jesus, who is gone before. Like a mighty army, through the church of God. Somers we are treading, where the saints have gone. We are not divided, our one body. We've won in hope and doctrine. One in charity. Hun, hun, hun, hun, hun. Hun, hun, hun, hun, hun. Onward, Christian soldiers, hunting as to war. Looking unto Jesus, who is gone before. Here in the studio this evening is the head of the Salvation Army Women's Prison Bureau, Major Dorothy Berry, who will tell you something about her work. Major Berry. Thank you, Mr. Child. Nearly 60 years ago, William Booth, our founder, said in writing of the Salvation Army's work among convicted persons, Our people, thank God, have never learned to regard a prisoner as a mere convict with a number instead of a name. To us, he is a human being, to be cared for and looked after as a mother looks after her ailing child. I suppose that was a rather appalling statement back in the 19th century, when a prison sentence was pretty generally regarded as society's quite justifiable vengeance on those who had broken its laws. However, things have changed since then and are still changing. Each year we recognize more clearly that the purpose of our institutions is not to get even with those who have broken our laws or to frighten them into obedience. Rather, we must help them become useful, contented human beings. And strangely enough, as our psychologists and caseworkers and penologists increase their understanding of the terrible loneliness, the sense of being cut off from all warm human ties which causes the delinquent to turn against society, they come steadily closer to agreeing with the ideas of William Booth. They recognize the delinquent needs to be recognized in an individual who can be reached and helped by patient good sense and understanding. In the eleven states of our eastern territory, there are 212 penal institutions which our officers visit at least once a month, holding religious services and interviewing all those who want help and advice. Often, too, we are called into court when a prisoner needs help or is to be put in our care. We also have in our charge throughout the country hundreds of parolees whom we supervise and for whom we find work and lodgings. We do all these things knowing if they are to have any real and lasting value. We must somehow win the trust and confidence of these people in such a way that we can help them to a better relationship with their fellows and to the deeper religious understanding which we believe must be the source of spiritual regeneration and growth. Thank you, Major Berry, for what you've told us about this great work of the Salvation Army. And now, the Brooklyn Citadel Band, directed by Captain Edward Lowcock, will play the Star Lake March by Eric Ball. the Captain Edward Lowellawa by Eric Ball. The Captain recalling his brother and John hàng Grail as he probablyquisites Aa unpredictable. And he asked the president of the four managing families to deliver the Antoni Jones Center for theNI's The End The End The End The End This is the Salvation Army's Prison Sunday. I'm going to ask Major Berry once again to step to the microphone to tell us what this day means to her and her fellow officers, and to the men and women in penal institutions throughout the nation, whom they have reached today. Major Berry. Well, let's take a look at this. And I'm going to say, I'm going to say, Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And now the Brooklyn Citadel male chorus directed by Mr. Walter Orr will sing the mudgelove hymn Rock of Ages. Rock of Ages fell for me. Let me hide myself in thee. Let the water and the blood from thy wounded side with blood. Be of sin the cup of pure. Save from wrath and make me pure. While I draw this bleeding breath. When my eyes shall close in death. When I rise to worlds unknown. See thee on thy judgment throne. Rock of Ages. That of course was the beautiful Rock of Ages. Sung by the Brooklyn Citadel male chorus directed by Mr. Walter Orr. The river and the river and the river. That of course was the beautiful Rock of Ages. That of course was the beautiful Rock of Ages sung by the Brooklyn Citadel male chorus directed by Mr. Walter Orr. Now the Brooklyn Citadel band of the Salvation Army will play the Crusaders hymn Beautiful Savior. Here we are, too.
