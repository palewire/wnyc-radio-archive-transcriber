All is Johnny, I've heard it through, I know. Here's the first night of the night party. Two little girls in blue, lad. Two little girls in blue. They were sisters, we were brothers, and learned to love her too. And one little girl in blue, lad, who won your father's heart. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have drifted apart. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country, in her face and manners too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I see. You're spoiled, how you do all the milk, you're mighty lucky. Comrades, comrades, ever since we were born, sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy.
