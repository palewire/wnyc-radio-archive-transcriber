For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are on me. Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got my gals, got my tongue, and I got my gals, got my tongue. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got my gals, got my gals, got my gals. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I got the sun, got the moon, and the people see. I got plenty. The folks with plenty of plenty, got to pray all the day. Keep the plenty, you know how to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away, away.
