Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Cooper Union Forum, and a very good evening to our WNYC radio listeners. If your chairman sounds a little more gravel-voiced this evening than usual, it is his voice, not your ears. I have been very carefully taking the contents of a bottle. It said, do not repeat more than once every four hours. I should state that this bottle was going in my nose, ladies and gentlemen, not in my throat. And after two days of doing this, I read the fine print at the bottom of the bottle, and it said, after continuous usage, this medicine was liable to make you restless, sleepless, depressed, and irritable. I've been doing it for two days in an effort to get over that feeling. It only cost me 50 cents. I guess it was cheap. At any rate, I feel, of course, a lot stronger thinking that we have a doctor in the house, in fact, a very fine doctor on the same platform with me. As most of you realize this evening, our discussion is some psychological problems of the preschool years. And our speaker this evening, Dr. J. Louise Despair, has been one of those helpful types of people ever since she was born in Versailles, France. Dr. Despair is trained in nursing, trained in medicine, won honors from the University of Paris. Worked as a nurse with the French Army during World War I. Has worked with children. Has come over to this country. And among other things, taken her citizenship papers, American citizen now. But amongst other things, medical degrees, psychiatric study and degrees, research work in psychiatry. She is, at the present time, assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at the Cornell Medical School and Hospital. And assistant attending psychiatrist at Payne Whitney Hospital. I should mention that she has written books and papers. But like all famous doctors, of course they have written books and papers. I advise you to read some of the doctors' fine works on the emotional problem on children. It gives me great pleasure to introduce to you Dr. J. Louise Despair. Dr. Despair. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege tonight to present to you some of the psychological problems of the preschool years. The hour is short and the subject is vast. So I can only touch upon the most common problems encountered in this two to six-year-old age group. To this end, I shall give you a picture, necessarily condensed, of the emotional development of children, introduce as I go along the difficulties associated with any given phase, and suggest ways of dealing with them. Whenever possible, I shall let the children speak for themselves. If any one period of the life of an individual were to be singled out for its greatest significance in its total emotional adjustment, there would be little disagreement that the preschool years should be selected. It is indeed during the four or five years which follow infancy that the child's character develops its basic, highly individualized form, that which stamps him as different from other individuals, and makes it possible to predict his emotional responses, and also to be able to predict his behavior and social adjustment under any given circumstances in later years. In that relatively short span of years, his emotional growth is rapid and all decisive. Under the guidance and with the model of parents and parent substitutes, he learns to control his instinctual urges to comply with social demands. He learns to give up many gratifications in exchange for positive values, which at the time, it must be said, do not seem to him so positive and are felt as sacrifices. Whether the relinquishing leads to constructive and normal ways of development, rather than neurotic ones, depends to the largest extent on the kind of love approach the parents, especially the mother, are capable of offering, and this in turn is dependent upon their own adjustment as individuals and parents. Let us see what changes are taking place. The child becomes gradually independent of his mother, physically and emotionally, and establishes relations with his peers and adults outside of the family, the nature of which is contingent upon the degree of security he enjoys with his own family. The physical closeness, the mothering, the maternal protection, which were so important during the first year, and to a lesser extent a second year, are gradually relaxed. The child walks, runs, climbs, is eager to explore the world, what of the world is offered to him in his home, at the playground, or the nursery school. The maturing of his nervous system goes on at a fast pace. His motor coordination, at first of large, then of small muscles, shows rapid improvement. It is sometimes difficult, at this time, for the mother to give her child the amount of freedom which will encourage motor activity unanswered by fear and satisfying to the child. The dangers involved here are much less than usually anticipated, and the few prohibitions necessary in order to protect the child can be formulated to him in simple terms, without any undue emphasis on dangers of bodily harm, which can only be felt by the child as additional, unwarranted threats to his body integrity. Similarly, a child's confidence in his ability to do more and more things for himself can be bolstered up by his mother's willingness to let him try, or else it can be badly thwarted by the mother's constant interference, superfluous guidance, and untimely suggestions. On the one hand, frustration resulting from repeated failure before overwhelming tasks must be avoided. On the other, the feeling of helplessness, so characteristic of the infant, should gradually become past history. A mother, by virtue of her own early deprivations or later frustrations, for instance in her married life, may put excessive demands upon the child, or she may, on the contrary, allow such unrestricted freedom and indulgence as is conducive to anxious and hostile attitudes, rather than satisfaction for the child. A mother who is free of anxiety and neurotic drive seldom has any difficulty in striking a balance between the two extremes. The trial and error and personal experimentation approach is infinitely more gratifying to the child and more conducive to his normal growth than would be passive acceptance of the best planned schedule of activities closely supervised by his mother. The topic of motor function and muscle controls leads naturally to that of sphincter control. Bile control is achieved earlier than bladder control. And at two, many children are already bowel trained. However, even when this is the case, temporary regressions under stress, such as physical illness or emotional upheaval, are not uncommon and well within normal limits. Let it be said in passing that no functional development is achieved on a straight upward curve. There are fluctuations, forward and back, with a gentle upward trend. Bladder control is achieved for a day at approximately 18 to 24 months and for a night at three years. Elimination control deserves special consideration from the point of view of physiological readiness, symbolic significance, as well as far-reaching influences on the formation of character. It goes without saying that a child first must be physiologically ready. And yet, I have known several children whose mother or nurse instituted a tax on the elimination training beginning at birth. Such children were said to have been trained at three or four months, which does not actually mean training, but simulates it by virtue of development of rigid and regular patterns. The mothers of these children expressed great pride at these achievements, which they considered exceptional and which indeed they were. But the price paid in unhappiness and character distortions seemed to have escaped their reckoning. I need not go into the considerations of when to start elimination training, how to do it, and when to expect it normally to be achieved. Many publications are now available to the young and inexperienced mother. But the core of the problem is not one of schedule, rather of feeling relationships between two persons, a mother and her child. Freud, as is well known, was first to call attention to infantile sexuality and the pleasures experienced by the child through various parts of his body. In the age period under consideration, the oral region becomes less exclusively important, while the anal and the genital urinary areas gain in importance. It is also in the beginning of this period, two, three, four years, that the child becomes intensively curious about his own body, exploring it in every and all prominences and recesses, that he becomes aware of specific sensations associated with selective areas, that he becomes aware of sexual differences, that he is curious to know where he himself comes from and how babies are born. He entertains fantasies regarding babies being made as a result of eating certain foods, of being born by ejection through the rectum and other fantasies, and he is greatly puzzled. He may ask questions, tentatively, and these may be answered, and they may not. Again, he may not even ask questions because he is aware of an attitude of diffidence or even taboo on the part of the parents. Whatever the case may be, it is in the midst of this confusion that he is asked to give up the freedom of certain pleasurable sensations connected with excretion. In some powerful, though not articulate, way, the process involves doing the right, the good thing, that the person he loves, the person who means the most to him because of her love, devotion, and care, wants him to do. Thus, the concepts of good and bad have their dawn in the child's mind. If the mother is punitive or inconsistent, the child becomes distressed and may react in several ways. He may bend every effort to comply well and fast. He may rebel and become negative, both in the training situation and overall behavior. He may develop somatic difficulties such as constipation or feeding difficulties. Now, from this point on, we give up the formal presentation as I reason that perhaps it would be more appropriate on the whole. Now, parents are frequently disturbed by what they consider abnormalities in the training and elimination control. We must try and differentiate between these presumably presumable deviations, which actually are only temporary regressions. I have mentioned before that no development is on a straight upward curve, and this is the case here. When a child, however, continues to wet his bed until the age of five, six, and seven, one must become, if not anxious, at least curious as to why he does so. Regressions may take place under stress temporarily, but they may become, if they are lasting, very powerful and significant indexes of conflict. I recall a little girl who had been carefully trained at two years who had completely trained for bladder and who one day refused to go to the bathroom. From this point on, she would go into an attack of panic whenever she was in need of going to the bathroom. In going carefully over the background of this change in the child's behavior, the following was learned. The mother had married not the man she was in love with, but on the ground, somebody she did not care for. On one particular day, the child being then two years old, she met in the park this man whom she was to have married and with whom she was still in love. And the child apparently sensed there was something that was going on in her mother's mind without putting a name to it, of course. The mother was quite upset. It was shortly afterwards that the mother wanted the child to go to the bathroom in the park and the child had what she called a tempodendrum, but was an attack of anxiety, a panic. It was over a month that this child had been absolutely unable to avoid in the usual controlled way she had been able to develop. She would go as far as the threshold of the bathroom and there go into this attack. Stay for hours and as the hours spent were 15 hours without being able to empty her bladder. Now you see the kind of things that can happen to training, bladder training or bowel training under the stimulation of emotional upset. One other aspect of this, of the behavior of the child in the bathroom which disturbs parents is the use, their use in that period of bathroom terminology. How to handle that. It is my experience that the less is said at the beginning when the child first presents this behavior, the quicker the behavior goes. The child is interested in these words as interested in others, more powerfully perhaps, both because of interest in excretion, but also, and perhaps more, because of the anxiety it gives in his parents when he says these words. In relation to the bladder training, there was one special difficulty which attends to the girls. Girls go through a phase at three, four, between two and four years, through a phase of wanting to be boys. they make all kinds of trials at voiding in the way a boy avoids. And, for instance, a three-year-old girl after such a period of attempts was concerning herself with her failure by saying, won't it be nice when I'm a boy and I have one of those things then I can really be standing up. she was hopeful. It is during this period that children become aware of sex differences whether they go to nursery school or not. How they become aware of the sexual differences, it is difficult to find out exactly in the case of any one child but certainly the parents are there to exhibit such differences and the child will at this time ask questions. They must be answered. They must be answered simply, straightforwardly. Not in the way a scientist or an engineer would go into the description of the pedigies of the body and I say this because it has happened and I have heard it. but just ask the one question that the child asks and wait. You may ask another question then it's time enough to answer that particular question. in this period children very often behave in such a way and make such remarks as will substantiate and fully the description given by Freud of the Oedipus situation. As was referred to before I was engaged for some ten years in a research project on the development of personality in young children and one of the things that we were doing was to collect data through mechanical recording. Observations and so-called verbatim records can be distorted by the personality of the observer but the machine has no personality the machine takes everything down just as it is heard and let's see what these children say. a boy five-year-old engaged in the dress of game that all children love at this stage says, you know I am my mama's husband and a three-year-old girl sees her teacher's husband visiting the school in an officer's uniform and she announces to the group you know something Mrs. D has a daddy that big soldier is her daddy the child's mother was there and correct sir he's her husband she says the girl says no well he's her husband but grown-ups call their daddy their husband so you see children equate in their mind hundreds of such quotations could be given their father and their husband and the girls go through this phase of monopolizing their father as their husband and vice versa at this stage children are also concerned as I indicated before with how babies are born now here I would like to point out that the way to answer a child is vastly different from the way to answer an adult that seems right but I have again and again seen children who were highly confused by explanations given by their parents which would have been valid for an adult mind but which only brought confusion to a small child the tendency is to begin as one would with an adult with a beginning conception development of the child in neutral etc the child is not concerned with that he has a very concrete mind he appreciates the senses the world through his senses and what he wants to know is where does he come from that's the first question so where he comes from he comes from his mother's tummy or abdomen and for the moment that's all he will ask that's all he wants to know perhaps three months later or the next day he will ask something else but that's all he wanted to know instead of this somebody will start with the birds and the bees and the semen and the pollen and etc and I have I have had a positively ludicrous example of this in a play session with a child who was four years old and who was going around distributing seeds that he got from Africa and he was giving everywhere to people and things in order to grow babies he did not seem to be disconcerted by the fact that nothing happened however so one is reassured that he was waiting for a later time to learn something that he could grasp and emotionally get at this period also and in line with what I have already presented parents are sometimes disturbed by what they call rather freely masturbation genital handling which is subsequent to the discovering of this particular part of the child's body and the sensations attend to this is universal universal it may first be observed after two months or two years but it is universal what creates the problem is the attitude of the parents toward this exploratory gesture and this lingering over a part of the child's body which he feels is strange not to be mentioned not to be referred to well of course there are degrees of intensity and severity it's obvious that if a child is engaged in handling himself instead of playing something must be done about him but the general handling that is observed in young children is usually something that will pass fairly easily if not undue stress or taboos are placed on the child now I'd like to take up some behavior manifestations and habits which were normal during the infancy period and which in this period would represent immaturity or even evidence of conflict thumb sucking is one a very young child sucks his thumb to a large extent because he hasn't had enough sucking experience either at the breast or at the bottle the child must have a certain amount of sucking satisfaction which begins with birth he may be frustrated at the breast he may be frustrated at the bottle or for some other reason he hasn't had enough sucking experience and he begins to suck his thumb and do together with this all kinds of things which are called associated movements and which are usually the kind of movements that a child movements of the hand I'm talking about movements of the hand that a child would be showing when he's at the breast if such sucking persists in this period and toward the end of the period five six years it indicates a return to orality and oral satisfaction which should be considerably lessened during that period and which indicate tension in the child and again one should be if not anxious at least curious as to why the child must find satisfaction in an immature form of behavior rather than spontaneous play and games with his friends any rest as I have mentioned now temper tantrums so called temper tantrums the young child and I believe you have this period very thoroughly covered the young child very frequently evidences what would have to be described temper tantrum if it were taking place when he's five or six years of age if he feels frustrated if his bottle is empty and he's still hungry his whole body is engaged into mass movements rapid movements which are in the nature of the kind of motor behavior you find in temper tantrums temper tantrums so called in this age can represent several things they can be manifestations of anxiety they can be the outcome of frustration they can be also attention getting devices whatever may be the case one again should be curious about why a child goes into a so called temper tantrum whenever he feels frustrated other manifestations less common are the kind of pendule emotions that you find in infants if an infant is inactive he is awake but he's not being fed he's inactive he may go into a pendulum motion of one sort involving either the head or the body if he's lying down he may roll the head if he's sitting up or half sitting up he may rock the body or swing it pendulum fashion now these manifestations are not universal but fairly frequent in infants but when they appear or continue in this period one again one must be curious to investigate the background of such manifestations nightmares associated with anxiety are fairly common and I believe that there is no child I have known either in the normal group or among the children who came for treatment either at the clinic or in my own office I don't believe that there's one child who did not experience at some time at least one nightmare more frequently several but when it becomes a question of habits two or three nightmares a week for instance then it is again time to do something the dreams that the children have in that period and which are manifestation of their anxiety easily explain the possibility of nightmares children very often in that group at that age will dream that they are being chased or bitten by large biting animals they may be all kinds of animals but they have this one characteristic in common they go after them to bite them off of course there's the expression of the anxiety but here also there is a projection in the dream of the child's own aggression about which I'll say something further later on in relation to the anxiety of young children and the development of nightmares I would like to bring a word which is not directly tied up with this but which in the long run helps to ward off the fostering of anxiety I find that very often young children are dragged into one experience or another sometimes an experience which is a marked change in their routine without preparation it is very important for any child around that age to know in advance what's going to happen not necessarily in five minutes but in an hour or today or tomorrow especially if some change of significance is to take place an extreme example of that is that of a little girl two years old who was brought to me because she was doing what the parents or the grandparents in this case were considering very peculiar she would open doors and go back of doors to see what there could be so they thought what there could be in behind doors or in closets or drawers and the grandparents and the mother who were living together thought that this child was curious beyond the normal range well it was simple enough to find out what this child was looking for her father had been called to the army and he just had disappeared nobody had given an explanation to this child it seems difficult to believe but that's the fact this child had not been told that her father was going to leave the home that he was going to go to the army and what she was doing in these peculiar places was to look for her father now that may seem strange to us adults that a child should go into drawers and back of doors to find her father but when a child is that anxious he must compulsively look everywhere and a simple explanation of what has happened and when she could expect her daddy to be back in a rather vague sort of way of course put a stop to this peculiar behavior now about fears how what is the first tenet about fears and how to deal with them the first advice I would give is to recognize that there is a fear the tendency in many parents is to say there's nothing to be afraid of well perhaps there's nothing to be afraid of but what the child knows and what he feels is that his whole little body is trembling with fear there's something to be afraid of that he knows he doesn't know what first he must be reassured and given support that his parents on whom he kind of fear the child may be having and if this is of such great intensity as would make it difficult for the parents to deal with it psychiatric help must be sought in relation to the fears we find the so-called rituals of children you have all noticed that children three four years old are prone to take in strange situations but almost always at night in their bed fuzzy animals or some of them will take a little bit of wool which they plucked from their blanket and which they'll take everywhere these children are trying to get protection against their own anxiety they're trying to get some security out of this companion which doesn't abandon them during the night and I recall an eight year old girl who after some period of treatment acknowledged to me that she had ever since she was one and a half or two years old taken with her to bed a rather large teddy bear because she had had these dreams almost every night that some men were waiting for her to come in and take her and cut her up and this big teddy bear was going to be protection of course at eight years the teddy bear was no longer an actual physical protection she knew that but it had remained with her as a symbol in this period which as I have indicated before is a very significant period language development takes its greatest part and makes social relations possible on a communication basis and it has many emotional ramifications the first word we recall is associated with the mother and language can be an efficient or enjoyable tool or a source of frustration now let us see how this language developed in that period at first there are what are known as action words when a little didi says didi two years old she may mean five or six different things she may mean didi wants this she may mean don't you take this from didi she may mean didi wants her mother she may mean didi is afraid and what will bring the special connotation the special meaning is the general behavior the general attitude motor patterns and the affective tone which is associated with that one word children have a sort of logic which we do not reckon with as often as we should and just for the sake of division I'll cite some examples a four-year-old boy wanted to remove his rubbers in the court the ground was wet and the teacher said you see all the damp sand it isn't good for shoes what an unhappy word this child said is it good for rubbers I must say that the teacher did not have an answer for that one now children pick up expressions in the air to which they give meanings of their own and one would not be prone to feel that even atomic energy would creep into the vocabulary of four-year-olds but there it is one day a group of four-year-olds in the court and one asks anyone knows what atomic energy is one says well I know but I don't know and the teacher said well that's about the way I feel about it so the first boy who had just prepared this dramatic ground said I know I know what atomic energy is it's when you're strong that's atomic energy now we all are familiar with the kind of analogies that children create as they go along and which are very logical they'll say the good the best and the bestest and why not the smart and the smartest and here we have for instance an analogy in reasoning a child has picked up the expression 50 strong this was during the war and there was a good deal about the strong 2000 strong etc so so one boy of four asks another boy how brave are you the other boy says I'm 68 brave then he looks around evaluates his audience carefully and he says everybody here is 68 brave except Susie she's only 50 brave she was the only girl in the group now the child's speech during that period can as I have already indicated be encouraged in its development or quartered there is in particular this baby talk that some children not all exhibit most do which comes simply from the immaturity of their speech apparatus they omit consonants they distort consonants and some parents think it is cute and encourage it and encourage also the infantilization that this form of speech indicates it doesn't only hit the speech it hits all the whole behavior on the other hand some parents are prone to put pressure on children and ask them to perform particularly before strangers and especially if they are proud of the achievements in their speech language it must be recalled at this point that all children at the age of two or three present at some point or other what is known as developmental stutter this comes from a lag which exists between the pressure of words ideas and the inability of the apparatus to express these words and ideas so that almost not almost I say every child at some point maybe only once or twice but every child will go through this phase temporary phase of having a lot to say and not being able to put it across so what does he do sometimes he repeats a syllable or sometimes he blocks stuttering now this is what has started many real stuttering problems because the parents alarmed if they have noticed this so-called stutter will try and get the child to do all kinds of things such as slow down or be careful think of what you are going to say before you say a child of three and the child may react by blocking or showing what is known as chronic manifestations repeating words one must also recall here that children have not only individual rates of development but insofar as the total functions they have individual rates of development for each function what I mean by this is that a child may have walked very early and taught at only two and a half or three or vice versa or a child may be consistently precautious or a child may be consistently delayed there is no such thing as a consistent uniform gradual rate of development for all functions in all children in this early stage of the speech development a phase of negativism in behavior and a phase of overusing the word no comes up the word no is in a magic word when you agree with your mother and if you are two and three years old nothing happens but when you say no then things begin to fly and it is notorious that this is more a problem with girls than with boys because girls develop language earlier than boys so they start earlier to say no but one can well see that the word no would be almost a magic word to the child when he says no everything stops everybody pays attention to him he's taken for granted before but when he says no then he really becomes the center of things actually this period of negative behavior is a normal development not only is it a normal development that takes place when the child is about three years approximately three years old but if you follow a child say from two to seven and eight and you find that at no time this child has been negativistic and you should be concerned about him this is the first way of the child has to assert himself in front of the world not against the world but in the midst of his own world he can assert himself by being able to say no not only say no but be the first answer is no whatever routine is presented to him now this takes place variously between two and a half and four years when it has not turned up in that period then one child who is too passive and try and ascertain the reason why in this same age a problem which should not be a problem and is only because it is not understood is that of aggression the child the young child is normally aggressive and if one recalls that muscle and expression of aggression are intimately connected it's easy enough to see that one should not be concerned over the problem of aggression in the young child to a certain extent even activity is a form of aggression and certainly the attack of the young child on the outside world on his own world is aggressive behavior however sometimes associated with actual physical muscular aggression on persons as well as on things there are associated sadistic fantasies which disturb the parents now here's for instance a three year old and boy and girl the girl says daddy is the whole boss of this world because because god isn't the boy says my daddy is so big big big and tall he would hit the ceiling with his head and then it would all bleed it would bleed all over his hair that's what gruesome pictures that the children entertain very often the girl says I have a big big daddy the boy mine is taller when he grows up he will be bigger still now these aggressive fantasies often appear in the form of projection the favorite form of aggression in a child in that particular the first part of this period is his biting and here's what for instance a boy of four says indicating that if you're grown up you can give up forms of aggression which are dear to the child he says tomorrow is Lincoln's birthday he was a president of the United States that's his pronunciation the teacher says he was a very good man so the boy retorts yes he didn't even buy people did he going on to carrying the theme of the sadistic fantasy you note that children that age are using very freely death threats oh twenty times a day their best friend is being killed dead by them but death at that age doesn't mean the irreversible process that it means to the adult it means removal absence the person goes but the person may be brought back that is why incidentally absences must be explained to children particularly absences when I refer to the changes athletic place absences because absences are very often interpreted by death if the mother is temporarily away the child fears that his mother will not he's dead mother isn't there she's dead how this aggression should be handled well of course there are two things to remember one to protect the child the other to protect the other children or the equipment or the house in which he moved however there is protection and there is over protection if one begins to protect everyone and everything the child interprets this as nagging and blocking there are relatively few things that must be passed on to the child in simple words as to why you do not want him to do certain things you might hurt himself you might hurt other people other people do not like to be hurt at this age also characteristically we have what is known as an ambivalence of feelings in which love and hate can be present at the same time it's the time when the child says I want you I don't want you go away I love you I hate you how does the child deal with all these feelings these ambivalent feelings there is one very important mechanism that takes place and that's the identification identification with the parent identification is not mere imitation emotion when when a child identifies with his mother he or she is the mother at this point and anyone who sees a child behaves in a fantasy in a play as his mother knows what emotional experience this is for the child it isn't dramatics or histrionics it just is a going into the mother for the moment and these moments are frequent during the play not only with the mother with the teacher or with any other parent substitute at this stage again two and three the I not I differentiation takes place and this is stamped as it were by the first appearance of the correct use of the first personal pronoun a child two and a half will say he or she or you about himself a little later he will begin to use correctly the I and this is not only manner of speech it is also a deep differentiation which is taking place I am a whole person not like my mother not like my brother and so on it's very vivid and concrete this process of individuation is evidenced not only by the use of the pronoun but also coincident with this no appearance of the negative phase when the child says no he asserts himself he stands as a person against and in front of the other person Adler has stressed considerably the sense of inferiority which is encountered in the child there is no question that the child feels weak and small but it's interesting that of the hundreds of children I have heard in that stage I can't recall one who would say I'm too small to do that they'll play the two and three year old will play with the four and five will feel frustrated because he cannot do what the four and five year old does but he will not say I'm too small how does he deal with it he deals with it by expressing omnibotence he can do everything he's much bigger than the next one if he cannot himself assert that he's so big and so powerful then he identifies with his father or his older brother who he himself is going to be for his father child big and strong enough for him now let's see how this is expressed here's for instance here a four and a half year old boy and a three year old girl playing the boy insists that he has to have something first because I'm older than you are the girl who's very smart says not only because she has an IQ 150 the other one has also an IQ 150 but she says you see how she prepares her ground how old are you the boy says falls in the trap he says four and a half the girl with a triumphant tone says well I'm older I'm six her sister is six year old and you can see not only in this instance but many other instances noted during the day the identification with her sister now here's a group of three boys five years old Ted says I'm the strongest man in the world don't you hit Peter or I'll suck you John I'm the strongest man in the world I'll throw him away Ted Papa is the strongest man he's the best man and he never dies John who's not going to be beaten for that says no I'm the best man I'm the strongest all of these are really expressions in a very indirect and compensated way expressions of smallness weakness and inferiority here's more of it three year old girl says God is the biggest person in the whole world and you know who's the biggest man my daddy boy says another boy in the group he can't say that his father is the biggest because the other boy's father is the biggest so what is he going to say so he said well my daddy is hundred years old another one four years old says my daddy could lift up all school the girl four years old nearby says my daddy is biggest of all my daddy is a giant so the teacher asks well what is a giant girl they are bad people except my daddy really doesn't bite I'm just pretending he's a giant he's so big this is the stage in the individual development which is rightly described as narcissistic and egocentric and how narcissistic I will tell you a girl three years old says one day in the middle of play very solemn announcement I have two best friends in the world Tommy and me since Tommy is only sporadically a friend and she sends him away when he takes a toy of hers you can well see what's left me myself and I and that's about it a boy five years old breaks the toy of a girl about the same age she declares quite solemnly too I can't be friends anymore it's too much I'm friends with myself also at that age we find that a child must be right this is again a compensation for his feeling the feeling of inferiority which has been referred to before a child will justify anything he does by saying because it is because I do because I said because and that's enough because I said because he's never at a loss to explain or justify himself for instance a four year old boy who was just beginning to learn roller skating had great difficulty keeping upright on borrowed skates he was falling and creeping all the time and I recall the scene and I cannot help but laugh and he made this announcement to everyone around very cheerfully I'm getting to the place I wanted to he was on his belly at the time it's interesting that just as a child is never heard to say I'm too small to do this and this you almost never hear him say I don't know he'll always thought out as if he knew even though he knows actually from past experience that he's heading for failure in this in this period again as I have previously indicated socialization begins to take place it's the first time that the child is generally separated from his mother whether it's for first contact with other children whether he goes to nursery school or not it's interesting to watch their behavior at this age whether they will be preferably mingling with others and active in their play or preferring to be alone a child does a good deal of daydreaming at that age and there is nothing to be alarmed about it although some parents do feel alarmed about it daydreaming is to be concerned with only if it's so intense and lasts so much that it prevents the child from engaging spontaneously in play either play of his own or play with other children play indeed is the medium par excellence of the child's activity there is there are several functions which can be attributed to play in the young child one perhaps foremost is the pleasure of sheer activity anyone who has seen a child do his 12-15 miles a day on little feet knows that he must enjoy it because nobody asks him to he just loves to move another aspect of it is the mastery the learning to control the outside world another function and I wish I had time to go a little more at length into this aspect of it is the so-called abreaction of painful affect let me give you an example you will see a child for instance who is afraid of height pretend that he's on the edge of a wall again and again and again go over this wall and say you know what's going to happen if you go this way you fall down and you break your neck and he goes through this repetitively through this form of play again and again he also experiment with future experiences the home play the school play the doctor play is looking into the future into what might happen tomorrow or later on one aspect of the child's play that I am personally very much concerned with and puzzled by is that play and work in that age are interchangeable you see children building towers of blocks and saying impatiently let me work I'm busy with my work constructive play to them not destructive play but constructive play to them is work and work is play what is it that we do to children in our later formal education that makes them lose this the real fun and kick that they get out of building constructing something which they call either play or work I have mentioned before the fantasy fantasy in the young child as its function I have touched upon this but I'd like to mention here that a child is never taken by the reality possibility of reality of his fantasy a child knows that he pretends it's make believe at three years a child of normal intelligence knows very well the difference between fantasy and reality he may get involved into all kinds of dramatic themes but to him they are not real and if you want to see the proof of that you try and behave yourself as if this thing were real and try and take the measures that would be appropriate if that thing were real and you'll see if the child doesn't go into a panic at the thought that you have taken it for real he'll hasten to say no no it's make believe it's pretend it's only pretend I was only pretending the sense of reality in the child beginning with three years begins to gel as indicated by this ability to differentiate between fantasy and reality the so-called imaginary companions are as I've observed it much rarer if we mean genuine imaginary companions much rarer than one tends to hear in this group of children numbering over hundred there were only three children who exhibited so-called imaginary companions and are called imaginary companions companions people who are so real to the child that they have to behave as if they were real of course a child twenty times a day will say now teddy bear you eat your soup but he is pretending it isn't an imaginary companion and even if he carries this theme and this play this fantasy play extensively and repeatedly it still is not an imaginary companion an imaginary companion is a person who is fully created by the child and who has an existence of his own in the child's life usually and that was the case with these three children usually it is when the child is lonely and insecure and he doesn't find the kind of gratification in the reality world that he could expect in his family so he creates a sister for himself for a father or takes a teddy bear for a brother or sister mentioning the sister brings the problem which is frequently encountered at that stage the sibling problem this is the period in which most likely the child will have a sibling due to the modern conception of spacing the child has at best an ambivalent feeling toward the baby who is to come when he has been doled in advance and but often he's not even prepared and I want to give you from the record some indications that the child's real internal feeling is not always in accordance with his outside behavior his outside behavior has been frequently imposed upon him by the people who love him whom he loves and who he feels he must please he can't keep their love only if he's going to behave nicely to the baby but here's a four-year-old he has a baby sister when he's presented with this baby sister he looks at her thoughtfully and he says where's my hammer a three-year-old boy was playing with dolls and he found a pin he asked me do you need this pin I said no what do you want to do with it said I want it if you don't need it I could give it to my real baby he was playing with dolls which he pretended were his baby and he would want to take this pin to give it to his real baby this is a little more subtle than the hammer but it's there I'll say just one word about discipline because I see the term is getting short discipline of course is necessary and one of the greatest policies that parents can engage in is the complete freedom that is the sort of anarchy and which makes a child extremely anxious the child has a great need for consistency and even strictness if it is consistent is less damaging than inconsistent behavior the child has a real need of conforming and when I say conforming I'd like to differentiate conforming and conforming if you place children together and this experiment has been made incidentally in England and do not formulate any rules let them do as they will please they'll create their own rules and limitations on the other hand if the parent asks a child to conform that's a very different matter because this is not conforming in the sense of the child the way he understands it doing what the other person does when his parent asks him to do this because he doesn't feel at all that it is conforming he feels only that it is acquiescing to father's wish it's not the same thing not in his mind the nursery school in that sense is usually desirable not always available and perhaps its greatest qualification is that it takes the place of the large families that used to be and no longer are this is not a plea for large families in that age the role of the father becomes paramount partly because it easier for him to participate and to play with his child who has now a form as it were but also because the child especially the boy has a real drive to identify with his father and in a sense makes the job easier for the father now in finishing I would like to indicate that comprehensive tables on physical mental and emotional growth such as have recently been made available to the general public are useful but you will gather from my talk perhaps not as well organized as partly as it may have been that I feel that there is not only one rule for one and all children parents and educators should not become slaves to the tables because within a broad frame of reference which may be called normal there is still room for considerable individual variation in Victorian times it was customary to say that children should be seen and not heard I'd like to revise this and say stop look and listen you'll see a great deal you'll hear a great deal and you'll learn from the child his own story you'll not only have great fun but you'll also help him develop and not dwarf his school potentialities applause applause applause applause applause applause applause Thank you very much Dr. Despera applause applause Thank you very much Dr. Despera for your very interesting talk I am very glad to hear that my child is three years of age it is no different than any other child of three years of age she has that no complex very definitely I'm glad to hear that they can be expected doctor should foster parents tell their child that he is an adopted child if so at what age and how should they go about telling him would you come over the microphone please they certainly should tell their child that he is an adopted child and the sooner the better when I say the sooner the better obviously not six months or a year but as soon as the child is able to understand he must be told that he has been adopted but he must also be made to feel that he was not rejected love rejected I'm talking about now by his real parents since generally the parents the foster parents do not know under what circumstances the child has been quote abandoned it can always be said that the parents could no longer keep this child either somebody had died or because they were so poor they could not bring the child but the facts must be faced very early if for no other reason that the child could inadvertently hear it from other sources which would destroy completely the confidence into her parents or his parents thank you doctor and you spoke of a blanket or an animal as a comfort as I remembered it was something woolly that you said they liked to take to bed with them my three and a half year old this isn't mine the question is mine does also is devoted to his blanket and do you feel that he should be denied it should we take these little animals away no absolutely not glad to hear that then what do you think about the question of religion as a good disciplinary value in preschool age the question of religion I feel is entirely a family affair it's part the religious attitudes are part of the superego that the parents bring to the child what the child is going to identify with and it's the parents it's entirely to the parents to decide whether they will speak of God which of course the child will interpret as a personal entity or will bring religious principles and so on it is entirely a family concept and must remain so doctor would you consider bedwetting by a child of four something to be worried about now I know why they have so many good women in this problem of bringing up babies doctor I know men just can't we just can't handle these questions no four year old is not an age to be alarmed about especially if this is not done continuously this may refer only to sporadic weighing it's a little late but it's still on the edge of the normal how do you handle a very stubborn child I suppose there are a thousand different ways of doing it would you give one or two we all must have stubborn children I think I question that well one of the ways to handle a stubborn child is never to present him with a ready-made situation and throw him into it you try to present the situation you know very well about the situation but you try to present it to him as if he were choosing it really that's really the secret of making a child accept the situation that he doesn't want now let's do this okay you're going to do that with me alright you can't help us say yes for once apropos of a no period of a child's life should one give the child the satisfaction that's in quotes the satisfaction of reacting negatively he's going to take the satisfaction anyway but one of the ways of making the negative period last less is for the parents not to butt their own will against the child's will because the child will win rather personal question doctor should a mother who is 43 and has a child who is six years old have another child well this is more perhaps more a question to be answered by medical men I'm also a medical person but I have long since forgotten obstetrics and before the question of emotional readiness comes in it seems to me that the question of physical readiness should be taken up very carefully with a medical man all right thank you I notice although you are a doctor you're awfully careful you're very nice to notice that if a child of two bangs his head on the floor because he wants his own way what should we do about it I think almost any way would be better than we'll stop the banging but I suspect that there may be more complex problems than just banging the head in response to frustration and one should be curious to know what is back of this the child may feel rejected the child may feel he's not paid enough attention to for a variety of reasons he feels anxious and frustrated in some way that I can tell all right doctor thank it problem of divorce now a child of five the question you writes in here a child of five whose parents are divorced and have remarried well this child says that she has two daddies and much more lucky than her friend who only has one daddy how should the situation be explained to her that's a practical problem well this is a parallel to the comments I was taking from the children themselves they don't that's what it is it's better to have two daddies only because their child feels unhappy about being different that's a compensation mechanism and I think that this child probably should be explained gently why the parents had to divorce the father loves him as much something has happened whatever it was between the parents which made it impossible for them to continue but the father lacks as much and certainly the love of the father cannot be the same in the eyes of the child as the love of the real father the child is compensating here is there any significance when a four-year-old girl wants to wear its parents shoes all over the house and play and wear its parents clothes and how about when a child hides somewhere and seems to get great joy out of its being sought it mentions here it's a girl yes a girl or boy it would be the same I think that perhaps girls have more of a tendency to dress up it probably is leading to the histrionics of the future however putting putting your mother's shoes on is not unusual all children go through that of course when a boy for instance repeatedly and until five and six years wears his mother's shoes one needs to be perhaps not alarmed but one needs to go into what the significance may be neurotic pattern for some reason the other one is also a very common game of the child in fact he doesn't only play it with his parents but he plays it with himself or with a little playmate the joy of being found that's quite right he wants to be found he likes to he's abreacting he likes to go through the throes of being lost and being rejected because each time he finds his parents again that's a game all right doctor what can one do about two and a half year olds who fear loud noises and continue to insist that I am a tiny baby this is a this is a baby this is a child who wants to remain a baby the slip was quite in accordance with the facts I don't know what the reason may be but this child wants to remain a baby may have a little brother or sister and he wants to be regressing to that child to the baby's level but anyway he wants to call and retain the attention and love of his mother as a baby doctor should we be curious or anxious about a boy of six who very frequently asks would you kill me or would you kill my teacher and so forth yes I would if the child says it in a play a rather gruesome sort of play and a little beyond the age at which these sadistic fantasies appear but if he does it with feeling and he seems to take it seriously I certainly would be concerned I certainly would want to know what the meaning of this is would you would you feel at all concerned about a child of three who frequently announces mommy I love you and said at least several times a day you think that's natural doctor well three times a day is definitely natural all right if the child were continually asking do you love me or repeating I love you I'd wonder why she wants to say that what can a mother do to help a child who stutters what can a mother do to help a child who sucks his thumb to help a child who stutters it would depend on the age because if the child stutters at one and a half or two years it may be a prolongation a new prolongation of the normal so-called normal stuttering developmental stuttering however if this child is six seven years old the only thing to do is to seek help go to the nearest psychiatric clinic and find out why the child has to stutter the sucking of the thumb doesn't indicate what age if it's a two year old I wouldn't give a second thought to it if the child is five and six and spends his time sucking his thumb instead of playing yes I would seek psychiatric help if he sucks his thumb just before going to sleep or just to comfort himself I wouldn't give it a second thought doctor the questioner here has a child that continually looks behind doors and looks in closets just as you described the child did in this particular case this two year old's daddy has not gone to the army and nobody close to him has left do you attach any significance to that or well this child is looking for something I would have to know a good deal more about the youngster to know what the significance of this seeking may be it is very often tied up with sexual curiosity which may have been stimulated in this case I don't know for instance a two year old may have heard unidentifiable noises at night he wonders what his parents are doing and one of the ways he can find out is to try he thinks is to try and go into inside of things inside a radiator inside a radio inside a closet inside anything just see what's going on inside is there a difference between instincts and drives as manifested in the child and if so what's the difference this is a lecture in psychology that I am asked and I won't I think I won't take it up I'll just indicate that drives are could not be identified with instincts drives are push instincts are there's something which exists in the child at birth which I found myself in great difficulty in explaining this in rather simple terms which Freud has put under the category of id the instinct to the instinctual urges which are found in the very young child at birth let's leave it at that because I don't want to go into the whole discussion all right doctor assuming there's no physical reason how can a parent determine psychological problems bothering a child of seven who bed wets at night is there any way a poor parent can do this I mean we all can't go to psychologists and check on every little trouble of our child how can a parent do about that well it is true that there are not enough psychiatric clinics to go around but there are psychiatric clinics and in the case of a seven year old bed wetter the urgency may not be such that one could not wait until the child came up on the waiting list that's what I would suggest that the nearest clinic be approached of course in the meantime doctor it may be a little while go by and that bedwetting would still be going on well but what else is there to be done the only thing the only answer I know of is to seek psychiatric help and if the child were in an acute situation I'm sure that he would be rushed up the list but if it is mildly chronic condition as would be the case here I'm sure then perhaps an interview can be sought and then a waiting will have to take place doctor I sometimes wonder any of us grow up at all it's so complicated to get a child up out of the three or four year olds maybe we don't of course should I be worried if my three and a half year old boy still demands a bottle of milk at bedtime not at all not at all he'll give it up can sibling jealousy be avoided even with the best preparation what is the best preparation for sibling harmony the best preparation for sibling harmony is parental harmony I'd like to answer this by going off a little bit and saying that in this research project when we studied these hundreds of children we could always tell in advance who would present a sibling rivalry problem preparation or no by the judging from his degree of security in relation to his parents it is always dependent upon the security that the child feels with his parents and that was a hundred percent record I say that without any modesty because it was a very simple matter to draw the conclusion it was always checked Dr. Desperer you didn't mention nail binding will you refer to it in the younger ages mention the cause too as a matter of fact I had it mentioned in conjunction with thumb sucking I was running through the notes rather rapidly because of time but nail biting is more often than not a substitution a more aggressive substitution I must say of thumb sucking very often nail biting appears when thumb sucking has been radically stopped it is a form of oral regression it is not similar in to thumb sucking in that it doesn't bring the kind of oral satisfaction that thumb sucking does it's more aggressive a manifestation but it's very frequently I would say three quarters of the time it comes from thumb sucking being stopped abruptly doctor would you comment on a child that gets up several times it says three times every night either to go to the bathroom or for a bottle this child is anxious about something he may be anxious about what's going on during the night outside of his room and doctor how about a child that insists on sleeping with the lights on and every time you go to turn the lights off wakes up and says I can't sleep in the dark well this is a child who is anxious and who probably has frightful dreams the child who doesn't want to go to sleep in the dark is usually expecting things to happen in the dark and the things that throw a paw a tooth at them how should a person deal with the anxious child who carries a piece of cloth with him as a constant companion I don't know how old this child is but I would say I would say that the only thing to do is to let him have it because it has a meaning and short of doing something about the anxiety which prompts him to want this security to hold on short of that I think let him have it but one could do could find out what is going on too this child is anxious doctor at what age is a child best able to adjust to a new baby I think four or five years let's put it this way last last week four or five is a better age than two or three at two or three the child has great difficulty in relinquishing his mother and he also is still in the throes of this oral aggression which could have rather devastating effects on the arrival of the baby dr could explain, well, that she probably pretends, or he probably pretends. If this is a six- or seven-year-old child who is presenting a fantasy as real, well, of course, it's another story, because perhaps this six- or seven-year-old child is upset and has, as a manifestation of his emotional difficulty, a so-called pathological lying or pretending with such a degree of reality that it has a meaning to him. How can you stop a child of about 20 months who is starting to bite? One should he be stopped, and two how? Well, he's going to stop. I wouldn't worry. If he has just started to bite, give him a chance, just a few dozen bites. Doctors are always so nice, and they give you such a pleasant feeling. I mean, they could go right ahead and bite for a little while. Well, Dr. Despair, thank you very kindly. This has been sort of woman's night here, lady's night. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
