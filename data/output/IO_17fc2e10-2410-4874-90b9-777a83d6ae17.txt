I greet my fellow citizens of the Jewish faith on the occasion of this new year, 5712, which again marks your consecration to the religious ideals of Judaism. You ought to be congratulated on the vigor and determination with which Israel is meeting and overcoming its present problems and the growth of the Jewish state as a stronghold of democracy in the Middle East. I pray that during the times ahead, all of us will successfully meet the challenge of totalitarian aggression and assure the men of goodwill the freedom which we have established here in the United States.
