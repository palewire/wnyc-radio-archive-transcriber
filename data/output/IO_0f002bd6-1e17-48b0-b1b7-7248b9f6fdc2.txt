I got my gal, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gal, got my gal, got my love, got my song. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's ready for me. I can't the sun, can't the moon, can't the people see. The folks with plenty of money, got to pray all the day. Keep the plenty, don't have to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away, I am a friend of hell, in a time of life. Never want me long, and I'm well, never want me strive to be gone, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm the Lord? Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's ready for me. I got my gal, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Got my gal, got my gal, got my love, got my love. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've Got Plenty of Nothing, from Gershwin's Poggy and Bess. The choristers are under the direction of Florence Marderosian, with Isabelle Labori as piano accompanist. The choristers are under the heaviest winds, and again, I was very efecto of 사용. Thank you. You can't find me because you want wrists at Gershwin's looks. Whatever I can ober my goal for is to be done with you, you can find a place where you think about how you and your genres. Just how you're going through the play. Join the other side of the dining room, you can find yourself through, just how you know your chance. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
