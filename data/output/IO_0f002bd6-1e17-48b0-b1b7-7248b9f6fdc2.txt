We hear first, The Banks of Allen Water, followed by Now is the Month of Maying. The Banks of Allen Water, where the spring springtime may fall, On the village's lovely daughters, parents of them all, For it's dry, a soldier's summer, and a willing tongue and ear, On the banks of Allen Water, not all day and year. The Banks of Allen Water, where the northern spread is so, There is love on the hill and store, but she's blinded by the no more. For the summer, the Greek and water, and the soldier, folks, not he, On the banks of Allen Water, not all day and year. The Banks of Allen Water, where the winter snow fell by, Till the streets of the miller's door, And the chilling blues of land. From the miller's door, from the miller's door, From the miller's door, and the careless spring. From the banks of Allen Water, where the north lake is.

And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bats, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Borey, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. Gershwin's Porgy and Bats Oh, I love plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The coast is plenty of plenty, found a lot on the door. Great somebody's a-goin' to run, but without a-make-in-more. What for, what for? I've got no mule on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the sky, are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my song, the head is a-whole-day-long. Do you complainin'? I've got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I can't go sun, can't go moon, can't go deep to see. The coast with plenty of plenty, got to pray all the day. Keeps the plenty, don't worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time of ride. Never want me long, and I'm well. Never want me strive to be gone, to be bad. What the hell, are you glad I'm the Lord? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got my gal, got my song, the head is a-whole-day-long. Do you complainin'? I've got my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Beth.
