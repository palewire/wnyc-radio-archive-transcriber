The name of the mayor. Obrig geezers saw this part of Angelina, Maus Zieh and erst in Northanger and a decisive 44-Lone Ranger and Mr. Salazar. deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life, I salute you and the people of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Several weeks ago, I had the honor to entrust to Deputy Mayor Scurney of Genoa during his visit here the scroll for distinguished service presented to you by the citizens of the City of New York. I am pleased indeed to felicitate you personally and to formally give you this brief expression of New York's admiration for so distinguished a visit. And Mayor Pertuzio, may I personally, and in behalf of the people of the the City of New York, the City of New York, the City of New York, that I represent on this occasion, in recognition of your great contribution to the cause of democracy, particularly in your great fight in upholding democracy as opposed to communism in your own native city of Genoa, may I, for those things and all the things that you stand for in advancing the cause of democracy not only in Italy, but throughout the world, expressed to you through this presentation of the City's Medal of Honor, the appreciation of the people of the City of New York for your services for mankind. Mayor Impeletere is pinning the Medal of Honor, the City's Gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at the City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Vittorio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. And now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. Honorable Sindaco of New York, it's with profound commotion that I've heard your words affectionate and cordial revolving to my modest person and to the noble city that I've here honored to represent. legal You have It's legal very and it's incredible that the man has a unique meaning, but there are some things that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Europe and is coming to my city, she did not have only made a good visit to all of us, she also gave an homage to the city-mother of Cristoforo Colombo and this was sent to the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is coming to Genova ambasciadora of democracy, of that democracy that is so expensive to the United States, but that is so expensive, so expensive to the Italians, especially the Genovese. Thank you. So this visit is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesy, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States, and its own mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and in Italy. this privilege would also be heldolph Sout fromgesting in Belarus, of course, for the громpden of the United States of America for the country it is worth drinking, the exposure to this Уme and theLE 예�ine people from the United States, the United States and the World Ừ act, the marketplace of the United States, which we are deeply grateful for, because we know all the sacrifices that this people have made up for us to give us democratic libertarian freedom when we have intervened so in the war and to protect them today with many material sacrifices and men, so today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocination of democracy and have operated intelligently to defend democracy in Europe and to defend it in all the world. And, onorevole Impeliteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work, because democratic libertarian freedom is really estes to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. Not easy, our challenge, for a time we don't understand it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just when we were we were trapped by the weight of the conflict. We were lost in the city of Città-Care, territory in which our work could be exploited, misery and ruin, but the attack of this force, this faith democratic democratic freedom was so alive that we have taken our work, we have worked, we work, we desperately work for to rebuild our country moral and materialize our country. It is with these sentiments, onorevole Impeliteri, that I salute you and the city of New York and I tell you that we are tenacious in the work of the reconstruction of democracy in our country. We are tenacious and we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genoa, the tenacious of Colombo in searching for your own land. It is an example to all the genoveses. Deriso, not creduto, contrastato da ogni avversità, dagli uomini e dagli avvenimenti, ques'uomo sapeva che questa grande terra esisteva e l'ha cercata disperatamente, and and and and sondando alle focidi e ai fiumi, and and cercando negli estuari, ovunque cercando quel passaggio che lui voleva trovare per congiungere tutto il mondo sotto la croce cristiana. Christian, and not matter if he then has found the passage, not matter if each one of us doesn't find the passage, if you persist, others will find the way, the way that everyone will be free in peace and in the work. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts and deeds which have a significance in themselves and are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to Genoa, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend and as a symbol of all you stand for and of all what New York and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which mean so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. I believe, we all believe, that in spite of all difficulties, we shall win. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first, but in the end, we shall succeed, we shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. We will now be entertained with some selections by the Police Department Glee Club. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. THE END La la la la, it's an old Italian phrase, la la la la la.
