Here the tramples, Saxon-Homens, Saxon-Spearmen, Saxon-Homens, Be laid eyes, or hide, or yaw-men, Played the white-the-ground. To the folds of thunder, Flag we conquer under, Flag we conquer under, The world is under. From which the country needs us, He is brave as he who leads us, Honor tells how proud he has done, Freedom, God, and Christ. Dwarf is the last is narrow, Flash with fear and slight of harrow, Fluid danger of death or sorrow, Death is glory now. Earl the reeling, Heart, men, over, Let the earth, gentlemen, cover, When a friend, a wife, a lover, Cremble on the floor. Hands of life are risen, Go for glory given, With glad you're not seeing a world of God, And living to heaven. Men of our lives, young for glory, Would you win a name in glory, Strike for hope, for life, for glory. Freedom, God, and Christ. For their third and concluding number, The Glee Club presents Benny Havens, A ballad sung by sons of West Point For over a hundred years, And sung today wherever West Pointers gathered. Come fill your glasses alone, And stand up in our row, To singing sentimentally, We're going for to go, In the army there so dry at feet, From motion very slow, So we'll sing our grand Millicent's head, Of Benny Havens' foes. O Benny Havens' foes. O Benny Havens' foes. O Benny Havens' foes. O Benny Havens' foes. We'll sing our reminiscence there, Of Benny Havens' foes. O Benny Havens' foes. We'll sing our reminiscence there, Of Benny Havens' foes. We'll sing our reminiscence there, Of Benny Havens' foes. To our kind old alma mater, Our rock-bound island home, We'll cast back many upon regret, As for life's feet we roam. Until on our last battle's fears, The lights of heaven shall show. We'll sing our reminiscence there, To the great new world, And Benny Havens' foes. O Benny Havens foes. O Benny Havens foes. O Benny Havens foes. We'll sing our reminiscence there, Of Benny Havens foes. May the army be augmented, so more than we let flow. May our country in the hour of need be ready for the fall. May the time that soldiers let them face, we let soldiers go. We'll throw him up, teach thy heart's name, for many havens hope. O many havens hope, O many havens hope. We'll sing our rest, many havens hope. From West Point, we conclude this quarter hour of song by the Cadet Glee Club, conducted by Cadet G. S. Harper, with warrant officer Barry Drews in charge, and Cadet W. S. Fisher, pianist. On Tuesday, June 4th, at 10 a.m., the address of Secretary of War Patterson to the graduating class will be broadcast over station WNYC. This is Major Bill Hood speaking and returning you to the studios of the Municipal Broadcasting System. Do you think it was left in Rome the Boeing Federal seat? I'd like to beret in the US, yet more humble to test birds are helping 만들 수 at the cost of something such as death. Please, President Uña read the story, and give a serenade of students to catch their lost, Aaah Pha. It has been 300 years of welcome that we have in the Borough of Brooklyn. In this Borough, we gather many nations of many nations all over the world. We live all happy together, no matter what race we come to, no matter what our religion is. God has given us that feeling that we shall continue to love each other, irrespective of our religion and our politics, as long as we are all good fellows together. I say in this great Borough, in 300 years, it has developed, and it has been an inspiration for the whole world. Those who have never had the chance to see our great Borough, I only come here to see our tall buildings, our great manufacturers, our many things of the interest that help supply the good things all over the world. Oh, people, when the opportunity comes to you, kindly visit our Borough. We are the Borough of good-hearted people, good-natured people. No drive was ever started in the Borough of Brooklyn that ever fell down. This Borough has been generous in everything. Warfront drives, Red Cross drives, Warfront drives, Cancer drives, and many, many others, and many, many others, because the people of Brooklyn were always generous, and they give, they give them out to this hunger famine all over the world. And I hope the world in return won't take advantage of us, as has been done on many occasions, but love and enjoy the friendship, not alone of the Borough of Brooklyn, but the good people that come from all parts of the world to make our country what it is today. And Brooklyn is one of the springs in our country that has developed, and we in Brooklyn are very, very proud that we are residents of this Borough. I thank you. Now, Pete, you've committed a grave error. You haven't said a word about Greenpoint. Well, I wanted to be a little modest. I want to feel this way, that to me, Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world. It is a spot where I was raised and first seen the light of day. At number 132, Eagle Street, thanks be to God there was a Greenpoint. Thanks be to God that the light of day gave me my opportunity. And to the people of Greenpoint, I worked and worked the same as every other man, and labored on the docks. I pulled lumber. I worked in the whole of vessels. I'm proud of you. I was a long shaman. I'm delighted to say that I worked with men, and I've done the same thing as every other man done. Worked for an honest living, and thanks be to God for that. Thanks be to God. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more, and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building housing of Borough President. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836, and then a depression set in. It lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected in 1848. That building was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land, which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there, on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down, and we're going to build $11.5 million Kings County Supreme Court building. Then you go down a little further, and we're going to have a brand-new post office site. The old post office building we're still going to keep there, and we're going to renovate that and use it there. We're out of a car. In other words, thanks a lot. We're here at Brooklyn, at Borough Hall. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary.

When you go down a little further, we're going to have a brand-new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there, and we're going to renovate that and use it for a federal court. This whole Brooklyn Civic Center is going to be flanked on both sides by public buildings, and right in the center of it, it's going to be a war memorial, and it's going to be a useful one instead of brick, lime, lumber, and cement. It's going to be an honor of the 327,000 boys and girls who fought in this war. And don't forget, Brooklyn supplied more, and that 327,000, and any of 39 states in the Union. In this war memorial, you're going to have an auditorium that holds 1,500 people, and then you're going to have a room on the right where the trophies that our boys captured from the four corners of the world are going to be on display. Then on the left-hand side is going to be a room in bronze where the names will be inscribed of every boy and girl who made the supreme sacrifice. And downstairs, this is very interesting, and I believe you'll like it. We're going to have a room for each of the veterans' organizations, which isn't anywhere in the city of New York. We're going to have the American Legion, the King's County, the Spanish War veterans, the Catholic War veterans, and the Jewish War veterans. They're all going to be down there in that one building source. Any of these 327,000 veterans needs assistance. They'll have a central location point to which to go. Thank you. I appreciate you very much, Mr. President, your busy life, stepping by this way and taking a few moments. That was quite a celebration you had down at Hamilton Ferry, wasn't it? Do you want to say a word about that? Yes, that was a big thrill. I'll tell you a little about that. A ferry boat, known as the Moran Thugboat Company, supplied it as a company. Well, he lives in Brooklyn, and he's a resident. I wonder if we can pick up somebody here, will you? I shouldn't say pick up, that's the wrong term. He's a new boat. I was walking across the square with Pete McGinnis sometimes, very athletic young man shook hands with him, and he says, How are you, he says. He lost and delivers a chance. Wow! Obviously, try to out-and-it writer Ben韓 Here is some cit sauce that he taught. But why don't I put all the thrill in shopping order? I try this along, and I'm really glad to ask hoody music today. Now he's come along, and we can enter one of his Jake's picking, use andreckled movies today, and hopefully, date weather & drink in Premier League. So I get that opportunity to win.
