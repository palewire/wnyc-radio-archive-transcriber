The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the song, I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, babe Goodbye, darling I must need you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tell me I am near the end Tells me I am near the end I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on, now, sound. Way, way, down south. Where the sun shines every day. Soft eyes of blue shine down anew. And all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along. Come on, join in the song. Jump on, body. It won't be long. We're on our way. It's pit for rain. We're going down south. Hooray. And since makes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the night I've hung up. Wandering, darling, is your true. Distance only lands and shone lands. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. One of us is that she won't be long for you. Like,essa,a,b broadcasting and intu 보니까 are above the sun. She was happy till she met you, and the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, you will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother, just because there is no other. She'll be happy till her old sweet home. When the harvest days are over, yes, it is, I just see. When the harvest days are over, yes, I'm so pleased. We stand so clear. You will keep the word you said, that's the time we do shall wear. When the harvest days are over, yes, it is, I just see. The harvest days are over, yes, it is, I just see. The harvest days are over, yes, it is, I just see. The harvest days are over, yes, it is, I just see. The harvest days are over, yes, it is, I just see. The harvest days are over. The harvest days are over, yes, it is, I just see. The harvest days are over, yes, it's lovely.
