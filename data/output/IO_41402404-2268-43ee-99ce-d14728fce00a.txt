Today the Salvation Army commemorates its 31st annual Prison Sunday. In 1,200 penal institutions throughout the United States, the Army of Peace, with its brilliant flags, its uniforms, and its sounding brasses, has brought its message of friendship and goodwill to thousands of men and women, many of whom have half forgotten, if they ever knew, the meaning of goodwill and friendship. Tonight, Station WNYC brings you the Salvation Army's Brooklyn Citadel Band and male chorus in a program of Salvation Army music, under the direction of Captain Edward Lowcock. They will start their broadcast with a Salvation Army march, victors acclaimed by Lieutenant Colonel Bramwell Coles. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ You just heard the Brooklyn Citadel Band of the Salvation Army playing the march victors acclaimed. As its next number, the band will play a meditation based on two hymn tunes. Oh, love that will not let me go, and Master, let me walk with thee. ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ ¶¶ There is one hymn that makes the blood tingle as few songs are able to do. It's a hymn that we often associate with the Salvation Army. The Brooklyn Citadel Chorus, directed by Walter Orr, will sing, Onward Christian Soldiers. Onward Christian Soldiers. Onward Christian Soldiers, onward Christian Soldiers. Marching on to war. Marching on to war. Who's come to Jesus, who has gone before. Christ, the royal master, leads against the foes. Forward into battle, sing his banners all. Sing it better, call. Onward, Christian, soldier, Looking unto Jesus, Who is gone before. At the name of Jesus, Satan holds the flea, Onward, for soldiers, Until victory. Hell's foundations quiver, At the shot of grace. Comrades lift your voices, Love your anthem, praise. Onward, Christian, soldier, Lunging as to war, Looking unto Jesus, Who is gone before. Like a mighty army, Through the Church of God. Somers we are treading, Where the saints have gone. We are not divided, Our one body, we've won in hope and a friend, One in charity. Onward, Christian, soldier, Watching unto Jesus, Looking unto Jesus, Who is gone before. Looking unto Jesus, Who is gone before. Here in the studio this evening, Is the head of the Salvation Army Women's Prison Bureau, Major Dorothy Berry, Who will tell you something about her work. Major Berry. Thank you, Mr. Child. Nearly 60 years ago, William Booth, our founder, Said in writing of the Salvation Army's work Among convicted persons, Our people, thank God, Have never learned to regard a prisoner As a mere convict, With a number instead of a name. To us, he is a human being. To be cared for and looked after As a mother looks after her ailing child. I suppose that was a rather appalling statement Back in the 19th century, When a prison sentence was pretty generally regarded As society's quite justifiable vengeance On those who had broken its laws. However, things have changed since then And are still changing. Each year we recognize more clearly That the purpose of our institutions Is not to get even with those Who have broken our laws Or to frighten them into obedience. Rather, we must help them become useful, Contented human beings. And strangely enough, As our psychologists and case workers And penologists increase their understanding Of the terrible loneliness, The sense of being cut off From all warm human ties Which causes the delinquent To turn against society, They come steadily closer to agreeing With the ideas of William Booth. They recognize the delinquent Needs to be recognized in an individual Who can be reached and helped By patient good sense and understanding. In the eleven states of our eastern territory There are two hundred and twelve penal institutions Which our officers visit at least once a month Holding religious services And interviewing all those who want help and advice. Often, too, we are called into court When a prisoner needs help Or to be put in our care. We also have in our charge Throughout the country Hundreds of paralys Whom we supervise And for whom we find work and lodgings. We do all these things Knowing if they are to have any real and lasting value We must somehow win the trust and confidence Of these people In such a way that we can help them To a better relationship with their fellows And to the deeper religious understanding Which we believe must be the source Of spiritual regeneration and growth. Thank you, Major Berry For what you've told us about this great work Of the Salvation Army. And now, the Brooklyn Citadel Band Directed by Captain Edward Lowcock Will play The Star Lake March by Eric Ball. The Star Lake March by Eric Ball The Star Lake March by Eric Ball Will be the Star Lake. The Star Lake March by Eric Ball Will be the Star Lake March by Eric Ball Will be the Star Lake March by Eric Ball The End The End The End The End This is the Salvation Army's Prison Sunday. I'm going to ask Major Berry once again to step to the microphone to tell us what this day means to her and to fellow officers and to the men and women in penal institutions throughout the nation, whom they have reached today. Major Berry. The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End First of all, I think Prison Sunday brings proof to delinquents of all ages that they are remembered. For many of them, the closing of the prison doors means that the normal outside world grows misty and vanishes. I think it does them good to realize that in every major institution in the country, and in many smaller ones, our people come to them, not judging or condemning, not condescending, not even pitying, but with warm goodwill and friendship, and a very sincere wish to share the courage and hope that comes through religious experience. Some 200,000 men and women have had an opportunity to attend our services today, and perhaps half of them will actually be blessed by it. For some, it may be the renewal of earlier contacts. For others, their first meeting with our people. To our officers, Prison Sunday brings one of the greatest opportunities for service during the year. Though we cannot free the bodies of the men and women to whom we speak, we can, if they wish it, help free their minds. And thank you once again, Major Berry. And now the Brooklyn Citadel male chorus, directed by Mr. Walter Orr, will sing the much-loved hymn, Rock of Ages. Rock of Ages Rock of Ages Let me hide myself in thee Let the water and the blood From thy wounded side with blood Be of sin Be of sin The half of pure Save from wrath And make me pure While I draw While I draw This bleeding breath When my eyes Shall close in death When I rise To worlds unknown See thee on Thy judgment throne Rock of Ages Yes Cleft for me I will hide Myself in thee That, of course, was the beautiful Rock of Ages Sung by the Brooklyn Citadel male chorus Directed by Mr. Walter Orr Now the Brooklyn Citadel band Of the Salvation Army Will play the Crusaders hymn Beautiful Savior You often see in the incomayan Messiah Mother E十 That is the name yeah What a way THE END THE END THE END THE END THE END And now we're going to hear more of the Salvation Army stirring battle music, the Staple Hill March, written by Captain Hector Main.
