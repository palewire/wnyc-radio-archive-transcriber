Wave on wave, and surging follow, Travels, hills and spout. Here the tramples, Saxon-Holmen, Saxon-Spearmen, Saxon-Comen. Be they nice, or high, nor yomen, They they'll fight the ground. To the falls of thunder, Flag we conquer under, The land that tries, the sky's the light, The world is under. From where the country needs us, He is brave as he who leads us, On a self, how proud he has done, Freedom, love, and rise. To the andes of the land. The sea's the fastest narrow, Flash with spear and fight a harrow, Fluid danger of death or sorrow, Death is glory now. Earl the reeling, harkmen, o'er, Let the earth, gentlemen, cover, When a friend, a wife, a lover, Cremble on the floor. Hands of life are risen, Flow for glory is given, With glad you're passing, A fulgur's feet, And waving to heaven. To the land of heart, Young for glory, Would you win a name in glory, Strike for hope, for life, for glory. For glory, Freedom, love, and rise. For their third and concluding number, The Glee Club presents Benny Havens, A ballad sung by sons of West Point For over a hundred years, And sung today, Wherever West Pointers gather. Come fill your glasses, fellows, And stand up in the row, To singing sentimentally, We're going far to go. In the army there's so dry at feet, From motion very slow, So we'll sing our grand, Millicent's head, Of Benny Havens hope. Oh, Benny Havens hope, Oh, Benny Havens hope, We'll sing our grand, Bendisent's head, Of many havens home To our kind old alma mater Our rock-bound island home We'll cast back many upon regret As for life's peace we roam Until on our last battle's fear The light of heaven shall flow Till never fail to drink to burn And many havens home Oh, many havens home Oh, many havens home We'll sing our grandminton's end Of many havens home May the army be augmented So more than we let flow May our country in the hour of need Be ready for the fall May the time that's those who let you Let me see the chosen road We're strobing love In thy heart's name For many havens home Oh, many havens home Oh, many havens home We'll sing our grandminton's end Of many havens home From West Point We conclude this quarter hour of song By the Cadet Glee Club Conducted by Cadet G.S. Harper With warrant officer Barry Drews in charge And Cadet W.S. Fisher, pianist On Tuesday, June 4th at 10 a.m. The address of Secretary of War Patterson To the graduating class Will be broadcast over station WNYC This is Major Bill Hood speaking And returning you to the studios Of the Municipal Broadcasting System May we introduce Pete McGinnis Now what do you think of anything Being 300 years old, Pete? Well, I want to let my good friends know That there's been 300 years of royal welcome that we have in the Borough of Brooklyn. And in this Borough, we gather many tongues of many nations all over the world. And we live all happy together, no matter what race we come to, no matter what our religion is. God has given us that feeling that we shall continue to love one another, irrespective of our religion, our politics, as long as we are all good fellows together. I say in this great Borough, in 300 years, it has developed, and it's been an inspiration for the whole world. Those who have never had the chance to see our great Borough, finally come here to see our tall buildings, our great manufacturers, our many things of the interest that help supply the good things all over the world. Oh, people, when the opportunity comes to you, kindly visit our Borough. We are the Borough of good-hearted people, good-natured people. No drive was ever started in the Borough of Brooklyn that ever fell down. This Borough has been generous in everything. War-Burn drives, Red Cross drives, War-Burn drives, Cancer drives, and many, many others, because the people of Brooklyn were always generous, and they give, they give them now to this hunger famine all over the world. And I hope the world in return won't take advantage of us, as has been done on many occasions, for love and a joy, the friendship, not alone of the Borough of Brooklyn, but the good people that come from all parts of the world to make our country what it is today. And Brooklyn is one of the springs in our country that has developed, and we in Brooklyn are very, very proud that we are residents of this Borough. I thank you. Now, Pete, you've committed a grave error. You haven't said a word about Greenpoint. Well, I wanted to be a little modest. I want to feel this way, that to me, Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world. It is a spot where I was raised and first seen the light of day, at number 132 Eagle Street. Thanks be to God there was a Greenpoint. Thanks be to God that the light of day gave me my opportunity. And to the people of Greenpoint, I worked and worked the same as every other man, and labored on the docks. I pulled lumber. I worked in the whole of business. I'm proud and proud that I was a long shaman. I'm delighted to say that I work with men, and I've done the same thing as every other man done. I work for an honest living, and thanks be to God for that. Thanks be to God. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? Oh, I'd surely, I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more, and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building housing of Borough President. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836, and then a depression set in. It lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years, and then the building was finally erected in 1848. That building was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land, which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there, on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down, and we're going to build 11 and a half million dollar, Kings County Supreme Court building. Then you go down a little further, and we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there, and we're going to renovate that and use it there. We're out of a car, another one of these. Thanks a lot. We're here at Brooklyn, at Borough Hall, as we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old, just two years more, and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building, housing a borough president. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836, and then a depression set in, and it lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected in 1848, that was when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land, which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down, and we're going to build $11.5 million, Kings County Supreme Court building. When you go down a little further, we're going to have a brand-new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there, and we're going to renovate that and use it for a federal court. This whole Brooklyn Civic Center is going to be flanked on both sides by public buildings, and right in the center of it, it's going to be a war memorial, and it's going to be a useful one instead of brick, lime, lumber, and cement. It's going to be in honor of the 327,000 boys and girls who fought in this war. And don't forget, Brooklyn supplied more, and that 327,000, the many of 39 states in the Union. In this war memorial, you're going to have an auditorium that holds 1,500 people. And then you're going to have a room on the right where the trophies that our boys captured from the four corners of the world are going to be on display. And then on the left-hand side is going to be a room in bronze where the names will be inscribed of every boy and girl who made the supreme sacrifice. And downstairs, this is very interesting, and I believe you'll like it. We're going to have a room for each of the veterans' organizations, which isn't anywhere in the city of New York. We're going to have the American Legion, the King's County, the Spanish War veterans, the Catholic War veterans, and the Jewish War veterans. They're all going to be down there in that one building. So if any of these 327,000 veterans need assistance, they'll have a central location point to which to go. Thank you. I appreciate you very much, Mr. President, your busy life, stepping by this way and taking a few moments. That was quite a celebration you had down with Hamilton Ferry, wasn't it? Do you want to say a word about that? Yes, that was a big thrill. I'll tell you a little about that. The third boat, known as the Moran Thugboat Company, supplied it as a company. He lives in Brooklyn, and he's a resident. I wonder if we can pick up somebody here, will you? I shouldn't say pick up, that's the wrong term.
