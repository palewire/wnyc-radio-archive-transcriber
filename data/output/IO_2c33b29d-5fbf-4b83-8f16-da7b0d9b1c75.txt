For their third and concluding number, the Glee Club presents Benny Havens, a ballad sung by Sons of West Point for over a hundred years, and sung today wherever West Pointers gather. Come fill your glasses below And stand up in our row To singing sentimentally We're going far to go In the army there's so dry at feet From motion very slow So we'll sing our grand Millicenters Of Benny Havens, O Benny Havens, O O Benny Havens, O O Benny Havens, O We'll sing our reminiscence Of Benny Havens, O To our kind old alma mater Our rock-bound island home We'll cast back many upon regret As for life's feet we roam Until on our last battleship The lights of heaven shall show May have for life all Ch leaned to none Will ever fail To drink through birth And Benny Havens Fun And Benny Havens Flo O Benehaven Hall, O Benehaven Hall, We'll sing our grand melancholy, O Benehaven Hall. May the army be augmented, So more than steel that flow, May our country in the hour of me, Be ready for the fall. May the time of soldiers let them face, Be a chosen soul, We're thrown in love, In thy heart's name, For Benehaven Hall. O Benehaven Hall, O Benehaven Hall, We'll sing our grand melancholy, And the land of Benehaven Hall. From West Point, we conclude this quarter hour of song by the Cadet Glee Club, Conducted by Cadet G. S. Harper, With Warrant Officer Barry Drews in charge, And Cadet W. S. Fisher, Pianist. On Tuesday, June 4th, at 10 a.m., The address of Secretary of War Patterson, To the graduating class, Will be broadcast over station WNYC. This is Major Bill Hood speaking, And returning you to the studios of the Municipal Broadcasting System. The name of the President, May we introduce Pete McGinnis. Now, what do you think of anything being 300 years old, Pete? Well, I want to let my good friends know, That there's been 300 years of royal welcome, That we have in the borough of Brooklyn. And in this borough, We have gathered many tongues of many nations all over the world. And we live all happy together, No matter what race we come to, No matter what our religion is, God has given us that feeling, That we shall continue to love one another, In respect of our religion, our politics, As long as we are all good fellows together. I say in this great borough, In 300 years, It has developed, And it's been a thing, Of an inspiration, For the whole world, Those that have never had the chance, To see our great borough, And our great manufacturing, Our many things, And that'll help supply the good things, All over the world. Oh people, When the opportunity comes to you, Kindly visit our borough. We are the borough of good-hearted people, Good natured people, When the opportunity comes to you, kindly visit our borough. We are the borough of good-hearted people, good-natured people. No drive was ever started in the borough of Brooklyn that ever fell down. This borough has been generous in everything. Warfront drives, Red Cross drives, Warfront drives, Cancer drives, and many, many others. Because the people of Brooklyn were always generous, and they give. They give them now to this hunger famine all over the world. And I hope the world in return won't take advantage of us, as has been done on many occasions, but love and enjoy the friendship, not alone of the borough of Brooklyn, but the good people that come from all parts of the world to make our country what it is today. And Brooklyn is one of the springs in our country that has developed, and we in Brooklyn are very, very proud that we are residents of this borough. I thank you. Now, Pete, you've committed a grave error. You haven't said a word about Greenpoint. Well, I wanted to be a little modest. I want to feel this way, that to me, Greenpoint is the garden spot of the world. It is the spot where I was raised and first seen the light of day at number 132 Eagle Street. Thanks be to God there was a Greenpoint. Thanks be to God that the light of day gave me my opportunity. And to the people of Greenpoint, I worked and worked the same as every other man, and labored on the docks. I pulled lumber. I worked in the whole of business. I'm proud of that I was a long shaman. I'm delighted to say that I worked with men, and I've done the same thing as every other man done. Worked for an honest living, and thanks be to God for that. Thanks be to God. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? Well, I'd surely, I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old. Just two years more, and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building, housing a borough president. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836, and then a depression set in. It lay here in Brooklyn as a white elephant for 10 years. And then the building was finally erected in 1848. That's when it was first occupied. We paid $52,000 for the land, which today is assessed for $3,600,000. Over there, on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down, and we're going to build $11.5 million Kings County Supreme Court building. Then you go down a little further, and we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there, and we're going to renovate that and use it there. We're out of a car. In other words, thanks a lot. We're here at Brooklyn, at Borough Hall. As we stand here and look down historic Fulton Street, we get some idea of the development of Brooklyn as we look, as we said before, at the span of bridges. I wonder if Mr. Cashmore would like to speak a word to you. Could we take a moment of your time, Mr. President? All right, surely. I'd be glad to on our 300th anniversary. We're standing on the steps of Borough Hall. It's 98 years old, just two years more, and we'll have an anniversary for the oldest public building housing a Borough President. It may interest you to know that this building was started in 1836, and then a depression set in.

Over there, on the right-hand side, that old Arbuckle building, that's coming down, and we're going to build $11.5 million, Kings County Supreme Court building. When you go down a little further, we're going to have a brand new post office site. The old post office building, we're still going to keep there, and we're going to renovate that and use it for a federal court. This whole Brooklyn Civic Center is going to be flanked on both sides by public buildings, and right in the center of it, it's going to be a war memorial, and it's going to be a useful one instead of brick, lime, lumber, and cement. It's going to be in honor of the 327,000 boys and girls who fought in this war. Don't forget, Brooklyn supplied more, and that 327,000, and of 39 states in the Union. In this war memorial, you're going to have an auditorium that holds 1,500 people, and then you're going to have a room on the right where the trophies that our boys captured from the four corners of the world are going to be on display. Then on the left-hand side is going to be a room in bronze where the names will be inscribed of every boy and girl who made the supreme sacrifice. And downstairs, this is very interesting, and I believe you'll like it. We're going to have a room for each of the veterans' organizations, which isn't anywhere in the city of New York. We're going to have the American Legion, the Kings County, the Spanish War veterans, the U.S. the Catholic War veterans, the Jewish War veterans. They're all going to be down there in that one building. So as any of these 327,000 veterans need assistance, they'll have a central location point to which to go. Thank you. I appreciate you very much, Mr. President, your busy life, stepping by this way and taking a few moments. That was quite a celebration you had down at Hamilton Ferry, wasn't it? Do you want to say a word about that? Yes, that was a big thrill. I'll tell you a little about that. A ferry boat known as the Moran Thugboat Company supplied it as a company. He lives in Brooklyn, and he's a resident. I wonder if we can pick up somebody here, will you? I shouldn't say pick up, that's the wrong term. He, he, he, he. He walked across the square with Pete McGinnis sometimes, very athletic young man shook hands with him, and he says, How are you, he says... He knows what issues have been working on him while taking time, took time looking at him before the light of the day. Here comes the sophisticated ic
