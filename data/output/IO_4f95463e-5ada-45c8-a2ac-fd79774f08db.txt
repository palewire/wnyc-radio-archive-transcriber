Yesterday the magnificent waters of New York Harbor, one of the most famous harbors in the world, and no doubt one of the reasons why we have one of the greatest commercial and industrial cities in the world, was the host or hostess shall I say to the new queen of the French fleet, the Ile de France, the reconditioned Ile de France. It cost 25 million dollars to recondition. It is now one of the finest boats flying between here and La Belle France, the old and traditional friend of the United States of America, and this bond of friendship will be attested here today in City Hall, when the Mayor of the City of New York and his reception committee headed by Mr. Whelan will conduct the distinguished guests of the French line here, to receive the congratulations of the City of New York in the reconditioning of this great liner, when the Honorable Vincent Impoletari, acting Mayor of the City of New York, will act for Mayor O'Dwyer, who is at present out of town. The Ile de France is very closely connected with the City of New York, because in previous years, it was on this fine liner, in direct communication from the ancient land of France to the equally ancient City of New York, some of the most distinguished guests received here at City Hall in previous administrations, had voyaged on the Ile de France. And it is quite a reunion of friendships to know that this great liner, having served its purpose in the war days, is now back in the transatlantic trade to carry the passengers back and forth between these two great nations, France and America. Commissioner Wallander has just come in, former Commissioner Wallander, we say Commissioner affectionately, has just come into the Council Chamber here in City Hall, and Mr. Whelan is just awaiting the word now to conduct his guests into the Council Chamber. A group of distinguished citizens have turned out to meet the members of the crew, headed by their valiant captain of the Ile de France, and the officers and ranking members of the French Line, the Campagne Generale Transatlantique, and they will receive full honors from the City today in the accomplishment of restoring this great liner to the Atlantic service. One of the beauties, and one of the most entrancing sights of New York City is the sight of these great liners, coming in and out of the great harbor, in order to carry on the industry and commerce between France and America. And now Mr. Whelan has just entered the Council Chamber with the Honorable Vincent Impeletteri, Mayor of the City of New York and the distinguished guests of the French Line. And in just a moment we'll hear the voice of Mr. Whelan as he presents his guests. It's generally a moment for formalities, while friends who haven't met us yet have the opportunity to greet each other and say hello. The French anthem, the Marseillais, will be sung by Marcel Daigne, who had such a good time in Paris, and she missed the Ile de France, but as a commentary on modern transportation facilities, why she took a plane and got here almost simultaneously, although very much behind the sailing time of the Ile de France. Mr. Whelan is now greeting Madame Denia and Peggy Turner of the French Line. Mr. Owen Anderson will be at the piano for the anthem. And then the Police Glee Club, that splendid musical organization of our own, of which we are so justly proud. We'll sing the Star Spangled Banner and other musical features of the reception to the members, crew, and officers, and line representatives of the distinguished French Line. A company that has done much to maintain the commerce and industry between ancient France and the Great Harbour of New York. Mr. Whelan. We'll now come to water, and we will start the program by the singing of the martial age by Madame Denia of the Paris Opera.

Marchons, marchons, Je sois dire, A bout de rafonnus, Mr. Whelan. Oh, say can you see, By the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed, At the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad bright land-right sky, Bright land-right stars, Through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched, Were so gallantly streaming, In the early future, To some bursting in air, In the early night, From theいい day, To see the stars, song詞ert ache Mind Of wolves, by the darkness, of others, By the dawn's earlyidor, I'm the home of the brave. Acting Mayor Impel Terry, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I have the great privilege this morning, Mr. Mayor, to present to you three distinguished gentlemen that arrived yesterday on board the Ile de France. The Minister of Merchant Marine, André Collin, the President of the French Line, Mr. Jean-Marie, and the Commodore, the Captain of the Ile de France, Joseph Kéas, and also the distinguished French Ambassador to the United States, who is present with us, as is the French Consul General at New York. They came, sir, as you know, with the symbol of the great democratic, friendly nation of France. They brought with them, with that symbol, a war record that all of us are proud to recall, having the Ile de France having carried more than 400,000 troops during the war. And now she comes here to again become a part of our peaceful trade between the old and the new world. I'm sure, sir, that no one is more happy than you and the officials of the City of New York and our great citizenship in the reconstructed Ile de France. And may she long have a successful and happy and peaceful career. I have the great pleasure, sir, of presenting these distinguished gentlemen to you at this time. Mr. Whelan, Ambassador Bonet, the Council General Chancel, Mr. Colon, Marie, and Captain Calios, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I am earnestly proud, as Acting Mayor of the City of New York, to participate in these ceremonies today, marking another heartwarming expression of the sincere goodwill which exists between the people of the City of New York and the people of France. I bring you the very cordial greetings of Mayor O'Dwyer and the people of our city. And I join them in extending to you our very best welcome as well as our congratulations to all those who helped to make this occasion possible. May I compliment you, Commandant Calios, and the members of your crew for the safe arrival of the Ile de France on this, her initial voyage upon re-entering peacetime passenger service after what has been heralded as a most impressive wartime record. This newly rebuilt flagship of the great French line is a magnificent symbol of the friendship that has kept America and France united for generations both in war and in peace. New Yorkers got a great thrill yesterday watching this superliner plowing up the bay in her first post-war passenger voyage. They would have had an even greater thrill, Grover Whelan tells me, if they went aboard as he did and got a first-hand view of the wonderful installations, facilities, and accommodations on board that liner. It is no exaggeration when the French line boasts that this historic liner has been transferred and transformed into a ship that surpasses even her former self in passenger comforts and technical improvements. And that, believe me, is saying something. For when the elder France first slid down the ways at Saint-Nazaire in 1926, she was heralded, even at that time, as a new luxurious era of ocean travel. I want to take this opportunity of congratulating Mr. Jean-Marie, chairman of the board of the French line, for the amazing job that has been done with the Ile de France and for the faith that his company has placed in the redevelopment of peacetime ocean travel with this tremendous investment, particularly in this investment that symbolizes the traditional friendship of France and America. At the same time, I want to acknowledge the efforts of Mr. Andrew Cullen, minister of the French Merchant Marine, in bringing about this great post-war event. This welcome today of the captain, the crew, and the many distinguished passengers of the Ile de France has for us a very tremendous significance in the present and future relations of our two countries. Here is a dramatic stimulant to the peacetime pursuits of travel and the exchange of ideas and cultures. Here is impressive evidence of the faith we share that the troubles of our post-war world are not at all insurmountable and that we are beginning to emerge from the disruptions of war into a new era of progress and peace. I feel certain that the Ile de France will truly stimulate the love of America and the love of democracy that exists in the hearts of the French people. We have a very great concern for the welfare of our French neighbors, a concern that has been clearly demonstrated with the events of recent months, the Marshall Plan and the friendship food shipments. it is clear that the United States is eager to assist the French people in rehabilitating their economy and it is deeply gratifying today for me representing the people of the city of New York to give public tribute to the strides that have already been made by the French people led by their gallerous leaders in bringing about that accomplishment. So may I, in conclusion, welcome you to our shores and I know that the people of the city of New York join me in that sincere welcome. And now, Mr. Whelan.
