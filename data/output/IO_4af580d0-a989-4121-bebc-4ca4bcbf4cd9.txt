The President of the United States who labored long and hard to get out the vote. And most of all, tribute for this victory must be paid to all the American people, working men, farmers, professional men, and civil servants, businessmen, and the millions of housewives who helped swell the Democratic vote. They showed that they are politically alert and completely able to judge candidates and political parties on their record of performance. The American people have shown what they want. They have given the Democratic Party a challenge. The Democratic Party will live up to its great trust. We have the official victory statement by Democratic Senator Jay Howard McClain claiming the election for President Obama. We're going to take the microphone to the platform and see if we can speak to him. We're up now. He's standing amid the flashbulbs which are going off here. His family wants to pass. Is this Mrs. McGrath? That's right. Mrs. McGrath, how are you? Oh, fine, thank you. How do you feel today? Very happy. Your husband, of course, is the man who led as the national chairman of the Democratic Party to this victory. May I speak to the kids? Could you get them over a second? Yeah. That was Mrs. McGrath. She's being pushed and jostled here so by the photographers that she can hardly speak. Here is young David McGrath. I'd like to get you to talk. Can you say hello? Hello. Hello. The photographers are pressing in just as quickly as they can, and we had to get back for a second while they could take their pictures. Mrs. McGrath spoke to us a moment, and perhaps you'll talk again. No, we have to wait till these photographers. They are standing on the platform now. Directly behind them are the pictures of President Truman and Vice President Alvin W. Barkley, for whom Mr. McGrath has just claimed victory and made the official victory statement, which we've been waiting for in this remarkable election so far. He's shouting back and forth to the photographers, has a great wide grin on his face. Next to young David McGrath, his son, is Mrs. India Edwards, who is Executive Director of the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee. I think she'd certainly like to have some. She reaches over and gives Mr. McGrath a great big kiss. They kiss directly on the platform here. We're going to try to get to the Senator in just a moment, but of course there's quite a rush here with television, newsreels, and everything else. We have to take our time before we can get them to speak to us individually. Senator, could you come over just a second, please? Let me step out of the way. Here is the Democratic National Chairman, Senator J. Howard McGrath. Could you talk to us a second? Oh, just to say thanks a million to the great many mutual listeners who have stayed up all night and all day for this great moment. Well, thank you and thanks for mutual, Senator. And now here is Mrs. India Edwards, Executive Director of the Women's Division of the Democratic Committee. What do you have to say? I think it's the most glorious victory the women have ever won. I know they came out and elected Harry Truman President this time. And we wanted to talk to young David McGrath a moment ago, but he was so pushed out that he didn't have a chance to. What about you? Well, I think that it's very nice to be up here and I didn't want to miss any of this and I hope Harry S. Truman will win. He did win, Lord. Well, Mrs. Edwards looks over and says he did win after that victory statement. She's not forgetting her politics. They go back now. Mr. McGrath. We take an offer. To keep our nation strong and free and to establish peace in the world. Thomas E. Dewey. What time was I sent you? Just sent a few minutes ago. That's all. That was James Haggerty, Governor Dewey's press secretary, reading the telegram, which of course means that Governor Dewey has conceded the election to President Harry S. Truman. That probably winds up affairs here at Republican headquarters in New York. It's been a long vigil throughout the night. We've been here now for some 18 hours. And finally, the climax has come. Governor Dewey has conceded the election to President Harry S. Truman. Mr. Haggerty is now rereading the telegram for the press. Photographers are really having a heyday here, taking pictures of this very dramatic moment in this 1948 election. This is Hollis Seavey speaking from Republican headquarters in New York City. We now return you to mutual election headquarters in New York. We now return. Allay, listen. I return up to the election siege because what we looked for decided values were absolutely registered. I return up to him right now. We have a heatował day with the debates by President Harry S., and he must have to share his imagination. To create status quo, when he akkor see %uh congress will be looking for justice. At the moment he sees those true each other that he moves to theirиться. In particular, he becomes president John Mann. Well, the pictures are all done now, and I think Truman will retire for a few minutes, perhaps to work on the formal statement that he will issue later. I return you now to Milchel's election headquarters in New York. Thank you, Charter Heslop in Kansas City. Ladies and gentlemen, Harry S. Truman, by the vote of the American people, has been elected to succeed himself as President of the United States. Now, here is Gabriel Heater. Hurry, hurry, hurry. It's time for the Vaudeville Theatre. Give me a short vamp there, please, Mr. Conductor. Yes, it's Thursday night, and time for WNYC's recorded presentation of the Vaudeville Theatre. So sit back and get ready to be taken once again to those days of the three-a-day in the Keith Circuit. Yes, sit back and listen to the Vaudeville Theatre. The Vaudeville Theatre.

The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End anybody here that they don't already know? What happened? What happened, Governor? I am just as surprised as you are, Dick, and I gather that that is shared by everybody in the room. As I read your stories before the election. And looking back over at Governor, was it an error of strategy or of tactics or what? No, I I'm, Governor Warren and I are both very happy. I've talked with him that we waged a clean and constructive campaign and I have no regrets whatsoever. Was there anything about failing to get out the grassroots vote? I don't know. I haven't had a chance to study the detailed figures. Governor, what role do you think Labor plays? The question is, it's impossible to know that you know more about figures. And the Governor has said it's impossible. But, uh, I seem to think Labor didn't play a major role. It's very hard to tell. Particularly when you find states like Wisconsin and Iowa going contrary to the opinions of all observers. Along that same line, Governor, what do you think were the chief operating faculty? I think that would be impossible to answer at this stage. I'd have to study it a little more and hear a lot more opinion. Read what you, uh, ladies and gentlemen, write over the next few days. All right. You think you need a little guidance on the subject? Governor, sir, what are you... not a better able to guide you than, uh, before election? Governor, what are your own plans? I'm going to Albany at, uh, five o'clock this afternoon with, uh, uh, Mrs. Dewey and my mother and the two boys. And then I imagine I'll go down to the farm pretty soon. For the weekend, at least. You don't intend any long vacation to get over the rigors of campaign? I haven't any plans for that. Governor, how about political plans? How about political plans? I have no plans for anything at this moment. Governor, the AP has a story on the wires that you were planning to resign to cut short. That's the word argument. Pure fiction. I don't think the answer was pure fiction. Gentlemen from the AP would like to have the, uh, AP part of your question taken out since he says he doesn't think it was the AP. That's a private fight you have to settle the agreement. Do you think resentment against the 80 of Congress may have had something to do with your treatment? Well, I think, I think that also is one of the things we'd have to conclude by after careful examination. the Congress in the election. What do you think is the future of the Republican Parliament? Well, as I understand it, the difference of half of one percent in three or four states would have made a different result. So, uh, that leaves the question pretty wide open, I think. Governor, what do you think of the future of the Progressive Party? What do you think of the future of the Progressive Party? Not much. They said not much and got a big laugh. What do you think of the future of the political polls? Well, I don't like to comment on anybody else's misfortune. I guess all the newspapers in the country that had polls have red faces, too, this morning, don't they? I heard his reply read on the radio, but if it had come in before I left, it hadn't reached me. But I hear from the radio what he said. Governor Dewey, do you think that the American people maybe are not ready for an intellectual appeal, that they still like coin? Ruth, I'll have to leave that to your own conclusion.
