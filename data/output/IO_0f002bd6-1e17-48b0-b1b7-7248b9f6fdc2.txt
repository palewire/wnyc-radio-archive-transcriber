On the banks of Allen Water, where the known old spread is so, There is no one of the miller's daughters, but it's blinded no more. For the sun are free, that's all right, and the soldier falls not near, On the banks of Allen Water, where the wind and snow fell by, On the banks of Allen Water, where the wind and snow fell by, There was a sea of miller's daughters, till he moved the land.

And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Bore, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. . Let it go be, I got no car, got no mule, I got no misery. The closest let me up and down, got a lock on the door. Bring somebody to go and run, but without a make in war. What for, what for? I got a lock on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay to speak. For the things that are tied, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I got plenty of love here, and nothing's ready for me. I got my gal, got my song, my head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? Not my gal, got my gal, got my lord, got my dog. I got my gal, got my gal, got my gal, got my gal. I have plenty of love, and love is plenty for me. I can't the sun, can't the moon, can't the people see. The folks with plenty of money, God will pray all the day. Heaps the plenty, you're not the worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away, I am a friend of hell, in a time of life. Never will be long as I'm well, never will strive to be good, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm alive? Oh, I have plenty of love here, and love is plenty for me. I got my gals, got my gals, for heaven all day long. Now you complain it. Drop my gals, drop my gals, drop my lords, drop my lords. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've Got Plenty of Nothing from Gershwin's Forgy and Bet.
