WNYC. City Zone Station WNYC. Own town. Your town. And everybody's town. Today we bring you the first episode in the story of the little town of Juniper Junction, which is located on the banks of a big river. It's your town. Everybody's town. There's a crossroads of experience, meet, and blend in the pattern of life. In this little town, you'll meet people you've known all your life. Folks who really live and know the value of what a real friend needs. In every little town, no matter how small, you'll find one important institution, the General Store. Here tears and laughter, sunshine and sorrow are all centered, where the life of the entire community flows through the front door of this one-story gray wooden building with its wide force. The store serves as a gathering place for any friend or neighbor that's walking down Main Street. The Sunset News, the weekly paper, which came out last Saturday, has an item in it I know you'll be interested in. I quote, Due to the death of Josh Goodman, his son David will not return to technical school to complete his last year in engineering, but will remain here and take over his father's business, the General Store. The grand reopening will take place next week. Elaborate plans for the big event will be found elsewhere. Good luck, David. That's the news item. The interest of everybody. And I know you'll be interested too. There's the store right over there. And that girl just walking up onto the porch with her arms full of mops and brooms and brushes and pails. She's mighty pretty, isn't she? For that's Sally Stevens. And she's in love with David Goodman. And the whole town loves them, for it's a small town where people really know one another. Is the whole store deserted? I know. There's David inside. See him? Through the window. David. David. David. David. David Goodman, come open this door. Is that this Sally? Yes, it's me Sally. My hands are full and I can't reach the handle. Hold everything. I'm coming. That is, if I can find my way. The floor is covered with junk. Then you'd better hurry off. Oh, David. Did you drop something? I dropped everything. Here, help me pick them up. Oh, David. Did you drop something? I dropped everything. Here, help me pick them up. Sure. How in the world did a little thing like you manage to carry all this stuff from your house? Well, I started out with just a mop and that booze. But when I got down as far as Reed, Mrs. Reed threw money out with a tail and butt. Because she said if I was coming down here to help you clean, I'd better take them. So I took them. I guess I've got everything. Come on in. You forgot the soap. Mrs. Ears gave me this. It's homemade. Mrs. Howe gave me the butt and Mrs. Reed gave me this mop. Wow, that sounds like a triumphal procession. It was, David. Everybody told me to tell you they win too much. And they all promised to give you great big orders to get you open. Gosh, they're swell friends all right. You know, when Dad died and I knew I couldn't go back to Peck, boy, I thought the end of the world had come. And now I want to make a cassette of this store and carry on in his place. He'd be very proud of you if he knew you'd given up cash to take over his store. I know. That's what makes it easier. My goodness, what a mess this place is in. I guess Dad wasn't very neat. I don't think a man is evident unless there's a woman around for two years. His mother died a year after I was born. It seems odd, Sal, not to have known your own mother. It must be, David. Mother's funny and seven-a-way, but I don't know what I'd do without her. He's swell. You know, in all the twenty years Dad had this store, I don't think he ever lost a customer. I just got to make good. Well, we can't waste any more time just looking. We've got to do something about it. Okay, Miss Field. Will you allow me to help you on with your smock? It will be a pleasure, sir. Hold it up for me. Very well, madam. Hey, what are you doing? Putting on my smock. What do you think? It seems to me you're trying to put your arms around me. I am not. It seems to me it looks that way to me. Billy, that's the way it goes on. Oh, instead of backing into it, you run into it. Hmm, how convenient. Oh, David. Everyone going by can look at me see it. Oh, what's the matter with that? I'd like to know. Yes, but David's sitting right in front of the window. Everyone knows we're going to get married as soon as I can make enough money from the store to pay off my school debt. Oh, David. There. Now, will you button me up the back? Well, if you insist. Come on. There. One button, two buttons. Thank you. Now let's go and, uh... Oh, wait a second. There you are. And now to what? There's lots to do. And not too much time to do it, any. What do you mean? I'm opening this Monday. Monday? Yes. And, Sal, that opening's really going to be something. I'm going to invite everybody in town. Are you hiding the town band? Yes, and speeches too. And souvenirs. Just like the Fourth of July celebrations. Mr. Barker's going to make the opening speech. Oh, yes, Mr. Barker. President of the Juniper Junction Trust Company, and chairman of the Board of Commerce, and so forth, and so forth. Oh, Sal, you'd better make the speech yourself. Oh, David, I can hardly wait. Well, come on, we've got to get to this. All right, then. What do we need? A ladder, for one thing. Then we can clean the top shelves, and chuck over the old stock first. Now, there's a ladder in the back room. I'll get it. Oh, dear, these men. Where did you put the dustpan and brush? The dustpan on the floor. Oh, yes, I've got it. Oh, just look at the dust on those shelves. I don't think the place is ever been seen. Well, that's good. Here's the ladder, Mr. Barker. Now, that's all right. Shall I get up, or will you? I will? Well, it isn't very steady, is it? Here, give me your hand and lock me up. That's all my hand, Billy. Sorry. I think it's silly to let go. You want me to move the tans with my teeth? Come on, David, we haven't got time. Oh, the ladder's scenery. Oh, David's steady. I've got it. Oh, that's unbelievable. You come down for me. I thought I was going on the floor when I wanted to see you. Come down. Where did you get this biggity thing? Probably out of the arch, from the way it works. I think so. You're clicking it, the arch. Now, Sal, come down and let me come up. The arch might topple over any minute. What do you think is I like it up here? Have you, Rag? No, Sal. If you think I'm going to stand here and hold this thing all day... I don't know, are you? There's only one thing to do. David, what are you doing? Coming up the other side, my lady. What for? Oh, David, I think you're going over there. Oh, I don't know. Are you? There's only one thing to do. David, what are you doing? Coming up the other side, my lady. What for? Oh, David, I think you're going over. Hold on. I mean, don't hold on. Oh, yeah. Oh, there we see, Mary again. Another person's tree. Now, David, let's get down. Oh, this is fine. You're only making matters late. Oh, steady, steady there. Now, nothing to do with this. All right. Oh. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. It still looks like a tree. Oh, hello, Romeo. Come on in. Hello, Jack. Uh, Mr. Goodman. How are you? I, uh, can I bother you for a minute? Sure. Come on in, Romeo. Come step in this ladder, how we get down, will you? Certainly. Certainly, Mr. Goodman. How are you, Romeo? Uh, I'm fine, sir. Uh, Mr. Steel. There. There. Thanks. Oh, you'll have to excuse all this mess. That'll have a cleaning house. Oh. Hi. I see. Ma said you'd be busy. Romeo, sir, what are you all dressed up for? Suddenly, two and all. Are you going someplace? No. No place special. Well, Romeo. How's school? I'm not attending school right now. You're going to school? Well. Well, Ma says the law says I don't have to go to school the day after I'm 14. And I was 14 two days ago. So I quit. Well, but what are you going to do now if you're not, uh, attending school? Well, I was thinking of going into business as soon as I can find a right open. Oh, I see. Well, when a man gets to be a certain age, he just naturally looks around to see where he can branch out. Well, I mean, when a man's 14. Yes, Romeo, I see what you mean. Well, 14 does have its responsibilities. That's what I mean. Responsibilities. Yes, Romeo. Yes. And I've been thinking that a man like me might be a big help in an organization like, like, well, for instance, a place where he might have to be spent on important errands. Or someplace like, uh, the past day. Well, no. No, no, Mr. Goodman. Not, not a bank. A store, maybe. Yeah, that's it. A store. Well, I see. Well, Romeo, if this happens that I need a man along the lines you mentioned around here. Of course, you may not consider this the right opening. Oh, gee, why, why, sure, I consider it a very fine opening. Then that's settled. Well, just how soon would you be requiring my services? Uh, suppose you'll be on hand tomorrow morning at, uh, 8 o'clock. Oh, sure. Sure, thanks. I gotta go home and tell Ma. Oh, uh, um, Mr. Goodman. Ma said if I was hired, I was to tell you that I appreciated deeply your efforts on my behalf. So, bye, Miss, did you? Bye, Romeo. Oh, David, you gave him a job. You, so... Well, I had to have a delivery for it, Sal, and Romo was a good lad. And goodness knows his mother needs the money bad enough supporting those kids by taking them watching. Oh, you wanted me to hire him. Now who's a thought? You still are. Excuse me. There's a bomb outside. What? A bomb. A bomb in a box. Oh, Romeo, you've been reading too many mystery stories. Oh, ma'am, it's the truth. There's a box on the porch and I can hear it kicking inside. A box that's dead? A box that's dead? Yes. Well, that sounds interesting. Let's investigate. I can say so. It isn't a very big bomb. I wonder what it is. Well, is it a bomb? I know it is. Listen. Somebody's playing a joke on us. I will say so. Go on left and see what it is. Gosh, you can't do that. I've read all about bombs in a modern adventure story. It might go off any minute. He's only over it couldn't possibly be a bomb. Come and get me a knife, so I cut this string. But it says in the book that a bomb should be kept in a bucket of water immediately on discovery. No, it says in the bomb, Romeo. Come and get the knife. Yes, sir. David. Yes? I suppose it might just happen to be a bomb. Sally, who sent me a bomb? Well, I don't think it is, but that's the move. Here you are. Gosh, if you're gonna open it, you better hurry. It's been two minutes since we found it. It's likely to go off any minute. Oh, dear, David, I wouldn't open it. You don't know what it is. I mean, Mr. Goodwin. What we need is, take action. Oh, David, what do we do? What do we do? What do we do, Romeo? Oh, can't be it, lady. Is that taking getting involved? I think it is. David, don't open it. You're all wondering. What, David? What? Romeo, don't get some water in the bucket. I've left! Oh, do you think it's a bomb, David? I don't know what it is. Maybe we're taking a stand. I'm coming. Hurry, Romeo, hurry! I'm coming. Oh, there's a little fish. She needs... Oh, do you need to put yourself? No, ma'am. Let me get it. No, David, carry the box out of the pump. I'll get some more. I don't need to get out of the stuff. I don't need to get out of the stuff. I don't need to get out of the stuff. I don't need to get out of the stuff. Mike, don't you know? No, darling. I haven't spent my time reading about the pump. Well, you shouldn't have meant to know about things. Tell me, Romeo, Romeo. Tell me, Romeo. Here, here we are. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What do you think about it? David, quick. Put the box in the water. It's running your... It's running your... It's running your... It's running your... Nothing's going to happen. I knew it wasn't a bomb. It didn't... Hey, it's... Maybe it's still going off. You don't want to... You better... Let's read something. How could there possibly be a bomb in Jennifer's dump? I guess you're right. Suppose the movie is on the vacation. The man told all I told you to. Hard time to finish. Let's see what Billy is in the box. It's still a picnic. Oh, it's so wonderful. Oh, it's so wonderful. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. I had a lot of excitement today. Who sent that box? And what really is in it? Listen in on Wednesday to Home House and find out more about our new family. And what's in that box? This is the Municipal Broadcast. Home Town. Your Town and Everybody's Town. Yes, folks, it's Home Town. Now, in every home town, you'll find one important institution, and that's the General Store. Here, the life of an entire community flows through the front door of this one-story gray wooden building with its wide ports. Also, the General Store serves as a gathering place for any friend and neighbor who's walking down Main Street. And who's this coming down Main Street now? I do believe it's David Goodman. Yes, it is. You know, he's the new proprietor of the General Store. Everyone in Juniper Junction was mighty pleased when he decided to take over the store after his father's death, rather than finish his work at technical school. And look at those packages he has. They're probably new stock he's putting in the store for the grand opening next week. And who's that with them? Yes, it's Sally Steele, David Sweetheart. They're laughing about something, maybe about that box they found yesterday. They thought at first it was a bomb. Let's find out what was really in that box. Ha ha ha! Every time I think of Romeo opening the door saying, there's a bomb outside, a bomb in a box, it nearly kills me. Kills me to think that we took it all in. Oh, but David, thank the excitement we had. Yeah, and especially when we thought the bomb was going off. And all the time it was an alarm clock from Uncle John. Well, you know, that's what I like about this town of Juniper Junction. What, David? Well, Uncle John sends me a present wishing me good luck. And it's such a big event here that we think it's probably a bomb. Nowhere else could you have so much fun over one package arriving. Nowhere, David. Oh, David, let's do hurry. This package is getting heavier by the fifth second. Well, you shouldn't be carrying that heavy load. I could have left it down there to... Stop back at the post office for it, I know. But I couldn't wait that long to see what's inside. Oh dear, let's run. Oh, now how can I run with two bridge lamps in one hand and a lawnmower in the other? Besides, I have some news to tell you. Oh, just ten more steps and we're there. Yes, I think the general store sign looks much more impressive now that it's painted in black and gold. Sally! Well, don't you think it does? Don't I think what does? Listen, will you put down that package and tell me the news? The news? Oh, that will have to wait. Now hurry. Oh, what a relief. Yes, the sign does look much better that way. What's in all these packages, David? Come on, now you tell me what you know and then and only then will I tell you what's in the packages. Oh, didn't I tell you? Well, Mrs. Stubbs was in the post office yesterday. Yes? And she apparently saw Miss Triphosa picking beer and they talked about things. Oh, yes, yes, sure, of course. Well, Miss Triphosa came over to the house last night and guess what she told Mother? What? Uncle John was in the post office yesterday and told Triphosa that if she thought he was coming down to pass his time at the general store with a young man full of new notions running the place, she was crazy. You mean then Uncle John isn't coming? I guess not. But listen to the rest, David. Triphosa got mad and said nobody in Juniper Junction could say she was crazy. And then Uncle John called her an old maid and Triphosa began to cry and life was very hectic down at the post office. Oh, poor Uncle John. He does have a terrible time with Triphosa, always taking everything he says seriously. But gosh, I'm sorry he isn't coming down. He was always around when Dad ran the store. Let's take these things inside and see what we have. Wait. Listen. Did you hear something fall inside the store? Yes. Oh, David, you don't think someone is trying to take things, do you? Oh, no. Of course not. Hello? Hello? Anybody there? Oh, it was probably our imagination. Yeah, I guess so. Gosh knows everything's in just the same mess as we left it yesterday. Well, unwrap the lamp, David. Mother needs one for the living room and you might have a customer right off the bat. Oh, it is a nice one. And I love this adjustable arm. Hey, what was that? There is someone in here, David. I know it. Well, look for him, David. Don't just stand there. Oh, now, Sal. Keep calm. Keep calm. I'm perfectly calm. Oh, he's in the storeroom, I think. Oh, David, don't go without me. There isn't even a place in here where a man could hide. But I know there's something. Look, Sal. Oh, David, where? On that packing case. Oh, it's Romeo. And he's asleep. And I was expecting to find Bluebeard, or a bandit at least. Gee, I shouldn't think that sack of potatoes would make a very comfortable pillow. So Romeo whines and he's asleep. I wonder what he's dreaming about. I wonder how long he's been here. Romeo. Hey, Romeo. Oh, hello. Come on, it's time to go to work. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Sure, I just sat down for a minute and I guess I... Just took a cat nap, huh? I guess so. Good morning, Romeo. What time did you get here? Good morning, Miss Steele. Oh, I don't know, you see. I wanted to be here on time to prepare for the opening and all, so... Well, I got up at five o'clock. Why, Romeo! Oh, that's nothing. Nothing at all. It's business, you see. Oh, I see. I put the door key back on the windowsill just like you said, Mr. Goodman. Fine. And I got a few things here in my bundle that I thought you might need. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. Gosh, it was the bundle we heard drop on the floor. Oh, that's all right. I don't deal in breakable things. That is, not exactly... I noticed that you didn't have a pencil sharpener, so I brought you this one. It's all right if you kind of hold the handle on. Oh, thanks, Romeo. You see, I wanted you to know right away you could depend on me. Yeah, that's fine. Well, come on now, let's get busy. Oh, Mr. Goodman. Mr. Goodman, wait a second. I mean, if you're sleeping. Sure, Romeo, what do you want? I also made out a list of things that you might want me to do. Good heavens, Romeo, you have been busy since you got up. Oh, gosh, I aim to give satisfaction. The first thing on the list is time of arrival. Well, I usually get down here about 8 o'clock. Then you don't think that I'd better plan to get up at 5 every morning? Oh, gosh, no, I don't think it'll be necessary. Of course, I would like it if... Oh, all right, not at all. I'll do just whatever you do. Come on, let's see what's in this imposing box. I think it's dressed good. Now, listen, Romeo, you put your things in the back room, and you'll find an apron hanging on the back of the door. I think it'll fit. An apron? Gee. Oh, boy. David, isn't he wonderful? Romeo, let's see how you look when you get it on. Okay. Oh, it'll look fine. Look, look, Tally, it's got General Store on the front. Oh, that's fine. And I got me a cap, too. How'd I look? Most business like Romeo. What does another stand for? S-M-J-J-G-S. Oh, those. Well, that's an idea I had. It means Special Messenger for the Juniper Junction General Store. Did you do that all by yourself? Yeah. I had some green paint over at the house, and I kind of got the idea this morning. How about taking this trash out and back, Romeo? Sure, sure, Mr. Goodman. Oh, uh, Mr. Goodman. Yes? Oh, uh, I got some more things on my list. If we could attend to that, then I could get on with my work. Okay, sure. Yeah, well, the next thing was Deliver Order. Yeah? You'll find me very reliable. I can always remember everything, so if you'll just tell me where they go, I'll see that they get there. Gosh, I couldn't ask for anything. You know what I'm doing? I'm going to have to wait for you. I'd be in the room. I'm going to have to wait for you. Well, I'm going to have to wait for you. I'm going to have to wait for you. I'm going to have to wait for you. Well, I'm going to have to wait for you. Well, I'm going to wait for you. I can always remember everything, so if you'll just tell me where they go, I'll see that they get there. Gosh, I couldn't ask for anything more. Well, what's next? Get the mail. When the mail gets in. Yeah. And last, do whatever I can at any time what David wants me to do. Well, that's splendid, Romeo. Listen, now, if I can suggest a few additions, we can call it a day. Sure, sure, Mr. Goodman. Anything at all. I've got my pencil right here. I'm all ready to take them down. Okay, now, first, sweep the floor in the morning. Then, keep the counters and the shelves fully stocked, and then... Just a second there, Mr. Goodman. I'm afraid I'll have to borrow that pencil sharpener. My pencil's a little blunt. Okay, here you are. I thought I might post the list on the wall for occasional references. Yeah, that's a swell idea. All right, and then wrap the bundles, and then take care of the horse, and then... I'm not quite ready yet. The sharpener don't seem to be very satisfactory. Here, let me try. Well, if you could just hold on to the handle there. Here? Yeah. You see, it's a fine sharpener, only some... Oh, gee. Gosh, it doesn't seem to work, does it? No, I guess not. Well, suppose I finish the list while you take out the trash. Yeah, sure, sure thing. I can't understand about that pencil. I wouldn't even believe, ever believe that was Romeo if I hadn't seen it myself. Because maybe I'd better turn over the store to him and retire. Had you seen him getting up at five o'clock and fixing his cap and making out that list? Maybe you suppose he'll remember everything? Well, he has the list, but he doesn't. I guess he's not the only one who needs a list to remember by. Yes, I know. People are still forget... What do you mean? Haven't you forgotten something? Why, no, David. Didn't I bring everything down yesterday and I told Mother to spend the luncheon? Oh. Well, maybe I have. Come on over here, just a minute. Well, all right. There. That's much better. Listen, little Minnie Mouse. Yes, Mickey? I've got lots of work to do in the store and you have your school teaching and we both have lots of things in our minds, but... Well, I don't want you to ever forget that the most important thing in the world is just you and me. Yes, I know, Mickey. And you won't ever forget. That's right, darling. Oh, David, I wanted you to know... Oh. Oh, well, I... I guess my place is in the barn. Oh, no, come on in, Romeo. Excuse me, but I was out in the barn seeing Mercury and brushing up the wagon and I thought... Well... What is it, Romeo? Well, there's some green paint out there and I thought that if the wagon had General Store Juniper Junction printed on the side, it might look more business-like. Oh, a wonderful idea, Romeo. You certainly like to print, don't you? Well, Uncle John says that advertising is the way to succeed in a little printing here and there don't hurt nothing. Well, Uncle John is right. The wagons will have a coat of print. Okay. Sure. Now, listen, Romeo, I think you better use the green paint like on the sign out in front. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'll attend to it right away. We'll hitch up Merck out in front, but they are the opening. Listen, there won't be any opening if we don't get to work. Hey, Sal, look. Where? Look, across the street. Is that Uncle John's car? Well, it looks like Uncle John, except for that rocking chair he's carrying upside down on his head. And look, baby. He's got his cat under John. What can he be doing? Gosh, it looks like he's moving out. Let's go find out. You, Uncle John! Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going? I'm coming just as fast as my legs will carry me. Well, where are you going with that chair? I tell you I'm coming. And if you'd like to know my intentions regarding the chair, that's going inside the general store. You're going to sell your freezer chair when you're... Uh, David, carry that chair right on up the stairs and in the door. No candles on here. Sure. Uh, Sally, you attend the Tarzan. She's getting kind of uppity this morning. Oh, nice, sir. It's her, Dad. But are you up to Uncle John? What am I up to? Uh-huh. You mean to tell me you've known me all your life and you want to know what I'm up to? Uh-huh. Well, young lady, I'm moving in. Really? Oh, how wonderful. What's that, Uncle John? I said I'm moving in. I told your dad... Uh, come on. Let's go in there, Sally, and so I can state my case clear to David, too. All right. You'll be so glad. I was saying, I told your dad I'd act as your advisor when he was gone. So, here I be to keep my promise. Even if you do have newfangled ideas. Oh, swell. Now, I know the store's going to open. Dad always said he couldn't run the store without you here to chin with him. Yep, we did a bit of chinning. But I gave him some very fine advice, David. I bet you did. Well, where do you have your chair, Uncle John? Or maybe I'd better say, where's the best place to keep an eye on David? That's easy, Sally girl. Just where it always was. Halfway between the pickle barrel and the cracker barrel, and within spitting distance of the stove. So, it seems that Uncle John has moved in after all. Is he really going to stay, though? Or will David's new ideas make him move again? Will Rumi always be the busy delivery boy, or is there something, perhaps, that sidetracks him from his work? Well, we'll know more about these things at 8.30 on Friday morning, so be sure to listen, then, to Home Town. Okay? Good job! Hi, grapher! Nice! Nice! Yes! Oh 100 This is Municipal Broadcasting System.
