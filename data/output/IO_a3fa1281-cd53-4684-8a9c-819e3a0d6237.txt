heaven Johnny, get the gun! Johnny, get the gun! Johnny, get the gun! Good, my darling, I must leave you, oh, it brings my heart to soul. Don't think that the I am needed, but the front to fight the war. Lay the white in your heart, and I can't no longer play. And I hear the beautiful party, oh, my darling, I can't no longer play. After the fall is over, after the praise of God, after the dancers are leaving, under the stars are gone, still your heart is waiting, if you'd greet her, oh, my darling, I can't no longer play. Come to me, sweet Marie, not because your face is fair, love to see, but your soul, so pure and sweet, makes my happiness complete, makes me fodder at your feet, sweet Marie. Where did you get that hat, where did you get that style? Isn't it a knobby one and just a proper style? I'd just like to have one, just the same as that. Where'er I go, they shout, hello! Where did you get that hat? Say au revoir, but not goodbye. The past is dead. Love cannot die. Love cannot die. Love cannot die. We're better fall had we not met. I love you then. I love you then. Love cannot die. Love cannot die. Love cannot die. Love cannot die. Love cannot die. Maybe, maybe, give me your answer too. I love crazy, oh, for the love of you. It won't be a smiling marriage, I can't afford a curry. But you're such ease for us, A life is one of them for two. When you hear the rest of things with me, For joy, love and crazy you must sing, And when the birds are gone through in the forest Our journey is happy about, In the desert we'll be and to have fatal eyes. It won't rise too easy,ến Dá 때아�енная, Thank you.
