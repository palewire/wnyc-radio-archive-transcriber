When you walk by a war bond, remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the boys overseas are giving their lives. You are only asked to lend your money. And on this theme, your city station microphones are set up at 29th Street and 7th Avenue on the southwest corner to bring you the ceremonies of the war bond rally of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry. Among the notable speakers to be heard will include our own mayor of the city of New York, the Honorable Fiorello H. Ligardia. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Henry H. Engel, who is chairman of this rally. Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed a privilege to present a great singing star who has graciously consented to be with us at this monster war bond rally. She has sung with the Metropolitan Opera Company, the San Francisco Opera Company, and is now one of the stars of that smash hit operetta, Rosalinda. It gives me great pleasure to present Miss Jean Merrill, who will sing our national anthem. The University of Henderson, the Parkview mere Gayle defied. mainly for the lovely hymn. Oh, say can you see by the dawn will be the light. What's the proof he الحis points? And my life's nervous gleaming, these thoughts on the prize draws through the perilous brite. Through the perilous fight The rampant we watched As the rampant is tearing On the rampant's red glare The bombs bursting in air Gain proof through the night That our flag was still there Oh, say, God, God, God, God And who is pain And the rampant's red And the rampant's red And who is pain Thank you, Ms. Merrill. And now, ladies and gentlemen, as chairman of this rally, I wish to present the chairman of the War Bond Committee of the War Emergency Board of the Fur Industry, Mr. George I. Fox. Ladies and gentlemen of the fur industry, I welcome you as chairman of the Bond Committee of the Fur Industry to this rally, which marks the opening of the greatest drive that the nation has attempted to raise a huge sum of $13 billion for the support of our boys in the field. The fur trade has placed itself to participate to the extent of $10 million in bond stores this drive. I'm sure that every one of us, both employers and employees alike, will do their share in participating in this privilege to share in the fight for freedom, democracy, and until victory is ours. I know the fur trade, then, will all to a man, will come along and not wait to be approached and coached to participate in this privilege. You'll come along from your own free will, buy bonds as much as you can, so that we can share in the effort until the Nazis and the fascists have been wiped off the earth. We have a very elaborate program prepared for you. We have some nationally known singers and some well-known speakers, among whom our very beloved mayor, the Honorable Fiorello Lagaria, will speak to you in a little while. And now I'm going to introduce to you the young man who will take over to be the master of ceremonies of this occasion, a man who is a nationally known artist, both on stage and screen, who has just come back from the coast, where he has entertained 195 camps. He is also appearing on the Campbell's program each Wednesday night. He is the star of the Siegfeld Follies. He's a man who gives of himself at all times that he's ever called upon to perform a duty for patriotic services and for very charitable causes. I give you the very fast-approaching number one comedian of the United States, our very beloved Milton Berle. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Fox, it's a wonderful announcement for a skin dealer. I'm very glad to be here today, ladies and gentlemen, on this wonderful rally. It's very nice and warm out here. I should have worn my earmuffs today. But I want to tell you... Pardon me, I just got up. It's a pleasure and a privilege, really. On behalf of the fur industry, and I'd like to be half of the fur industry, it's really a thrill to be up here on this rostrum with all these... I guess all you ladies and gentlemen in this very vast audience are wondering who these very, very gorgeous-looking ladies are here with the roses in their hands. May I say that these ladies, I'd like to introduce them, have them stand up and take a bow. They're all mothers of all the boys from the fur industry that are seeing service. Let's give them a swell hand. Here they are. Thank you very much, ladies. Thank you. You look very, very pretty. Very. I want to tell you that everybody's going to be here. The mayor, Mayor LaGuardia, was supposed to be here a little earlier, but he's tied up. He's playing bingo up in 48th Street, you see. If he's here, I'm kidding, Theorella. But I... Everybody, in fact, you know, the reason I'm here for another reason, I... I'm very, very glad because I have a brother. Mr. Fox, you can sit down. We saw your coat. Looks all right. Looks... Gets up and shows his coat. And, uh... Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf? I.J. Fox. I, um... No, pardon me. I mean George Fox. But it's really... My brother's in the fur industry. He's a caracal curler. Got a wonderful job. You know how you can curl caracal. They're curled already. Do I have to explain the jokes here today? But I want to tell you, it's really very, very... A big thrill, ladies and gentlemen, really, to be up in this pond. There is very... In fact, Eleanor Roosevelt was supposed to be here, but it was too near. And, uh... I'm a little tired out. I've been ironing all day and forging my ration card. And I want to tell you, it, uh... This is like trying to get laughs at a murder trial. Will you relax? Laugh when the world laughs with you. Try and they put you on a goodwill. I want to tell you... It's very, very difficult trying to get laughs when there's subway going underneath you here. But I want to tell you that I would like to introduce... I would like. I would like to go back to sleep. I would like to introduce... I'm really... I'm tired, really. I'm very happy, though, today. It's my anniversary. I've been married a year today. I don't know what to get my wife. She wants a man. I, um... Oh, now you laugh. I like that, uh... Our New York finest, all these very fine policemen are doing a wonderful job here this afternoon. I want, I think, a swell hand for the New York's finest, boys. Let's give... Let's give all the boys a hand. Except the guy up on 34th Street wouldn't let me through. And if he can hear me, I mean it. He said, get out, get out there. He's a Harvard man. And, uh... No, all kidding aside, all these fellas... I played a cop in my last picture. I made a picture called Margin for Error. Who saw the picture? Anybody see it? Three, four, five. Thank you. You did. Hello, Ben. I'm glad to see you. Ben Platt's here. I guess he wants me to mention his name. I mentioned it. Now you go back to your store. All right. I played a cop in that picture and I had the most important part in that picture in Margin for Error. Joan Bennett, she's in the picture too and I have the most important part. At the beginning of the picture, I open the door and let Joan Bennett in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. If I don't open the door, she's not in the picture. That's the end of the joke. What do you want? Gasoline? Relax. May I present... May I present as our first surprise, ladies and gentlemen, may I present as our first surprise some kids from CCNY waving to me over there. How are you, kid? Fine. How are you? I'm playing hooky, huh? May I present four boys, ladies and gentlemen, that are from our very fine United States Coast Guard and all of them have seen action and fighting. One gentleman who was the head of the Southerners, Mr. Homer Smith.

job In its war effort activities It has sponsored The previous war bond drive The salvage drive The blood donors drive And through its war chest Recently distributed $250,000 To war relief agencies Of the allied nations The board's greatest gesture Was the creation Of the fur vest project Which is now Of national scope And operation Thousands of fur line vests Have been distributed To brave merchant seamen Of the allied merchant marine And this project Is to be continued Indefinitely To ensure a steady flow Of these vests For the duration Of the war This project Was made possible Through the patriotism And generosity Of the fur workers Many of you Within the hearing Of my voice Are giving unstintingly Of your time and labor For this most worthy cause And I'm sure You'll continue to do so We are here today To ask you To make another contribution But one which will not require Your time Or even effort The United States government Is asking you To put your money Into the finest And safest investment In the world Not only will you receive A good rate of interest And ensure yourself Against poverty And distress In the years to come But these bonds Will pay big dividends In victory Freedom And the peaceful Pursuit of happiness Bring those boys Over there back quicker By backing them up With your dollars Over here And now it is my extreme pleasure To present to you A dynamic personality A real friend Of the fur industry A man who has been Untiring In his duty And devotion To his country And his city His honor The mayor of New York Fiorella LaGuardia Mr. Chairman Benny Who said this was A ghost town I wish Some of these employers Were trying to bring back Starvation wages And the sweatshops And Macy's And Bloomingdale's And Abraham and Strauss Could come here And see this ground And incidentally While we're fighting This war We are not going to permit Labor standards To be brought down Now let Bloomingdale And Macy And Abraham and Strauss And Lord and Taylor Take note of that And perhaps Look at their own payrolls And give their employees A better birth You know Ben Gold asked me To come here To make an appeal For this Second war loan And after he asked me To come here And make the appeal He just now told me You're oversubscribed Already And of course I know That the fur industry Will come through As they always do You know As I said last night At Carnegie Hall The matter's very simple We either Loan the money To our government And get it back With interest Or else Hitler and the Japs Will come over here And take it away from us We get nothing And we're not going to Let them come over here And that is why We want to make this Second war loan Not only successful We want to Oversubscribe it And I am sure That the flourishing Prospering Great industrial town Of New York Will lead the whole procession Now of course We have no illusions About this men It's going to be A long And difficult War There's no doubt As to the outcome But we must do A complete job And that means That there is a great deal Of hard and difficult Fighting ahead The news this week Is rather encouraging The French The British And our American troops Are chasing Rummel And his army Into the waters Of the Bay of Tunis The army Of the Soviet Republicans Are pushing back Every attempt Of the Nazi forces To break through Again The Russian army Has now The Nazi army In the mud Up to their knees And pretty soon They'll have them In the mud Up to their necks It wasn't so many weeks ago When Hitler Was making preparations For his march Into Moscow And as I told you At the meeting Madison Square Garden The only time The Nazi army Will see Moscow Will be when they'll be Taken there As prisoners of war And yet As I say There's a great deal More fighting To be done And we have to fight Until We've beaten And crushed And destroyed And destroyed The Japs Hitler And his little pal Mussolini too None of them Are any good And never were Any good And some of us Knew that They were no good All of the time So I want to congratulate The fur industry Of New York City Employers And the organized Workers Of the fur industry In getting An early start In this War loan In setting the example To other industries And I know That you'll make good For your country This time As you always Make good This war Is not only For our protection It's for a better world To bring

Secondly, let me inform you that you stay down, and if you get into the shop a half hour or more later, you will be permitted to work it off, so stay until the meeting is over. And thirdly, let's see whether we can take our hands out of our pockets, all of us here. This is not just a meeting for the speakers from the platform. This is a meeting where all of you will have to speak. Those of you on the sides, all over, take your hands out of your pockets, and the rest of you to the right of me and those in the front. Let the gentlemen from the Treasury Department, let the United States government representatives know that you are here not only to listen to speeches, but you are here to demonstrate your readiness to support with money and with everything until we smash Hitlerism and wipe them off the face of the earth. Get your hands out and put them up. And this pledge to the United States government representatives here. Let's see your hands. Take them out of your pockets. Let's see this pledge from everybody here at this audience. Come up with your hands. Take them out. They won't freeze. All over, down the other side. Express your opinion and your determination. Next, you have on this platform, her workers, women, mothers, members of our union, workers in this industry who have given their sons in the United States armed forces, some of them two sons, some of them three, some of them their sons and daughters, some of them sitting on this platform, your sisters working with you in your shops, members of your union, have had their sons over on the other side, who have already made their supreme sacrifice, who have already laid down their lives so that you and I and the rest of us in this world may live free of the boot of Hitler. They are right here, the mothers, your sisters, and your fellow members of your union and your industry. You have here a mother of a hero. You have read the newspapers only the other day of a member of our union, a young worker by the name of Abrams, who was a lieutenant in one of the bombers fortresses that sunk three German ships in the Atlantic. That hero's mother is right here on this platform. These mothers have given their sons, and the United States Treasury Department is calling upon us to give money to buy bonds so that the United States Government may be able to buy the best the best that the American people and the American workers can produce, the best ships, the best trains, the best tanks and guns to their sons and the sons of millions more to put an end to Hitlerism, to put an end to slavery, to bring about the world free of the threats, free of the slavery imposed by Hitler on the conquered people. To bring about a better and freer world for all of us. These are the mothers here who have sent their sons for that purpose. Last night, the secretary of the president, Mr. Morgan Cowell spoke at Carnegie Hall. And his opening remarks, when he opened the speech, he said, the second friend is no military secret. We all know that just over the horizon, we of the United Nations are piling up the sun, the sun, the clouds of the greatest attack in history. Now we are ready to deal a few blows ourselves. And there will be blows that I can promise that will rock Nazi Germany to its rotten, blood-stained foundation. The secretary of the president, the secretary of the United States government, the cabinet member of our government, opened the speech last night with a statement that we are ready and this second war bond drive is raised in order to make possible the invasion of Europe, of our brave American boys, of the heroic boys of the British Army, of the heroic people and army of the Soviet Union, in one mighty invasion of Europe that will once and for all put an end to Hitlerism and his slavery. And it is these bonds that we made you to buy today that will give the answer of the American government that will give and give and give in every way possible to make possible the realization of the invasion of Europe to make possible victory over Hitlerism in 1943. Now, it is my job and present job to introduce to you the next and last speaker, one who has inspired and led our union with its 80,000 members all over the United States and Canada to make a record of war activities that is a shining example for the entire labor movement in this country. One who has inspired and led to the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States. One who is the inspirer of 7,000 members of our union who are today in the armed forces and who inspires these 7,000 members to fight in the front ranks of the American armed forces and who will give an account of themselves in the same manner and even more ironically and even with greater sacrifice. One who has inspired and the membership of our union that has stayed behind to support them on this side. One who has inspired and the fact that it gives me pleasure to introduce to you, the president of the International Foreign-Lower Workers Union, Ben Goh. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Tables are definitely turning, slowly but surely. Not long ago, Hitler and his chiefs were bragging about the superiority of the German weapons. Today, it is generally recognized that our country alone succeeded in outproducing the Nazis. To the decree that even the Nazis recognized this fact, both in quality and quantity, our weapons are superior to the Nazis' murderous weapons. Not long ago, the entire world was trembling with fear at the threat of Hitler that he is going to continue bombing London to a shambles. Today, the situation is entirely different. Our liberators and fortresses and the Spitfires and the Russian Sturmawiks are bombing Germany without a stop. And he feels the taste of his blitzkrieg methods. Not long ago, Churchill, in his speech stated to the British people that the only thing that he can offer them is sweat and tears and blood. Today, Hitler and Göttingen, the German people, the German people, the German people of blood and tears and sweat. Not long ago, all of us were afraid that Hitler might carry out his threat to invade the British army. Today, there is a great deal of talk about invasion, but the invasion of the United Nations and the European continent that will catch Hitler in our most brutal milkcracker in the history of military matters. On the one side, our boys and the British boys. On the other side, the glorious Red Army that will split the Nazi army and annihilate it until the Casablanca decision of unconditional surrender will become a fact. Until recently, Hitler kept on talking of speedy victory. Now, in our ranks, the force in a speedy victory. We are darn interested in that victory. Come as soon as possible. We can't afford to prevent this war too long. It is no more that great, invincible, Nazi cannibal army that threatened the entire world. The Minas de la Beric and the Soviet Russian battlefields will never fight again on the side of the Nazis. In order to carry through the great fight of mankind, we must make every effort to help our government, help the armed forces of the United Nations to make that possible. And we gather today publicly and officially to reassure our decision and make it clear that we are ready and willing and eager to back up that decision by action. Now, we are opening the great campaign for $13 billion bonds. And the fair workers who hate fascism, who hate reaction, who despise oppression, who are always on the job to fight for democracy and freedom and the rights of labor and the well-being of our nation, are called today to make the opening. The international union intends to develop an intensive campaign to contribute $2 million to this fund to buy bonds. I ask, is there a motion to instruct the General Executive Board to develop the campaign among its members for $2 million? In this month, is there a motion to that effect? Is there any seconder to the motion? Regularly moved and seconded to instruct and empower the General Executive Board of the International Union to develop the campaign to develop the campaign for $2 million? War bonds. All in favor. Signify parasing your hand and keep it up. Keep it up. Keep it up. Let's have a picture so that we can see it, whether there is a unanimous decision. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Beat marks now. Okay, man. Done. Any opposed? Raise your hand. And this is the unanimous decision that we again serve no rest on the cannabis and on the appeasers and the agents of Hitler that we are ready to fight to the last trap of blood to annihilate the Nazis for the victory of the civilized world. At this time, may I ask you to take your heads off? I introduce... Ladies and gentlemen, with this unanimous decision of the fur industry to back the second war loan of the United States government, we bring to a close this program of which has been taken part at the 29th Street, 7th Avenue corner, at which point the war emergency port of the fur industry has held its war bond rally. Among the speakers that were heard on today's program was his honor, the mayor of the city of New York, Mayor LaGuardia. Milton Burrell served as emcee for part of the program. Henry Engel, chairman of the war bond rally committee of the fur industry. George I. Fox, chairman of the war bond committee. Lou White, chairman of the war emergency board of the fur industry. And Gene Merrill, that is, a metropolitan opera star who sang the Star Spangled Banner and the Army Air Corps song. And also, we just heard from the president of the Furious Union, Ben Gold. Ladies and gentlemen, we, before we leave, remind you that once again, when you buy bonds, you are only lending your money while your own brothers, sons, and husbands are giving their lives. And so, on the theme of any bonds today, we conclude this program, which has been a public service feature of your city station. This is the municipal broadcasting system. Thank you. Thank you.
