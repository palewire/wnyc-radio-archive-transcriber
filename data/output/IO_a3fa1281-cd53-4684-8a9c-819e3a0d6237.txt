The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay I hear the song, I hear the bugle calling Goodbye, darling, babe Goodbye, darling, I must leave you Though it breaks my heart to go Something tell me, I am near the end Tell me, I am near the end of the end of the end of the indefinitely Tell me if I know what to do, the waż정's hope Tell me I am pleased and I am knitting To fight the foe Therefore, my hero is a number of men I'm asking and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling. Goodbye, darling, pray. Come on down south, way, way down south. Where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew. And all the birds are singing queer and queer and gay. Come on, come on along. Come on, join in the song. Jump on, fall in. It won't be long. We're on our way. Hip, hip, hooray. We're going downtown. Hoo, way. Hanson snakes the heart grow thunder. Hoo, hoo, hoo. Ooh, hoo. Hanson snakes the heart grow thunder. Ooh, hoo, hoo. Hanson snakes the heart grow thunder. Ooh, hoo, hoo. Ooh, hoo, hoo. Ooh, hoo, hoo. Hanson snakes the heart grow thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the night I thunder. Wondering, darling, if you're true. Blinds the heart grow thunder. Distance only lands and shone's end. Though the ocean waves divide. Absence makes the heart grow thunder. Longing to be near you Be near your heart She was happy till she met you And the fault is all your own If she wishes to forget you You will please leave her alone She has come to her old mother Just because there is no other She'll be happy in her own sweet home When the harvest days are over Yes, she is here Christ, she is here And the sun gets flowers No, she dies so free She dies so free You will see the word you said That's the time we do shall wear When the harvest days are over Just be near My just be near Happy Can you hear or nothing Oh, I'd like you to stay The baby was off with a strawberry dog And the band played on He's like a blossom flower With a trail he adored And the band played on But his brain was so loaded It nearly exploded The poor girl would shake me along He's a girl with a strawberry girl And the band played on Sweet Adeline My Adeline At night, dear heart For you I found In all my dreams In all my dreams Your fair-faced be Your fair-faced be You're the flower of my heart Sweet Adeline We are all my dreams We are all my heart We are all my heart We are all my dreams He's only a man in a fearless pain, a beautiful sight to fear. You may think he's happy and free from care, he's not a both he seems to be. He's done when you think of a wasted life, for you cannot make me wait. And her beauty was sold for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a gilded hay. A little brown car, a shady green spot. So happier home I find. My heart's barely gone, I love only one. She's the girl I have to be mine. Just one girl, only just one girl. Where on earth I know what's there not my heart. The Lord reigns me in just one place. I'll be happy forever, Christian. I'll be happy forever, Christian. Wonder. I'll be happy forever, Christian. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder. Wonder.
