And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabelle de Bore, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. I Don't know what SAR's guilty of nothing and love is plenty for me. I got no car, got no mule, I got no misery. The folks with their kids and their kids, got a lock on the door. Pray somebody's a-goin' for a problem, but without a-make-in-more. What for, what for? I got a lock on the door, that's the way to be. They can see the cross on the floor, that's okay to be. For the things that I try, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's ready for me. I got my gals, got my song, her head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I got my gals, got my lord, got my song. I got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I can't the sun, can't the moon, can't the people see. The folks with plenty of plenty, God will pray all the day. Keeps the plenty, if you're not the warrior, keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, in a time to ride Never was it long as I'm well Never was it tried to be good, to be bad What the hell are you glad I'm a boy?
