The End I see. And we here at the newsroom have a later report, supposedly originating with the police department at the scene, that 33 persons were removed from the plane before it went down, and that a 34th, the captain of the commercial airliner, has been rescued by still another police launch. Do you have any information about that, sir? We haven't as yet received any reports from our launchers at the scene. I see. They're out of an emergency and they're working and they can't give us a full report until they've completed their job. All right. Can I call you back, say, in about 20 minutes or so?

Patrolman Roney, this is radio station WNYC newsroom calling. Yep. Is the patrol helicopter that flew over the crash scene of the commercial airliner in the East River back at base yet? No, I believe they're out of LaGuardia now. They're out of LaGuardia? Yeah. I just phoned LaGuardia, and they told me possibly it would be at the airbase. No, it wouldn't be back here. It would be somewhere up around the scene. Can you give me the name of the pilot of the plane? Yeah. Acting Sergeant Harold Behrens. B-E-H-R-E-N-S. B-E-H-R-E-N-S. Harold? Harold, yeah. Behrens. Yep. Uh-huh. And did he have a co-pilot? Yes. Thomas Williams. Thomas Williams? Right. And he is a pilot? A co-pilot. Co-pilot. Right. A patrolman, is that? Thomas Williams?

Thanks very much. Right. Right. Right. Right. Hello, this is WNYC radio station Newsroom. Who is this, please? This is Captain Jensen speaking. Captain Jensen? That's all right. Where were you this morning, sir, when that plane crashed in the East River? Well, we were probably about 1,000 feet away at the time. We were at our stateboat. We have a stateboat out here that we use to moor our scours to, and I was tied up there waiting for the tide to come up a little bit more to get two sand scours into flushing. I see. And what happened? So when she crashed, we were right there. Uh, what happened? And we came right out to the plane right away, but we had a little tough time driving us through the mud there. It's about half tired, see? Yes, I see. Well, we finally made it and got the tug right up to that plane, and I'll come back. What happened when you got to the plane? Well, when we got there, there was people holding onto the wings of the plane and the fuselage, and then there was a crash boat from the, some airplane company over here in College Point. Edo, I guess they called it. Edo. And she got there just ahead of us, right in front of us, and they were taking people off because I couldn't maneuver the tug much around there, and we had the tug up to the plane, the wing of the plane, and we were taking the people off the wing. I guess we took off about six people, I guess. And this crash boat, he got in close to where the other people were hanging onto the fuselage, and then he transplanted them to us. I transport them to us, see? And then we put them inside where it was warm and gave them blankets and coffee and things like that. Come back. How many people did you take aboard your ship altogether? Hello? Come back again, please. I said, how many people did you take aboard your ship altogether? We had 26 men and 5 women. 26 men and 5 women, that would make 31, is that correct? That's correct. And would you say there were about 3 or 4 or more taken aboard the other ship? No, we had them all. We had them all. They put them all aboard us, as far as I know, the 31. But the two pilots, we left on the plane, and they were chopping a hole on the top of the plane to see if there was anybody else left in there. You know? Come back. Well, we have a report here that as of now, 34 have been rescued and two are still missing. Over. I see. Well, that's about right, I guess. That's about right. Because the pilots, they said they figured there was two people in the plane yet. You know? Come back. What was the reaction of the passengers after you picked them up? Very good. Very good. Except that, of course, there were a lot of them, most of them all, were suffering from shock and exposure. The water was very cold. It was lucky it was a warm day. But they were all shivering, and some of them were injured, too. I mean, cuts and bleeding. But they did a magnificent job. No excitement or no hysterics or anything like that. And these five women, they were wonderful. They didn't get hysterical or anything. And they were pretty badly injured, some of them, too, by cuts and bruises, you know? Come back. And what happened when you reached College Point? Well, we came over to College Point with them just as soon as they could. And we called the Coast Guard across from the police department so they'd have ambulances over here and doctors. So we got in here just before, well, before the doctors got in. The doctors got in here just about five or ten minutes after we got in. And then the police department and all was here, too. Because this is a police station right here at College Point Ferry. Come back. Are you at College Point right now? That is correct. We are at College Point Ferry. I see. And how many other people are aboard your tug besides yourself? Well, there were about nine more people aboard. Our general manager, our general manager, is aboard now. But there was about nine men aboard the tug when the accident happened. Come back. And they all helped to rescue the people from the airplane? That is correct. We threw life preservers to the ones that we couldn't come to right away. And then we threw even lines and pulled some of them through the water there so they got aboard the boat and they all come back. Did you have any facilities for medical aid to those who were injured? In other words, did you have blankets and other facilities aboard your tug? I tried. I tried. We had plenty of blankets and we gave them blankets and we gave them hot coffee. And put them in where it was warm in our galley and in the engine room and down our focus hole, which was all nice and warm. But they were exposed to that cold water and some of them were pretty well shot, you know. We had to take two across ashore and stretch to the police boat to come back. In other words, there are possibly two of those you rescued who are really seriously injured and the rest are not too seriously injured. Is that correct? That is correct. I don't think any of them are too seriously injured. All right, sir. And you are aboard the tug Bill Ender, E-N-D-T-E-R. Is that right? That is correct. And your full name is what? Captain? My name? Yes, sir. Your full name? My full name is E-A-R-L-E-R-L-G-E-N-S-E-N. And are you from New York City, sir? Flushing, Long Island. You're from Flushing. And how long have you been on a tugboat or captain of a tugboat? All for about 28 years. 28 years. Would you say you had anything similar in your past 28 years? No, I haven't. No, I haven't. I've rescued a few people from drowning that are single people. And excursion boat up in the North River here when I was working for McAllister here a few years back. And broke down. We put her into our berths and got some of the people off. But that's about all, I guess. I see. Where is the wreckage of the plane right now as far as you know? Why, it's about abreast. It's almost abreast of College Point Ferry between College Point Ferry and Rikers Island. Was it towed out of the way or is it the same place where it crashed? Oh, it's in the same place as where it crashed. I see, sir. And as of now, what is happening at College Point? Can you tell me that? Well, right now, of course, the ambulance are all gone and the people, I mean, the people that were rescued are all taken off now. And they're in the hospital by now. And, of course, there's the police around yet. The police commissioner himself was here a while back when, right after the accident happened, when we brought the people in. And he went out on a police boat. And they're right now out to the wreck, which I can see from here, where there's Coast Guard out there and a number of police boats. And I think somebody from the DA is out there now, too. Come back. I see. In other words, various officials of different departments of government are at the scene at the moment. Is that correct? That is correct. All right, Captain Earl Jensen, thanks very much for giving us information about this plane crash of a commercial airliner this morning in the East River off Rikers Island. Thank you very much, sir.
