Ladies and gentlemen, the city of New York today salutes Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski, the noble patriot who gave his life in the struggle for American independence. On this 201st anniversary of his birth and the 10th anniversary of the invasion of Poland, I know that I speak for all the people in New York in expressing our sincere gratitude and best wishes to the people of Polish descent who have contributed so much to the growth and welfare of our city. I call upon everyone to participate in this observance of Pulaski Memorial Day.
