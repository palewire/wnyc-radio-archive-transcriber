The Northwestern University Reviewing Stand. Does the Fact-Finding Board have a place in settling labor disputes? Northwestern University, in cooperation with the Mutual Broadcasting System, presents by transcription the Reviewing Stand, a program in its 16th year on the air. Today the Reviewing Stand takes a critical look at the Fact-Finding Board. Our unrehearsed give-and-take discussion will center around the methods used by the Board in dealing with labor disputes and the Board's effectiveness as a procedure for settling labor management differences. Now our moderator, Leighton Boren, Director of the Reviewing Stand, will introduce participants in today's discussion. Mr. Boren. Someone has said the only sure things in this world are taxes, deaths, and labor disputes. Today there is a Chrysler strike. Tomorrow we may see a rail strike, a shipping strike, or even another coal strike. With this continuing friction between management and labor, there have been feverish attempts to prevent serious workshop stoppages in the nation's industries. One procedure that has been developed and used with increasing frequency is the Fact-Finding Board. This tool was twice tested under fire within the past year in nationwide strikes in coal and steel. With us today are men who served on these two Fact-Finding Boards. Carol Dogherty, member of the Steel Fact-Finding Board, and W. Willard Wertz, member of the Coal Fact-Finding Board, both of the faculty of Northwestern University. To complete our panel, we welcome a prominent spokesman for industry, William Capels, Manager of Industrial Relations for the Inland Steel Company. Dargetty, you served on the Fact-Finding Board appointed by President Truman during the Steel Crisis. Can you give us the inside story on how a Fact-Finding Board operates? Well, the Steel Fact-Finding Board was set up by the President of the United States about the middle of July, following a threatened Steel Strike. This Board was asked by the President to inquire into the merits of the issues in dispute and to make fair and equitable recommendations in connection therewith. The Board heard each side in the dispute for about nine days. Thereafter, it wrote a report which it presented to the President on September 10th. The issues in dispute were wage rate increase, medical and hospitalization benefits, and retirement benefits. The report recommended that the wage rate increase demand be withdrawn, and made certain recommendations in respect to the other two, which were about midway between what the company's position was and the union's position. After the recommendations were presented to the President, there followed a period of negotiation, and ultimately the parties were unable to agree, so that there was a Steel Strike. So that we get a picture of the Fact-Finding Board in operation on another front, I should like to ask Wirtz, what happened in the coal dispute? Well, the Board set up in the coal case was set up under the Taft-Hartley Act. It's a very different kind of animal from the one that Doherty has described. It is not really a Fact-Finding Board at all. Technically, it's called a Board of Inquiry. The Board meets for only four or five days. There have been eight of these Boards during the last two or three years. We met in the coal case for four days, heard the parties for a couple of days, and then wrote our report, and that's all there was to it. We had no authority to make any recommendations at all. We had authority only to find the facts in the case and to report those to the President. There was no mediation, no arbitration, no recommendation. I don't think most people realize, Boren, that there was no point in this recent coal dispute at which any recommendation was made to either of the parties or to both of them by any government representative. It is outside the authority of the Board of Inquiry under the statute to make any recommendation. Then the chief distinction between the Fact-Finding Board's action in the coal and steel strikes was the fact that in one we had a recommendation, and in the other we did not. Is that true? That's correct. Are there any other differences that you'd like to point out between the activities of the two Boards in these two situations? Well, there's a lawyer's difference, and I suppose it's more than of legal importance. The law provides for the setting up of a Taft-Hartley Act Board of Inquiry. The kind of fact-finding board with which Doherty was the chairman in the steel case can be set up only on the recommendation of the President and with the approval of both parties. There's no statutory force behind it at all. We've been talking on this business of how the fact-finding board works. I'm wondering if, from your experience, you can give us an evaluation of the success of the board in these two situations. Doherty, how successful was your board in solving this steel strike? Well, it's a difficult question to answer. In the sense of doing the job that we were set up for, namely the prevention of a work stoppage, the board was not successful. On the other hand, in the sense of making recommendations which ultimately were the basis for a settlement after the strike, I should say that the board was successful. I'm going to ask you a rather embarrassing question, and you need not answer it if you wish. It was said, I think, during the steel strike that the fact-finding board was set up to pay Murray a political debt. Is that true? Well, I don't know why the board was set up. I wouldn't presume to answer whether the board was set up to repay a political debt or not. But I do want to make this quite clear. Once the board was in operation, there was no hint or suggestion from any source in Washington as to what the recommendation should be or what our procedure should be. As a poor party to the steel, the fact-finding proceeding, I want to say this from an industry standpoint. We believe that within the views of the men who sat on that board, that they handed down a perfectly honest opinion, regardless of what politics might or might not have been. Well, Capels, you've heard, uh, Doggerty and Wirtz talking here about the fact-finding board. Do you think it's a pretty good way of approaching these disputes between labor and industry? No, I do not. And I don't for this reason. There is one basic thing in fact-finding if it is to be successful. That is, if it's to stop a labor dispute. The fact-finders must take something away from the employer, little enough so that he will not afford to take a strike, and it must give the union enough so that they can't afford to pull their members out on strike. Now, you believe that it's always a compromise procedure then? No, I think this. It means that the union must get something. And that precludes the very real possibility that an employer can be entirely right in saying no to every demand of a union. Well, Capels, is that pattern any different from the pattern which has developed in private collective bargaining during the past 10 or 15 years? Is there some basis for your suggestion that there is more likely to be a compromise in connection with fact-finding than there is in connection with private collective bargaining? Yes, I think that in fact finding there is always going to be a compromise. That is not necessarily true in collective bargaining. For instance, take the northern textile industry, which recently has settled or extended agreements without increasing wage rates. Now, there was a solution without a change in the conditions of the employer and the employee. Am I wrong in thinking that that settlement came as the result of private arbitration? No, you're not. That did come in some instances, maybe in all, as a result of private arbitration, but not as a result of fact-finding. But it was a case in which a third party, entirely stranger to the dispute, and only a public representative, in a sense, did make a decision, which in no way included an element of compromise. Yes, I think to be technical, that's correct. Caples, you wouldn't suggest that there is anything inherently wrong in compromise, would you? I mean, it's my feeling, I feel rather strongly that compromise is an essential part of democracy. When one side has its own way, either side, you get something that smacks rather of authoritarianism. Well, I think that we live by compromise, otherwise we'd live in eternal conflict. But, who is the party to make the compromise? In a fact-finding situation, we bring strangers in to try and settle a dispute which the parties themselves cannot settle. Now, the parties are more familiar with the job conditions, the shop conditions, every condition, than any stranger can be. I think we tried to point that out in the Steele case, that, honorable as the board was, that they were strangers to our people and to our plans. They have to be. John Lewis pointed that out when Mr. Truman offered him a fact-finding board of the Steele type, that he was not going to let his members' destiny be controlled by strangers. I'm more or less of the same mind, that the people themselves who know the situation best should make the compromises, if compromises can be made. Well, don't you think that the fact-finding board can act as a representative of public interest? In most of these disputes, we really don't have a representative of the public. Can the fact-finding board fill that role, Capels? Well, I've never understood what the public is. We all think we're part of the public, and we undoubtedly are. I don't think the public is any one segment of the population. It's all of the population. Now, who represents the public? The unions claim they're the public. We claim in management, we're the public. Then there's some third vague person to the public. I don't think it's a question of bringing the public in. I don't think you can do it. I don't think it's a matter of a vague third-person, Capels. I think it's a matter of a clear and distinct interest. A consumer interest or a purchaser interest, if you will, which is very different from the producer interest, which both the union and the management in some of these cases represent. Yes, but won't the consumer discipline us for our mistakes in bargaining just like they discipline us for our mistakes in making bad product or making product at too high a cost or anything else? The public, the consuming public, if we're struck long enough, they'll find other suppliers. Or if they don't like our labor policies, they'll buy other products of other manufacturers. The public can discipline us without fact-finding. Well, suppose I make an attempt arbitrarily to define the public as being everybody who's not immediately involved in a strike. Now, in a situation where a strike does threaten, where sides have taken rather diametrically opposed views, isn't it true that each side recognizes the force of public opinion and tries to influence it? It's a vague thing, but nevertheless, very real, this public opinion. And each side, well, they make newspaper advertisements, they issue statements, hold press conferences, and so on. Now, this public, the man in the street, I feel, has not a very good way of discovering where the truth lies between the probably exaggerated claims of the participants, who in trying to be emphatic may not tell the whole story as even they see it. A fact-finding board, it seems to me, comes in and acts as the agent. As Judge Rosemond said, the eyes and ears of the public. And tries to winnow out the truth of the situation in an unbiased way and inform the people that it's representing about the merits of the issues as the board sees it. May I say that in connection with that, I should want to be among the first to suggest that the board of inquiry in the Cole case did not perform the function which you, Doggerty, outlined. I'd like to make it as clear as I possibly can that there are in my mind two very distinct kinds of fact-finding here. And while I have a substantial feeling of support for the kind of fact-finding which you had in the Steele case, and which did the things which Doggerty has just outlined, I find myself feeling with capos that if by fact-finding we mean only the sort of futile function in which we participated in connection with the Cole case, I should feel that to stay out would be as well, or it would be as well as being a good thing. as to get in on the basis which we did. Yes, well that underlines a point that I wanted to make. If a fact-finding board doesn't have the power to make recommendations, to give the public the benefit of its presumed expertness and knowledge in the field, I think that it performs a rather futile function. But I want to bring out one thing, that the minute you substitute the judgment of fact-finders for the judgment of management, you're accepting a new theory of how we run an economy. Managers are appointed to preserve a business and run it to the best of their judgment. They're put in there because they are thought to have judgment. Now, if they are substituted by fact-finders who make decisions without any responsibility for carrying the decisions out, they don't have to live with them, then you're saying in effect that that function of management we will take and throw aside and substitute fact-finders because it's in the public interest. Well that position seems to me to be so completely well taken that I should want to make my position a little clearer. I should agree that that would be the only principle on which we could operate in every case except those one or two or three cases a year in which for some reason or other the judgment of the managers and of the unions has resulted in their reaching an impasse that doesn't give us any out. Your concern then works about the basic industries largely. I think it's a terrible thing for strangers to decide disputes. We're talking about a council of desperation. We have two or three times a year a situation on our hands where we've got to take desperate measures. I want to make quite clear that I agree 100% with that position. I do not wish to see fact-finding boards set up in any but the basic industries and their emergency situations. Then in the small industries you would not use the fact-finding board as an instrument. Is that true? That's true. Of course the minute that both Doggerty and Wirtz say that they are for fact-finding, they have to assume that fact-finding admits a failure of collective bargaining. As Wirtz says, when union and management cannot agree, in other words, when collective bargaining has failed, then we have fact-finding. Now, I don't know if we're going to cure anything with fact-finding. Is there a basic evil? I don't think we're going to cure anything. I think all we can possibly expect from any of these things that we're considering is that we'll work out something that'll get us over a hump that comes up every once in a while. I don't think they have any long-range constructive value. They are emergency measures. And you think they should be a part of our labor law. Is that right, Wirtz? Oh, I expect that if this thing is going to be worked out successfully, there'll have to be some statutory provision for it. That introduces a variety of possibilities. I don't believe that we can avoid some kind of statutory coverage of the problem. I think I should put Dargity on the spot here for just a moment. If you had the power to construct labor legislation for some of these problems, what kind of laws would you like to see in effect, Dargity? Well, if I may have a moment to develop my position, I'd be glad to do so. It seems to me, on the one hand, at the one extreme, you have a completely hands-off attitude by government, such as Mr. Capel's wishes to have. Now, this approach has very definite advantages. The main one is that it places squarely on the shoulders of the parties where it belongs the necessity for having an agreement, coming to an agreement. It places on their shoulders as a responsibility for practicing this democratic principle of compromise. As a matter of fact, the threat of strike and lockout are forces which help to bring about the compromise, because the parties would rather come to an agreement than to risk, usually, the losses involved in a work stoppage. But in a basic industry like coal, public utilities, railroads, perhaps steel, there is the very definite cost involved of having the national health and welfare either immediately threatened or subject to a creeping economic paralysis. And to me, that's a very serious cost in those industries to pay for the freedom of collective bargaining that we all wish to see. Now, at the other end of the scale, at the other extreme, there's compulsory arbitration. Nobody's advocating that here today, but it has been advocated frequently. Waiving the question as to whether or not you can enforce the awards made under compulsory arbitration. As you know, under compulsory arbitration, the submission of the dispute and the recommendations are made compulsory. Waiving the question as to whether or not you can enforce the awards, there is the very definite, and that's a very moot point, I might say, there's a very definite advantage of ensuring a steady flow of commodities and services from the producers to the consumers. But that's accompanied by very serious costs also. It means, if my observation is correct, a withering away of collective bargaining. Why? Because either of the parties, or both the parties, think they'll get a better deal in the arbitration court set up by the government. They transfer their energies and their activities from the economic field and from bargaining to trying to control the arbitration court and trying to be the government. I think that's a very serious thing. I think that although those countries such as Australia and New Zealand don't yield anyone in the practice of political democracy, they lose the practice of democracy where it means the most directly in bargaining between management and labor. And to me that's too big a cost to pay for having a free and unimpeded flow of commodities to the consumer. There's even another cost. Inevitably, almost, those governments get into price fixing of one kind or another and make even more economic decisions and take the economic decisions away from private enterprise. So it seems to me that the best thing we can do is to try to find some middle ground method under which most of the advantages of those other extremes are preserved and most of their costs or disadvantages are removed. So I would recommend two things. I would recommend that the prestige of government be put behind the writing into of private collective bargaining agreements of provisions for private voluntary arbitration, which is a very different thing from compulsory arbitration. Under voluntary arbitration, the parties themselves agree to submit the unsettled items and new agreements to private arbitration. I assume from what you've said previously, Caples, that you would put fact finders like Doggerty and Wirtz here on the list of the unemployed. Is that true? Heaven forbid such able men being on the unemployed list, but not as fact finders. I wouldn't keep them employed. I think, as Wirtz said earlier, he said that fact finding boards are things of expediency. And I agree with that. Now expedients are never any good. What you want to do is cure a basic cause. And I think that instead of fact finding boards, if we looked at the causes of labor disputes, in other words, national labor disputes, the thing we're talking about now, which is coal, steel, and possibly some other industries, how do these things come about? They come about because one union and one man has the power to stop either a form of energy or a metal coming into the public. Now I think that if a restraint was placed upon the labor leaders, that is, the leaders of organized labor, the same restraint that's placed upon business, that they could not combine if such combination was in restraint of trade. In other words, if they could only strike a small portion of any business at any time, then we would have no need for fact finding. Let me try to point that out in an example. There is no coal mine or coal company in the United States which, by itself, whether it works or does not work, affects the national economy in any way. But when you take all coal and through one union stop all coal production at once, then it becomes a great problem to the economy and the nation, and we start looking for solutions. But you still wouldn't use the fact finding for it? No, I say the solution is a curb of power, not fact finding. How would you go about curbing the power of your labor unions? More in the way of labor laws and regulations? No, I don't think so. I'm not very much of a believer that you can have good labor relations by law. I do believe that the way to do it is through a restriction of power. In other words, if unions were subject to laws similar to the antitrust laws, the laws that regulate the power of business, that we'd solve a lot of our difficulties right there. For instance, you mentioned earlier the Chrysler strike. Now, Chrysler's a big company. He says that he doesn't want labor relations governed by law except the right kind of law, which would be a law, if I understand him, a law which would break up large-scale collective bargaining. Frankly, if I had the world to make over, I'd make it in awfully small pieces. And there would be small unions and there would be small corporations, too. I'm just afraid that we're past that point. I should like just very briefly to toss out this suggestion. It follows, I suppose, rather closely along the lines that Doherty has drawn in general. I should start with a proposition that all except two or three collective bargaining disputes, which are likely to arise in the country in any given year, will be worked out without the necessity of resort to fact-finding or any other kind of law. Last year, it was the steel case and the coal case. Next year, it may be these two industries or others. I should like to see the situation, one in which the president would have authority, by statute, I suppose, to convene, when one of these two or three major disputes threatened each year, an emergency board, I think in terms of a nine-man board, the Chamber of Commerce head, the National Association of Manufacturers head, and perhaps the Secretary of Commerce on the labor side, the CIO and the AFL head, and perhaps the Secretary of Labor, and then three others. I'd like to see nine men of this stature called in by the president and told this. We believe in collective bargaining. You believe in collective bargaining. It has broken down in this particular case. Now, you men, not your deputies, but you men, get into this situation and see if you can't work it out through mediation. If you can't, then report to me and to the country what you think ought to be done about it. Maybe it's compulsory arbitration. Maybe it's an injunction. Maybe it's seizure. Maybe it's fact-finding with recommendations. I'm pretty confident that those nine men could, with the power at their command, the understanding which they have, work out these two or three cases which we have each year. How does your solution differ from Wirtz's, Doggerty? I think there's a great deal of merit in what Mr. Wirtz has suggested, because one difficulty about fact-finding is that if the parties know that it's going to be there, they are rather likely to have resort to it the same as to compulsory arbitration, whereas no one, as I understand your proposition, would know what these men are going to recommend. That's great. May I add one detail, which is that there would be an executive order requiring the preservation of the status quo during this period. Not an injunction, but an executive order that men stay at work and that the companies keep on producing. You're afraid of laws like this, aren't you, Cade? Yes, I am, because the implication of what both Doggerty and Wirtz have said is that government will be in every major labor dispute. I say that if the power of business is curbed by antitrust laws, and it is, and the power of labor is curbed by a similar law, which it is not, then you have no need to bring government in, nor do you need fact-finders. You break the thing down into little units, and with that, I agree with Wirtz. I think bigness is bare. I should like to make it quite clear that my recommendation in behalf of fact-finding with power to make recommendations under a statute or Mr. Wirtz's recommendation proposal both involve no ultimate acceptance of the recommendations by the parties and thereby, ultimately, as we showed in the steel strike, preserve freedom of action, which is a lot different from compulsory arbitration. Well, in spite of our analysis, the labor dispute is still with us. We seem to agree on that point. We seem to disagree, however, on how to handle it. We've heard the case for the fact-finding board. We've heard a sharp criticism of this method of approaching the industrial dispute. We've heard the case for little or no government action. May our discussion be a small part of a continuing successful search for better methods of keeping peace on the labor management front. Thank you, gentlemen.
