The radio's microphones are now in the council chamber in City Hall, and the occasion is the oath-taking ceremony of the Honorable Rudolph Halley, President-elect of the City Council of New York City. They have just made their entrance into the council chamber, and in just a few moments you'll hear the voice of Mr. David L. Schivitz, who will preside and present the regular Ottawa program. Mr. Schivitz. Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous flight, O'er the ramparts we watch were so gallantly streaming, and the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? Please remain standing while the invocation is offered by the Right Reverend Charles F. Boynton, Suffragan Bishop of New York. O God, the fountain of all wisdom, whose statutes are good and gracious, and whose law is truth, we beseech thee so to guide and bless this thy servant, Rudolph, here to be sworn into the weighty office of President of the City Council of the City of New York, that he may be the Lord, and may obtain and ordained for our governance only such things as are right and pleasing to thee and to the glory of thy name and the welfare of the people of this city. Grant unto him, O Lord, the spirit of counsel and ghostly strength, the spirit of knowledge and ghostly strength, the spirit of knowledge and true godliness, that he may discern the truth and impartially administer the law in the fear of thee alone. In the time of prosperity, fill his heart with thankfulness, and in the day of trouble, suffer not his trust in thee to fail. All of which we ask of thee, O Father Almighty, world without end. Amen.

you Thank you Thank you Thank you Everybody in the council chamber rises to salute Mrs. LaGuardia who is about to make a presentation This gavel of Fiorello's is significant because he used it for so many years It was given to him at the dedication of the municipal airport now called LaGuardia Field And he was so proud of that achievement that this is the one he used not only as mayor But when he also presided as director general of UNRWA at their sessions In giving you this gavel today Rudy, it just shows our confidence in you We are many here today who have been striving and working to bring back good government to the city of New York And we feel that you now are going to carry on for us And I'm very happy to use this as a symbol Mrs. LaGuardia is now presenting personally the gavel to Mr. Rudolph Halle The Honorable Rudolph Halle who has just been sworn in as president of the City Council of New York Thank you, Marie I regard this gavel as a symbol of dedication to public office Of complete integrity in public office And of decent, honest, and efficient public administration by a fearless man In holding this gavel, Marie, I will feel that I am holding the hopes and the aspirations Of many millions of people And certainly my own hopes and aspirations On this occasion I would like to say That having by the people of New York City And with the blessing and the aid of the Lord Undertaken the responsibilities of the office of president of the City Council It is appropriate that I publicly state my concept of the responsibility which I am accepting And my concept of the dedication which I am making I believe that we, people of New York City, have given me A mandate, a job to do A job which I must do And must do With all of my ability And never shrinking from it A job which has definite confines and limitations And to which I should limit myself So that I can give all of my energies and activities To the task at hand I believe that mandate Is to use every effort Within the legal, constitutional powers of my office In cooperation with my colleagues in office To bring about clean, decent, efficient municipal government I believe that that means That I cannot please all of the people all of the time It believes that I will have to have the courage To do that which is, in my opinion, right After I have sought and carefully weighed expert advice And received the help of the many people Upon whom I know I can count And on whom I should say I know we, the people, can count For aid and assistance in this job My election came after I had made a number of statements as to policy Of these I will not be unmindful They will always be in the forefront In every activity And I shall construe this mandate to mean That I shall engage in activity As the independent who has been elected Turning neither to one side nor to the other But serving all of the people Faithfully throughout my term of office And I thank those in this room Each and every one of you On behalf of all of the people Of the city of New York Thank you Dr. Israel Goldstein Rabbi of congregation B'nai Jeshrin Will pronounce the benediction In the spirit of self-dedication To the high purposes With which these ceremonies are invested We turn our hearts to the source Of all inspiration Thy spirit, O God Implanted in man Doth move him to do justice To love mercy And to walk humbly with thee Thy prophets Have taught us That the measure of man's merit In thy sight Is the extent of his concern With the well-being of his fellow men Millions of thy creatures Inhabit this huge and multi-complexioned Metropolis May our chosen leaders Keep their minds and hearts At tuned To the needs of the masses of the people May they not hesitate to vent Their cleansing wrath upon iniquity May they bend their compassion To the weak and the underprivileged May they devote their talents May they devote their talents May they devote their talents To the improvement Of our city's manifold services To all its citizens Upon him who this day Assumes high office And office to which he was elected By the people We ask thy special blessing May his vision Of a community cleansed of its dross Be matched by zeal of performance May he be granted Health and strength To endure the strain of public office May he be granted Health and strength To endure the strain of public office May he be granted To endure the strain of public office To endure the strain of public office Patience to cope with the obstacles which may obstruct his path Skill to overcome them And wisdom and
