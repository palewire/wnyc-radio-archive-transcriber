We're talking to you from 38th Street and Broadway, where a short time ago, a minor water main break occurred. Here in this spot, some four blocks south of Times Square, and almost in the shadow of the Metropolitan Opera House, a minor water main break caused a steam line to also break. The result is a tremendous display of steam erupting from several points in the pavement. Almost immediately, all representatives of various city departments reported to the scene. The situation is very, very much under control. Commissioner, acting commissioner of the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity, McCaffrey, were arrived almost immediately, as did the police coordinator, acting chief inspector John Schmidt. The fire department was represented by Chief Murtaugh. There are some 16 to 20 pieces of mobile equipment on the scene. And, of course, WNYC was prepared to bring any special word to you, should the occasion have arisen. The traffic has been diverted. The streets from 39th Street to 6th Avenue, from 7th Avenue to 37th Street, have been very efficiently closed off. The police have established the necessary cordon, and the crowds back of the police barriers are observing the tremendous clouds of steam which are coming up from the openings. As a matter of fact, the openings have prevented the possibility of anything serious like a minor explosion taking place. There is very little else to report from this point, so we return you now to our studios. Thank you.
