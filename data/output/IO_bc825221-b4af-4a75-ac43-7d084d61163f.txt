I am down here at the dispatch office of the Whitehall Street Terminal working out the final schedules and I can say officially that normal six boat ferry service will be resumed at 3.30 p.m. today, August the 13th. I would like to take this opportunity to express particular appreciation to the people of Staten Island for their forbearance, understanding and cooperation during the rush hours this morning when unauthorized absenteeism reduced the ferry schedule to two boats during the rush hours. Through teamwork and direct supervision, we were able to get all commuters New York bound by 9.45 a.m., which in view of the situation that confronted us was a fine tribute to Captain William M. McGuire, the director of our ferry service and his experienced operational staff. I had been down at St. George with Deputy Commissioner Alexander Pete Chopin since 5 o'clock this morning. We got things and ordered down there to the extent we were able and then conferred with the union leadership at my office at 11 a.m. I personally and directly and urgently requested that the union leadership direct all men to return to work immediately.

And an appreciation of the conscientious aid and assistance which we in the department have given the union and their negotiations for a new labor contract. They responded and directed all those who remained from their post during the rush hours this morning to return to work immediately. I really believe I did not want to start this night.esenri is the hour of the division of the crew of the compass and the policemen worshiped the Englishis area beforeimentoит term. I felt the detailed walk when the war occurs, which is 20 minutes later, I said hi, he was gonna be a fleeing horse down because, I gave him an negotiation. I'll be doing a real world Larsen but was fullyслary,
