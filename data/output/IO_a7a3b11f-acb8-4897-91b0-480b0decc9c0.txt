Good morning, everybody. Good morning, bombers and poppers. And good morning, girls and boys. And how is everybody this morning? Everybody's feeling very good this morning? Well, I'm very glad to hear it. Say, say, this morning, everybody's here in the studio. Everybody is here this morning in the studio. Mm-hmm. Let me introduce them all to you. Mr. Traffic Safety Policeman, good morning. Good morning, Mr. Narrator. Good morning. Good morning. And you say good morning to the boys and girls when you do that. Oh, yes. I forgot. Good morning, boys and girls. That's very good. Mr. Singer Safety Policeman, will you say good morning to the boys and girls? Good morning, boys and girls. That's very good. Oh, hey, this is Tommy over here. Say, Tommy, come on up to the microphone here. And you say good morning to the boys and girls. Go ahead, Tom. Oh, hello, Mr. Narrator. Oh, good morning, boys and girls. Mm-hmm. Oh, say, we mustn't forget our friend over here. Our friend, Mr. Piano. He'll be insulted. Say good morning, Mr. Piano, will you please? That's very good. Mr. Piano, say good morning. Oh, say, this morning, you know what we're going to do this morning? This morning, we're going to have a lot of fun. I have an excellent idea. Oh, yes? What is it, Mr. Narrator? I have an excellent idea. How would you like to make a safety song? A safety song? Mm-hmm. It's very easy. You know, I was speaking to Mr. Piano just a little while ago, and he had an excellent suggestion. He had a suggestion that we make a safety song. Now, Mr. Piano has an idea. He has some kind of a song over there that he wants us to make a safety song out of. Piano has a song? Mr. Piano has a song for us. Let's hear it, then. Yeah, Mr. Piano, would you please do us a favor and play that song that you played for us before? I don't know what the name of it is. Let me see. Would you play it for us? Please. Is that all there is to it? Oh, I see. That sounds familiar. Doesn't it sound familiar? I remember that, but I can't think of the name of it. I wonder what the name of it is. Oh, say, that's the, uh, that's the Farmer in the Dell. Remember that? Oh, now I already remember. Let me see how that was. The Farmer in the Dell. The Farmer in the Dell. I own the Cherrio. The Farmer in the... Oh, say, the boys and girls play that on the street. And that is your suggestion, Mr. Piano? Oh, that's the suggestion. Well, what do you think he wants us to do with it? How about it? Well, I don't know. He wants us to make a safety song about... Safety song? Now, yes, I don't know now. Uh, I, I, I... It's a, it's a wonderful start, but I wonder how we can start that thing. Let's see if we can get a... Oh, say, say, say, Mr. Narrator. Yes. Uh, uh, would this be a good idea for a safety poem? What is it, Tommy? Well, something about children at play. Children at play. That's very good. Now, the Farmer in the Dell, that's a game. And, and the children like to play it. So, suppose we start that off. That's a very good... Now, we have the first line. Tommy just gave us the first line of the poem. Well, what is it? What do you mean he gave it? Well, he just said, For children who like to play. They'll make that the first line. Oh, that's very good. Yeah, that's a nice idea. Do you think that... Well, uh, uh, now that I think, For children who like to play... Well, now, how would this fit in? This is what we say. Let's put those two lines together now. For children who like to play, This is what we say. Now, what is the most important thing that you could say to children who are playing? Let me, let me think now. Let me... Oh, yes, Mr. Narrator. I think I have it. Yes. Uh, think and act in a careful way. Yes. Mm-hmm. That's all right. Yes, and then you can say, And then you'll be safe all day. Very good. Wonderful, Tommy. Oh, that was very good, Tommy. Now, let's see if you put them all together. Let's see. For children... Each one will take their own line. Each one will take their own line, the one that you created. I'll take the first line, like I... For children who like to play. This is what we say. Think and act in a careful way. And you'll be safe all day. That's very, very good. I didn't know you could sing, Tommy. Tommy sings very well. Say, that's very good. Now, let me, that's for children who like to play. Say, Mr. Narrator. Yes. Can't we say something about crossing the street? You know, children crossing the street, that's very important, you know. I think you just said the first line again for our second stanza. I did? Yes, you did. Mr. Traffic Safety Policeman said something about crossing the street. So, let me put... Let me see now. Da-da-da-da-da-da. All right, here's the first line. Before you cross the street. How is that for a first line? Very, very good. All right. Well, now, let's see. To go on. Well, now, what would you say would be... Well, what would a smart boy or girl do before they cross the street? Now, what would you say they do? Yes, Tommy. Maybe Tommy can tell us. Yes, I was thinking, well, they should use their eyes before their feet. Oh, yes, I'd like to add to that. And then I think this would be another very good line. Then you'll be sure to always meet with safety on the street. You think that would fit? Try that, Mr. Melody. Will you repeat that line again, please, Mr. Traffic Safety, please? Then you'll be sure to always meet Yes. with safety on the street. That's a very good line. Now, let's each one take their line that they did before and we'll do the same thing with the second stanza. Mr. Piano, will you please give us the chord? Before you cross the street. Use your eyes before your feet. Then you'll be sure to always meet with safety on the street. Say, Mr. Singh and Safety Policeman, I want to warn you right now, I hope that you're mocking these words down because we're going to ask you to sing this new safety song that we're creating here this morning. It's great fun, isn't it? A lot of fun, isn't it? I'm getting all the words down. Don't worry about me. You're marking all the words down? Yep. Say, listen, you spoke about crossing the street. You know who we forgot? Who? Who? We forgot a very important person on the street. Oh, who did we forget? Who is that? Who is that? I'll tell you. Who? The silent policeman. We forgot the silent policeman. The silent policeman? That's right, we did. I don't understand. What do you mean? A policeman who doesn't talk? Oh, it's not bad. Oh, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Mr. Narrator is talking about the traffic light. That's true. Oh, I can see that now. Yes, the silent policeman, you know, he has two eyes. He has two eyes of safety. The silent policeman has one red eye. The silent policeman has one green eye. And the silent policeman's red eye, that tells us to stop. And the silent policeman's green eye tells us to go. So if he uses his eyes, everybody must use their eyes. Isn't that true, Tommy? Yes, I can see that now. That'll make for careful streets if we all watch for the red eye and the green eye and do what they tell us. See that? Tommy just gave me the first line again. You know, Tommy is getting smarter every week. He is. He is. He's helping us very much. Tommy just gave us the first line. And here's the way the first line is going to go. When the light is red, stop and use your head. How do you like that, Mr. Traffic Safety? I think if everybody did that, Mr. Narrator, our streets would be much safer. It would be. Our streets would be a whole lot safer for everybody. Now, we have to think of some more now. I think I have an idea for the next line. You have an idea for the next line? Let me repeat my line first and maybe see. But when the light is red, stop and use your head. Think and look as we have said. And for you, no hospital bed. That's very, very good. That's very good. Now, let's put that all together and we'll sing that and we'll sing those lines. Let me see. Mr. Piano, will you help us, please, again? When the light is red, stop and use your head. Think and look as we have said. And for you, no hospital bed. That's very good. Very good. Now, we're going to have Mr. Singh and Safety Policeman sing the whole thing. Let me see how smart he is. I hope he remembers the words. I hope he does. And if he makes one mistake, you know what we'll do? We won't put any mustard on his vanilla ice cream. That's a good idea. All right, let's go down here. Now, listen, don't be too hard on me. If I miss him, make a mistake, I'll try it again. All right, here we go. For children who like to play, this is what we say. Think and act in a careful way, and you'll be safe all day. Very good. Before you cross the street, use your eyes before your feet. Then you'll be sure to always meet with safety on the street. When the light is red, stop and use your head. Think and look as we have said. And for you, no hospital bed. Say, that was great fun. That was great fun. Making up a traffic safety song. Did I make any mistakes? No, no, no, no. Now, the thing to do is to remember those words. Oh, I do that. Yes. Everybody should remember those words because they're very important for everybody. Oh, say, it's great fun making up safety songs like this. Perhaps you could do something like this, huh? Perhaps you could make up songs. Look at them. We had Mr. Traffic Safety Policeman. He helped us with some ideas this morning. And we had Mr. Singing Safety Policeman. He helped us with some ideas this morning. And Mr. Piano helped us with some ideas. And you know who... Don't forget Tommy, you know. Oh, I nearly forgot Tommy. He gave us some excellent ideas this morning. It just goes to show you how smart Tommy is. Well, do you know something else, Mr. Narita? No, Mr. Traffic Safety Policeman. I think it would be nice that the boys and girls who are listening to us, if they would write in little poems, send them to us. And we could make safety songs or safety poems out of them. And we'll read them over the air? Read them over the air. Oh, that would be wonderful fun. Let's see who's going to be the first one to do it. And we'll do it over the air. And you mark down your school. And we'll tell what school you go to. Very, very good. Oh, say, by the way, I see that old clock is going around. And you know the clock doesn't have rubber hands. Oh, Mr. Narita, don't forget the ritual, please. Oh, yes. Remember our ritual? And remember our secret? Mr. Piano is playing. Everybody think. Everybody think for your safety. First corner. Then look. Traffic light. Then look. Green. Then look. Left. Then look. Right. And, of course, remember, playtime can be safe time if you will always think. But, of course, remember this, will you? Walk safely. Remember what's said. Don't cross streets while lights are still red. Cross at the corner. Don't run in the street. Because that's where trouble and accidents meet. Walk safely. You look left and right. The roadway is no place to play. Be cautious in bad weather. Be glad we're safe together as you walk safely each day. You know, perhaps we'll try making a new safety song next week. Perhaps some boy or girl will write it in. This is great fun. Oh, we're going to have a lot of fun with this here. Yes. And everybody help this morning. You know, it's so easy to make a safety song. And will you listen in next week at this time to this safety program that's sent to you through the cooperation of His Honor, the mayor, and the police commissioner in the interest of highway safety? Remember that. It is all your fun. Mr. Traffic Safety Policeman, Mr. Singing Safety Policeman, and Tommy, and your friend Mr. Narrator, we'll be here again next week. We'll try another safety song. We'll have a lot of fun. You want to try it with us? Until then, everybody be careful and remember to walk safely, remember what's said. Don't cross streets while lights are still red. Cross at the corner, don't run in the street. Because that's where trouble and accidents meet. This is the Municipal Broadcasting System.
