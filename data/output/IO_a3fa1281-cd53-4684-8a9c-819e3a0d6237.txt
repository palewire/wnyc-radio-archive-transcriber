The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Though it breaks my heart to go Something tells me I am needed At the front to fight the foe See those soldier boys are marching And I can no longer stay With werel fast on their heart I hear the bugle calling Goodbye Darth Vader God Something tells me I am near at the front to fight the foe. Leave us, soldier boys, on marching, and I can no longer stay. I hear the beautiful calling, goodbye, darling, pray. Come on now, sound, way, way down south, where the sun shines every day. Soft skies of blue shine down anew, and all the birds are singing clear and clear and gay. Come on, come on along, come on, join in the song. Jump on, follow this, it won't be long. We're on our way, it's pit for rain. We're going down south, hooray. And some snakes go home... Oh, thunder. Fels and snakes, the heart, oh, thunder. That is why I long for you. Lonely through the nights I've hung up. Wandering, darling, is your true? Distant lonely lands and shuns, Though the ocean waves divide, Absence makes the heart grow thunder, Longing to be near you, Be near your heart. Be near your heart. She was happy till she met you, And the fault is all your own. If she wishes to forget you, You will please leave her alone. She has come to her old mother, Just because there is no other, She'll be happy till her own sweet home. When the harvest days are over, Yes, we do. Christ, we do. And the sun gets flowers, No, he dies so free. He dies so free. You will see the word you said, That's the time we do shall wear, When the harvest days are over, Just be near, My just be near. You will see the word you said, That's the time we do shall wear, The time we do shall wear, Adore as the band played on But his brain was so loaded It nearly exploded The poor girl would shake me along He marries the girl with the ball-earing ground As the band played on Sweet Adeline My Adeline At night, dear heart For you I find In all my dreams In all my dreams Your fair-faced be Your fair-faced be You're the flower of my heart Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline Sweet Adjek Sweet Adeline Sweet Adeline He's only a man in a fearless day A beautiful sight to fear You may think he's happy and free from care He's not the most he seems to be He's not when you think of a wasted life For you cannot make me wait And her beauty was sold For an old man's gold She's a bird in a given day A little brown car A shady green spark So happy home I find My heart's barely gone I love only one She's the girl I have to be mine Just one girl Only just one girl Where are all the kind of But they're not my friend I'll be happy forever With just one girl I'll be happy forever With just one girl ETLON The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End A girl in blue, lad, who won your father's call. Became your mother, I married the other, but we have ripped her apart. She was bred in old Kentucky, where the meadow grass is blue. There's the sunshine of the country in her face and manner, too. She was bred in old Kentucky, take her boy, you're mighty lucky. When you marry a girl, I do. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. Sharing each other's sorrows, sharing each other's joy. Come, rat, come, rat, ever since we were born. They blew, oh, dear, I'd be kind. When they just read us, my darling, no comrade was there by my side. There's a name that's never spoken And a mother's heart have broken There is just another missing From the old home that is all There is still a memory living There's a father unforgiving And a picture that is true From the old home She's my sweet heart I'm her moat She's my Annie I'm her joe Good real valley Never up to far The river I need to be Is my sweet heart One evening in the month of May I met old Satan on the way I looked old Satan in the eye If you want to get to heaven when you die If you want to get to heaven in the good old way Gunny get your gun, get your guns Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on Rolling on The End The End The End The End The End The End The End Where did you get that hat?
