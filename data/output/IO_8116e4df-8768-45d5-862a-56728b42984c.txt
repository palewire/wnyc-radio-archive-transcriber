This is Kirk Douglas. We all remember the time, not too many years ago, when cerebral palsy was an individual problem. For the family of the person affected, it was a source of shame. For those looking on, it was a source of pity. But now it's no longer an individual problem. It's everybody's problem, because anybody can become affected by it. Every 53 minutes, another baby is born palsied, adding $10,000 every year to the tragic toll of those so pitifully handicapped. What can you do about it? You can support with all your heart the United Cerebral Palsy Association. Every dollar you contribute will help some small child overcome its crippling.

You know, all of us can be pretty cruel sometimes, because we just don't understand. Like with cerebral palsy. For years, those who were suffering from it were hidden away or avoided.

It could happen to you, or to me, tomorrow. The more than 500,000 who are now struggling with this handicap don't want or need our pity. They do want and need our help.

That one triumphant footstep, without a crutch, means that she is on her way to overcoming a heartbreaking handicap, cerebral palsy.

When a person is known as a comedian, it's sometimes difficult to talk about something serious. But I want to talk to you about something very serious indeed. Cerebral palsy. It's very serious that 10,000 babies are born with this dreadful condition every year. That countless thousands are stricken as a result of a shock, or an accident, or a severe illness. But perhaps the most serious is that of the more than 500,000 sufferers, only four out of every hundred are getting any care at all. Because there just aren't the means to care for them. That is the most serious. Thousands of human beings suffering needlessly when they could be helped. So give them a chance. Send the most you can afford to United Cerebral Palsy, 50 West 57th Street, New York 19, New York. Give today to brighten their tomorrow. This is Celeste Holm. Remember your baby's first steps.

In less than an hour from now, another baby will be born suffering from this pitiful condition. And just what is this malady about which so little was known until recently? This malady that once was shrouded in secrecy and shame. What is it? It's simply an injury to the motor section of the brain. It's something that can happen to you or to your child as a result of shock, or an accident, or severe illness. Help them become useful, productive human beings they can become with your help. Give them a chance. Send your most generous contribution to United Cerebral Palsy, 50 West 57th Street, New York 19, New York. Give today to brighten their tomorrow. This is Joseph Cotton. Do you believe that time heals all wounds? That's not always true. To a child suffering from cerebral palsy, it takes money, a lot of money, to help him overcome its crippling. It takes money to train the skilled and gentle hands that manipulate his twisted little limbs. It takes money to build and equip the desperately needed treatment centers. It takes money to finance the research into this tragic and baffling affliction. Although cerebral palsy is one of the oldest conditions known to man, it is one of the least understood and one of the most expensive to treat. Send all that you possibly can to United Cerebral Palsy Fund, New York 19, New York. This is Ray Moland. This year, 10,000 cerebral palsied infants will be born into this world. Each year, the figures are the same. Each year, with the same consistent cruelty, 10,000 children start life with one of the most pitiful conditions known to man. It was only a very few years ago that anything was known about this baffling affliction. Before that time, those suffering from it were either hidden or pitied, and then given up as hopeless and helpless cripples. But now, because there is such a thing as United Cerebral Palsy Association, there is hope. And because there is you to support it, there is help. So please send those contributions to United Cerebral Palsy Fund, New York 19, New York. Give to help them help themselves. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
