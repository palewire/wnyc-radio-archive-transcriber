We'll sing our reminiscence there of Benny Haven Pole. To our kind old alma mater, our rock-bound island home. We'll cast back many upon regret, as for life's peace we roam. Until on our last battle's fierce, the light of heaven shall flow. We'll never fail to drink through birth. And Benny Haven Pole. Oh, Benny Haven Pole. Oh, Benny Haven Pole. We'll sing our grand Millicenters of Benny Haven Pole. May the Army be augmented, so more than we let's flow. May our country in the hour of me be ready for the fall.
