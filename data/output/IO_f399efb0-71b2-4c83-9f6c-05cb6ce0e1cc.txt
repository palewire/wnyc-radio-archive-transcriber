It is a singular honor, first of all, to welcome the chief executive of the city wherein Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was born. of America was born. The world will ever hold Genoa in lofty esteem as the mother of the great admiral. Secondly, this opportunity is a welcome one for me since it affords me the advantage of expressing in public my deepest gratitude to Mayor Pertuzio for his untiring kindness and cordial hospitality to me when I visited Genoa last fall. The mayor and the citizens of Genoa on that occasion made manifest their love for New York where so many of their kin have found happiness and success. Mayor Pertuzio, apart from his high qualifications as a distinguished gentleman, has an extraordinary personal history. He has on many occasions proved that he is a very brave man. His own career symbolizes Italy's struggle against all kinds of totalitarianism. In 1943, Mayor Pertuzio was shot while escaping the clutches of foreign secret police before he was finally rescued by the partisans. He had an outstanding record in the resistance movement in northern Italy. He risked his life many times in the cause of democratic principles. Following the liberation, our guest of honor was nominated by Rome to assist the prefect of Genoa. In 1946, he became a member of the city council of the city over which he now presides. In 1948, he was elected to the national parliament of his country, representing the Christian Democratic Party of Premier de Gasperi. He is an authority on letters concerning the merchant marine and has served on the Italian committee for the Marshall Plan. When he was elected mayor of Genoa last year, he defeated the communist incumbent who had held the post for four and a half years. This victory alone would have made our honored visitor a historic personage. The critical times through which his nation had come would have been tragic for the ideals of liberty and democracy if he and other courageous men like him had not given all their talents and strength of will to the common cause of democracy. For this great service, I, as mayor of New York, and on behalf of all our citizens, hail you, Mayor Pertuzio, as a valiant soldier of the democratic way of life. I salute you and the people of Genoa. May the cause for which you have labored so intensely be crowned with success. And when peace and freedom are restored to all the world, may your name, Mayor Pertuzio, be ever remembered for the great part you played in the salvation of your native land. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President. Your services for mankind. Thank you, Mr. President. Mayor Impelitari is pinning the Medal of Honor, the city's gold Medal of Honor, on Mayor Vittorio Pertuzio of Genoa, Italy now. He's rather tall, smartly dressed, handsome-looking man, accepting the congratulations of the mayor, and bowing and bowing and bowing and bowing and bowing and turning to the battery of news photographers that we have here on this bright day at City Hall Plaza. They're posing for more pictures now, shaking the hand of the mayor. Mayor Vittorio is about six feet two, I would say, weighing about 210 pounds. Now here again, Mr. Coleman. The mayor of Genoa. The mayor of Genoa. The mayor of Genoa. The mayor of Genoa. Thank you. Vice-presidente Presidente of New York, it is with profound commotion that I have listened to his words affectionate and cordiales regarding my modest person and regarding the noble city that I have here the honor to represent. There are facts and acts that are made by men and every act that man has a unique meaning, but there are facts that have a particular meaning. So when she, Hon. Impiniteri, is here in Europe and is here in my city, she has not only completed a visit of cordiality, she has also made a homage to the city of Cristoforo Colombo and this is what is sent to the recognition of the people so connected to the land of America. But she, Hon. Impiniteri, is here in Genova, ambassador of democracy, that is so expensive to men of the United States, but so expensive to the Italians, especially, for this, Hon. Impiniteri, we are grateful for her, because she is a testimony and document of the democracy that lives in the United States, for which every American citizen, independent of its origin and social class, she can be prepared, as she is prepared, as she has been prepared, to the city. So this, my visit, is not only a response, not only a visit of courtesia, Hon. Impiniteri. This visit is the salute of the city of Cristoforo Colombo, the most great city of the United States and his mayor, which has had such great success in Genova and Italy. This visit is the statement of a man who belongs to the new democratic democratic democratic and has contributed to the of this man and the Italian population to the great people of the United States, to the United States, which we are deeply grateful for. We know all the sacrifices that this people have made to rid ourselves of democratic democratic freedom when we have intervened so presently in the war and today with many sacrifices material and of men. So today we can say that the United States have taken in the world the patrocini of democracy and have operated intelligently to defend democracy in Europe and to defend it in all the world. And, onorevole Impeliteri, onorevole Sindaco di New York, it is with this faith that we work. Because the democratic democratic freedom are really extended to everyone and there is peace and work for everyone. It is not easy to do. For some time we are not aware of it. We must remember that the reconstruction of democracy in Italy is just when we were trapped in the war. The government has been betrayed. From the stands and�� in Catalina of show We have taken our history together. Wow! We waste these onodes of government resistance to theけи Assim and the city of Spot of one. We have worked, we have worked, we have worked, we have worked for the future. It is with these sentiments, on the other side, that I salute you and the city of New York. And I say that we are tenacious in the work of the democracy in our country. We are tenacious. And we have examples. We have examples, especially in Genova. The tenacious of Colombo in searching your own land is an example to all the genoveses. The reason, not credibly, contrasted by every man and the events of all, this man knew that this great land existed and looked at it desperately. He went to the mountains and the mountains and the mountains, and looked at it everywhere, and looked at it everywhere, and looked at it wherever he wanted to find it for everyone to join the Christian cross. And, well, it doesn't matter if he then found it, it doesn't matter if everyone of us doesn't find it, it needs to persist, and others will find the way, the way to find it, the way to find it, and to be free, in peace and in the work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Pavia will interpret the remarks of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts indeed, that the mayor of the mayor is a part of the mayor. Mr. Mayor, friends of New York, there are certain acts indeed, which have a significance in themselves, and there are acts and deeds which assume a very special significance. Your visit to general, Mr. Mayor, was one of those acts that have a special significance. You did not only visit the city of Columbus, but you came to our city as an ambassador of New York, and as an ambassador of the United States. You were greeted by all of us as our friend, and as a symbol of all you stand for, and of all what New York, and this great country of yours stands for. You represented in our hearts the symbol of the American friendship, which means so much to us, and we tried to express to you our feelings of thankfulness and of deep appreciation. You also came as a representative of democracy, with all its possibilities, with its tremendous opportunities. You came in a time when we had just recovered democracy through a tremendous struggle. We had great difficulties, but we have been working hard to do this tremendous job of reconstruction. We have great examples in our history. Among others, the example of the great men which you just honored with your inspired words. Columbus had faith. He believed that he would find his way to the Indians. Perhaps he didn't succeed at first. We may not succeed at first. But in the end, we shall succeed. We shall win. It is in this spirit that I wish to thank you all for your so warm and cordial welcome. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
