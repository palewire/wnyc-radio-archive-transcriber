And now from Gershwin's Porgy and Bess, Florence Martirosian leads the choristers of the Department of Welfare with Isabel de Borey, accompanist in I've Got Plenty of Nothing. I've got plenty of nothing, and love is plenty for me. I've got no car, I've got no mule, I've got no misery. The folks with their kids and their kids, down a lot on the door. Pray somebody's a-goin' to rob them, but without a-make-in-more. What for? What for? What for? I've got a lot on the door, that's the way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that'll pay to be. For the things that are tied, like the stars in the skies are all free. Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my song, the head is a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my song. I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got no sun, got no moon, and the people see. The folks with plenty of money, got to pray all the day. Keep the plenty, you don't have to worry, I keep the devil away. Away, away. I am a friend of hell, and it's time to rise. Never worry long, it's not well. Never want to strive to be gone, to be bad. What the hell are you glad I'm a boy? Oh, I've got plenty of nothing, and nothing's plenty for me. I've got my gals, got my gals, for heaven's a whole day long. Do you complain it? I've got my gals, got my gals, got my lord, got my lord. I've got my gals, got my lord. You've heard the choristers of the Department of Welfare sing, I've got plenty of nothing, from Gershwin's Forgy and Beth.
