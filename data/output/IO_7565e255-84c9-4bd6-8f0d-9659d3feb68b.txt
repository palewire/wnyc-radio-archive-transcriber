make a presentation This gavel of Fiorello's is significant because he used it for so many years It was given to him at the dedication of the municipal airport now called LaGuardia Field And he was so proud of that achievement that this is the one he used not only as mayor But when he also presided as director general of UNRWA at their sessions In giving you this gavel today Rudy, it just shows our confidence in you We are many here today who have been striving and working to bring back good government to the city of New York And we feel that you now are going to carry on for us And I'm very happy to use this as a symbol Mrs. LaGuardia is now presenting personally the gavel to Mr. Rudolph Halley The Honorable Rudolph Halley, who has just been sworn in as president of the City Council of

man In holding this gavel, Marie I will feel that I am holding the hopes and the aspirations Of many millions of people And certainly my own hopes and aspirations On this occasion I would like to say That having By the people of New York City And with the blessing and the aid of the Lord Undertaken the responsibilities of the office of president of the City Council It is appropriate that I publicly state my concept of the responsibility which I am accepting And my concept of the dedication which I am making I believe I believe That we People of New York City Have given me A mandate A job to do A job which I must do And must do With all of my ability And never shrinking from it A job which has definite confines and limitations And to which I should limit myself So that I can give all of my energies and activities To the task at hand I believe that mandate Is to use every effort Within the legal Constitutional powers of my office In cooperation with my colleagues in office To bring about Clean, decent, efficient municipal government I believe that that means That I cannot please all of the people all of the time It believes that I will have to have the courage To do that which is in my opinion Right After I have sought and carefully weighed Expert advice And received the help Of the many people Upon whom I know I can count And on whom I should say I know we the people can count For aid and assistance in this job My election Came after I had made a number of statements as to policy Of these I will not be unmindful They will always be in the forefront In every activity And I shall construe this mandate to mean That I shall engage In activity As the independent Who has been elected Turning neither to one side Nor to the other But serving All of the people
