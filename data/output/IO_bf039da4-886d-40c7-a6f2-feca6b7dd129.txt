Northwestern University, in cooperation with the Mutual Broadcasting System, presents the Reviewing Stand. Northwestern University is celebrating its centennial year, 100 years of service to the nation and the great Northwest. Today the Reviewing Stand asks, Are we winning the war of words? Our unrehearsed give-and-take discussion will present an appraisal of our international program of information and compare it with Russian propaganda methods. Now our moderator, James H. McBurney, Dean of the School of Speech Northwestern University, will introduce participants in today's transcribed discussion. Mr. McBurney. Our speakers today are Edward W. Barrett, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. Barrett, what does your post involve in the State Department? It involves general supervision of our entire U.S. Government International Information Program, which includes the Voice of America and a great many other things. It includes advising the Secretary of State on public relations problems here and abroad, and it includes certain work in connection with the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization, and finally a great many operations concerned with maintaining contact between the Department of State and the American people. We're also glad to welcome to this Northwestern University Reviewing Stand David Nickel, Foreign Correspondent of the Chicago Daily News. Nickel, what has been your contact with our information program? Well, I've spent a good deal of the time since the war in Central Europe, most of it in Germany and particularly in Berlin. Berlin is a focal point in this question of the story of America as against that of the Soviet Union. You've been able to see some of the results of this program that Barrett describes at first hand. Yes, and to talk with the people who come out of the Iron Curtain countries and tell us what happens there. Yes, I'd say Berlin is enormously important because it's an island behind the Iron Curtain, really. It's the only place that we can get in behind the Iron Curtain successfully, I think. Are you going back to Germany? Yes, I'll be going back in November. We have also on this reviewing stand broadcast, Professor Donnelly F. Feddersen, who's chairman of the Department of Radio and Television at Northwestern University, and member of a special committee advising the Voice of America. We've already had several references to the Voice of America. What is that program, Feddersen? Well, Barrett's probably better able to answer that than I am, but as I have seen it, it's a worldwide network, broadcasting in nearly 50 languages, over 75 transmitters throughout the world. It is financed by the United States government funds under the State Department, and it speaks for the United States government and the American people. Do those broadcasts emanate from this country? Many of them do. Most of them do, I should say, at this point, although there are moves afoot to regionalize the output and to carry some of the programming to local areas overseas. Now, in this country, we've heard a great deal recently about Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia. How are these programs related to the Voice of America? Well, Radio Free Europe is an enterprise of private citizens in the United States. It concentrates in captive countries behind the Iron Curtain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and so forth, and largely financed, as I said, through individual contributions. It differs chiefly in this respect that it can be a citizen station for the people of Czechoslovakia, for example. Czechs who have come out from behind the Iron Curtain can speak via those facilities to Czechs who are still behind the curtain, and, of course, Radio Free Europe has the freedom to allow people to speak back to their own people much more than the Voice of America, which is really an instrument of American policy. It's basically the Voice of America speaks as we Americans speaking to you Poles, whereas, basically, Radio Free Europe speaks as we Poles speaking to you Poles, or you fellow Poles. I'd like to emphasize, though, that the Radio Free Europe is a distinctly worthwhile enterprise and deserves the support of the people in this country. You see, the Russians are spending today something between one and two billion dollars a year on propaganda. The combined expenditures of the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and all other American information operations is only about one hundred million dollars. Therefore, you can see the need for putting all the resources we can into this battle. Well, that comparison suggests the need, but, Barrett, how important are words in winning a war? We're talking about the question, are we winning a war of words? Well, I would say that words, or ideas, if you will, are immensely important in winning the so-called Cold War, because if we don't convince people on both sides of the Iron Curtain of the justice and of the promise of our cause, and of the phoniness of the other man's cause, then we're likely to find ourselves in a real shooting war. Is this war of words or ideas essentially a battle between Russian and American propaganda, Nicol? Is that the way you view it? I wouldn't think so. It's primarily a struggle between two systems. The one system of complete totalitarian control, which is best exemplified, almost exclusively exemplified, at the present time by the Soviet Union. The other side of it is the free world, in which the United States is a major proponent at the present time, and I certainly hope will continue to be an example of what freedom can do. Barrett, isn't this, doesn't this really dramatize one of the problems which the Information Service has? As we speak, you say, for the American people, the Voice of America and other information services speak for the American people. Isn't it pretty easy to miss this point that Nicol has just made and to give the impression that we are speaking solely in terms of America's self-interest, rather than in terms of the purposes of free peoples and our identification with the common cause? Yes, Fetterson, I'm glad you brought that one up. That is the very reason why we shifted emphasis very markedly in this program in the last year and a half. We're not just trying to win friends for America. We're not just trying to win admirers. We're trying to win friends for the whole cause of freedom and justice, the whole free world cause. Accordingly, we're working increasingly with natives of other organizations and a great international campaign of truth. I talked with a Russian officer who came over to Western Germany not long ago, and I asked him some questions about Voice of America and its effectiveness, and his criticism at that time was that a man who is risking his life to listen to an outside radio is not much interested in hearing an interesting story, no doubt, but a story of American book publishing or a story of American household appliances. He said the one thing that is important is a hard-hitting message that will give people some hope, news, political comment, indication of what's going on in the free world in very short, concise form. Byrd, isn't that essentially what the Voice of America is doing? That's essentially what we're doing. We've stepped up the portion of our output that is hard, straight news to begin with, and the proportion that is commentary. We do still carry some material to Russia itself, not to most of the rest of the world, about the relative well-being of Americans, how many hours they have to work to get a pair of shoes, which is something like four hours, whereas a Russian has to work something like 45 hours, because we have found that story effective behind the Iron Curtain, and many other Russians who come out have told us that it is effective. Do you tell them about the number of bathtubs we have, and the number of automobiles we have, and so forth, and so forth? To Russia, yes. To underdeveloped areas in most other countries of the world, no. How would you sum up the tersely, the primary purposes of this information program? Well, I'd sum it up in four main categories. First is to expose a phony, vicious, and really reactionary nature of Communist imperialism. Second is to instill in free peoples everywhere a desire to cooperate with us, and this we can do by showing up the lies that the Communists are telling about us, and by demonstrating that we are a decent people whose moral strength and physical strength can be counted on. Third is to build behind the Iron Curtain every possible psychological obstacle to Kremlin aggression, and fourth is to build up on this side of the curtain among all free peoples, a new spirit of unity and spunk and determination, a spirit to resist aggression at whatever cost. Now in phrasing those four objectives, in each case you made reference to Russia. I take it then that we're directing our effort primarily against Russia, and against Russia's story and Russia's propaganda. We think the very critical situation that faces a world is a preservation of the free world from Russian aggression. Accordingly, we are putting maximum emphasis on that today. I would like to suggest at this point what seems to me a very important distinction we should always make. I think we feel that the peoples of Poland and Czechoslovakia and the various other countries within the Iron Curtain are our allies already. They know freedom, or they know what freedom is because they've lost it. And I think they probably know more effectively what freedom is than some of the areas which still have it. I do think we must always make clear that it is the government or the system under which these people are living which we oppose, and not the best interest of the people themselves. We are trying to help the people of Poland as much as we're trying to help the people of Germany or England or any place else. I'm glad you brought that up, Nicol, because a cardinal point in this entire program must be a distinction between the peoples and their communist governments. You noticed that in summing up those four points I used the word Kremlin instead of Russia or Russian for just that reason. Well now, is this story of ours getting across, Nicol? You've been in Europe, in a position to see what has happened there. Well, let me suggest this, that we haven't been in this business very long and that we're still experimenting with ways of getting the story across. I would say that the story isn't across yet. There is a very great deal that has to be done and improvements that have to be made constantly. I'd like to point out, Fettison spoke of the regionalization of the output. My own experience has been that the most effective operation we have in this war of ideas is the radio station which is operated in Berlin through the Office of the High Commissioner and the State Department there. The important thing in connection with this radio station which is called RIOS is that the work, the thinking is almost entirely done by Germans and that the American supervision is limited to four or five men. RIOS is not a Voice of America station. It is, as you pointed out, a station that's operated largely by Germans. But we own it? Oh yes, and it's integrated with the Voice of America program. The Voice of America carries some programs on it. A survey that I saw recently from your program evaluation bureau pointed out that, well, two things of major interest. First, that RIOS is one of the most popular stations, not just in our zone in Berlin, but in the whole eastern zone of Germany. And that, by long odds, it outstrips all competition. And secondly, that one of the Voice of America programs which it relays for you is, I think, the second most listened to program in that area. Yes, there's no question that RIOS has proved one of the most effective instruments we have. It's because of that experience that we are transferring some of our own Voice of America operations to points overseas, points nearer the Iron Curtain. For example, we are starting this month, I believe, broadcasting from Munich to Iron Curtain areas. Well, now, you said a minute ago, or suggested a minute ago, Nicol, that we have friends behind the Iron Curtain. Does that mean that this story we're telling via this German station you've been discussing, and our Voice of America programs, that that story is getting into the Iron Curtain countries? Well, I would say it this way, that the people are our friends because we stand for freedom which they don't enjoy at the present time. We stand for getting the Russians off their backs, where they are at the present time. And to these people, our story is a very simple one, just that, keep your hopes up that someday it's going to be better. Yes, a story that we are still with you. We haven't forgotten you. Keep up your spirit of resistance. Don't go in for active resistance now, but keep up your spirit of resistance. Of course, I think it's important here, too, to add this comment, that it is more important than the people of the United States. That it is much easier to reach those people with our story, because these people, by personal experience, know what communism means. We have quite a different problem, haven't we, Barrett, in certain other areas, where communism is an abstract idea, pretty much as democracy is an abstract idea, where you have two abstractions fighting for predominance. Yes, I think Nickel could tell you that the nearer people are to the Iron Curtain, by and large, the more hatred they have for the Kremlin system, the more fear they have for it. Certainly that's true. I think in Berlin, we have the feeling that the Berliners are our most effective allies in Germany, and that our second most effective allies are the Eastern Germans, who live in the Soviet zone, and that the people who are still questionable in their attitude towards us are the Western Germans in the areas that we occupy. But don't the Russians have a more exciting story to tell than we have? They couch their story, at least, in terms of freedom, in terms of breaking the shackles, in terms of revolution. Does that story get over in a way that ours doesn't better? Of course, you raise a very crucial point here. The difference between a negative approach to information and a positive approach to information is at stake, it seems to me. If our effort is solely confined to denying the Russian promises, I don't think we should get very far, which is one of the reasons that I was impressed recently when I heard, I think one of your people in the Voice tell about a program which had recently been developed called the Permanent Revolution, which, to my way of thinking, symbolizes a way of presenting the democratic idea in a positive and dynamic way that will appeal to a target audience who do not care to look forward to a future that is completely bereft of the hope of changing their situation and who might be easy game for a Russian promise of pie in the sky. Well, now, in what sense is the democratic hope identified with the Permanent Revolution? Simply in the sense that, well, as Barrett has pointed out here, the Kremlin story is essentially a reactionary one in the sense that once the status quo is established, there it is. It's the status quo and it may be expected to stay that way. Whereas the democratic story, as exemplified by American history and the history in all democratic peoples, has been one of gradual evolution. The so-called permanent revolution is really the achieving the social ideas through peaceful means rather than by simply going in and throwing out the haves and putting in the have-nots. I think we should be careful in our discussion about revolution to point out that we are not at the moment preaching revolution in any sense to the peoples of Eastern Europe, to the people who live within this Russian area of control. I take it what you mean is that we are trying to point out to the people of Western Europe that they can achieve the things which communism promises but doesn't deliver. Yes, that we have at least an equivalent for social change and that our equivalent is really what we know as social evolution. Yes. An evolution which has been going on in this country with the consent of the government for lo these many years. Yes, I would say it's a great deal more than an equivalent for social change. As you were really implying, the progress that we've been making in this country and that other free countries have been making for the last 150 years or more, really much more, is the most revolutionary trend that this world has ever seen. It's a dynamic thing and that's a story we're trying to tell increasingly. Well, I should think it would be a matter of considerable importance that that story be told vitally and dynamically because you're directing your programs, as I understand it, to a good many people who haven't a great deal to look forward to as things are now. That's right. And in the degree that we get ourselves identified with the status quo in some of those countries, we might be telling a story of despair. Well, yes, I would agree with that. And, of course, at the same time, this is a campaign of truth that we are waging. We cannot match the Russian promises of pie in the sky and washing machines and refrigerators and still remain honest and credible. We can, however, say that freedom is the way that the individual can, in any country, is permitted the opportunity to work out his destiny under circumstances which at least permit him to change his status. And how it offers him the greatest hope over the long run. The greatest hope over the long run. For justice and for his own welfare. Exactly. I think at this point we should be quite sure that we're not identifying the best interests of everybody else with our own selfish interests as Americans. We must point out to them that the system under which America has achieved greatness is a system which offers French people, Frenchmen, an opportunity to achieve greatness as Frenchmen. Uh, Nicol, I'm glad you brought that up. One of the most encouraging things I've found since I've been working with the Voice of America is the rather highly developed program evaluation service which they have. Some of the researches which they are doing on communications habits in various countries and on the needs and interests of people in various areas which are, as you point out, quite rightly, are different from our own. Is providing our information service with an invaluable tool, wouldn't you say Barrett? For actually talking to people in terms of where they are going and where they want to go. That is correct. One of the most important things we're doing today is making groups and the countries concerned on this side of the Iron Curtain sit down and listen to the Voice of America and give us their criticisms and comments, fill out questionnaires. Uh, in the case of countries behind the Iron Curtain, we're, uh, taking persons who have recently escaped and forming them into panels. Getting them to sit down daily and listen to the voice and give us their criticisms and their suggestions. Now that begins to give us some, uh, of the, uh, facets of this program, where the program of information we're discussing, uh, Barrett. Uh, can you give us a, a broader picture of it? Uh, what methods and materials do we use? We've mentioned radio, of course. Well, Dean McBurney, I could speak for 45 minutes on that, but I imagine you'd prefer my 45-second version. Uh, we have radio which uses 75 transmitters, reaches about half the radio set owners behind the Iron Curtain. Two million people a day in France. A recent survey show brings in 33,000 letters a month and so on. We have films which reach an audience of approximately 400 million people a year. Uh, press publications, uh, pamphlets, posters that are put up by ourselves and by cooperating organizations abroad. Uh, they are the 100-odd information centers, which are in a sense serving as arsenal ideas, arsenals of ideas, I might say, for those who are fighting for the cause of freedom. We have the exchange of persons program, which, to my way of thinking, is one of the most important of all the programs. We find that about 97% of the leaders who are brought to this country, given a chance to see this country for themselves, the good along with the bad, somehow go back sold on our decency, our honesty, our determination to make progress, our physical and moral strength. I would like to point out, uh, simply that we must be very careful not to consider this information program as a thing in itself. Uh, there's been a very great increase in confidence in Europe in the last 12 months or so. Some of it, no doubt, is due to Voice of America or to the information programs. Uh, a good deal of it is also due to the arrival of General Eisenhower. Uh, a lot of it is due to the arrival of American divisions with full equipment. It gives people great heart to see this evidence that the free world is not only talking but building and getting ready. I'm very glad Mr. Nickel brought up that point, uh, because words alone are not worth a great deal in the so-called war of ideas. Actions alone, unless they're well publicized, are not worth a great deal. Eisenhower's arrival was a tremendous shot in the arm for Europe. It became much more of a shot in the arm when it was well publicized, when the true meaning of it was told, when the story of Ike Eisenhower as an individual, a humanitarian as well as a military leader, was told by films and radio, etc. When the communist efforts to smear him were rebutted by the simple quotations of the things that Stalin had said about Eisenhower five years ago. We raised the question, are we winning the war of words? I'd like to direct to you again the question, Nickel, in your judgment is this war of words that we've been describing here going over? Well, I'd say that we're making slow and very painful progress, but we are making progress. The opportunities or the spirit of the West is building steadily, not nearly as rapidly as we had hoped, but, uh, and with many delays and many heartbreaks along the road, but I think we are making progress. You think people are really listening to these broadcasts or reading these pamphlets or getting this story? It's much broader than that. It's that they, through these broadcasts and pamphlets and through the activities of many organizations in the country's concern, the story is getting across. But I'd like to agree with Nickel that it's not getting across as anything like as fast as I would like to see it. But we're absurd when, uh, Americans are absurd when they say we're losing the war of words. Let's remember that the Communists have put on the greatest propaganda effort the world has ever seen in their own satellite states and they've failed dismally at it. The vast majority of the people in the satellites are with us and not with the Kremlin today. The Communist Party has lost strength in every country in Western Europe during the last four years, although there was one little setback in Italy. And the spirit of resistance, the spunk and determination that Mr. Nickel mentioned is increasingly evident in Europe. I'd like to point out, too, while we're talking about the success of getting our story across in the various areas of the world, that, uh, our information service is, as you pointed out, a relatively new thing. And that, uh, our facilities for carrying on this kind of campaign are, uh, rather small compared to the facilities of the opposition. Uh, Russia has as many transmitters attempting to jam our broadcasts into Soviet Russia as the Voice of America has in all. We need, uh, the addition of, uh, a ring of facilities around the world in order to be able to get the broadcast message to the target audiences. There are still some areas that we do not reach with the kind of signal that we would like to get in. Are you suggesting that, uh, that the Communists have more facilities in this area or giving more to it than, than we give? Oh, very, very definitely. That is the reason that we're going back to Congress in the very near future, I hope, and ask for the sort of facility, the funds for the sort of facilities that Mr. Fetterton has mentioned. How do the, how do the Russians try to combat our, uh, program of information? Well, they put on, to begin with, they shut out virtually all publications and similar materials from the entire Iron Curtain area. They make it very dangerous to listen to the free world radios. And finally, they put on the most massive effort to jam us out that the world has ever seen. They're using... Well, how do you jam out, uh, program? You put another transmitter on a program that's just making, on the same wavelength, would allow to say a Voice of America transmitter, that just makes squeaky noises or clacking noises in order to prevent the Voice of America program from being heard. We are now facing approximately 1,200 Soviet jammers. Now that's important, and that's one reason we're asking for these increasing, these increased facilities. We find from a survey made by a lot of top scientists in this country, that it costs the Russians approximately 5 to 1 in terms of dollars and in terms of manpower.
