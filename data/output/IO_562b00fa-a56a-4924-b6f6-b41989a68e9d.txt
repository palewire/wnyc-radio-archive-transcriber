Because of the pressure of City Hall Business, Mayor O'Dwyer will not be able to read his proclamation declaiming this week, December 2nd through December 9th, Shelter Homes for Children Week. In his stead, Comptroller Lazarus Joseph has kindly consented to substitute for him. And so from Mayor O'Dwyer's desk in City Hall, we present the Comptroller of the City of New York, the Honorable Lazarus Joseph. Whereas we in the City of New York are called upon to be good neighbors by helping to care for those children who are temporarily deprived of their own homes, whereas there are in Greater New York each day children of all races and creeds who are temporarily homeless because illness or other misfortune deprives them of their own family life, whereas in the past these children have been cared for in institutional shelters which are now filled to capacity, whereas many well babies have been placed in hospitals because there were no temporary homes for them, whereas the Mayor's Committee on Child Care has recommended that shelter homes for children are urgently needed, whereas in order to meet this critical situation, the Department of Welfare, in cooperation with the voluntary child-caring agencies representing the Catholic, Jewish, and Protestant faiths, is undertaking an unprecedented campaign to find families who will share their homes with these children, whereas the people of the City of New York have always responded readily to any appeal to be a good neighbor on behalf of children. Therefore I, William O'Dwyer, Mayor of the City of New York, to hereby proclaim the week beginning Monday, December 2nd, 1946, to be shelter homes for children week and call upon families in the City of New York to share their homes with these children. Now I'd like to explain just what this is all about. Beginning today and for a two-week period, a house-to-house canvas will be made in certain residential areas throughout the City by representatives of the Department of Welfare. They may not get to see you, but if you are interested, will you take it upon yourselves to contact Shelter Homes Campaign, Lehigh 41520 at 325 East 103rd Street. Beginning the week of December 16th, 1946, visits will be made to families who expressed an interest in acting as a good neighbor in opening their homes to these children or who want further information as to the requirements for having their homes certified as shelter homes. Who are these children who need your care? They are children of all races and creeds whose own homes are temporarily disrupted due to illness or misfortune of their parents. They are children who need understanding and kindness during a period when all their security has been taken away from them. They are children who need the care and attention which their parents are temporarily unable to give. Again I ask, who are these children? But for the grace of God, they might be yours. They might be the youngsters you see every day around you. The Freds, the Marys and the Davids. They are the quiet and the shy children. The noisy and the boisterous ones. They may be frightened or upset at the tragic circumstances precipitating their sudden removal from their own homes. They may be children of any age from infancy up to 16 years. Many of them are babies. And when I tell you that many of these babies, well babies, are at this moment lying in hospital wards for want of a home, I am sure you will long to take them into your own home so that they can get not only good physical care but the mothering and love that is every baby's right. May I tell you about Adele, age 9, Fred, age 5, Mary, age 4, Bertram, age 3, and Timothy, age 1, who could not understand it when their father left home. Their mother too brooded and became very unhappy. The doctor finally said that the mother would have to take a rest if she wanted to avoid a serious nervous breakdown. These children do not understand what is happening. When their mother goes away, they will be happier that they can be together in a family where there is a kindly mother person until their own mother is well again. In another situation, Commissioner Radigan tells me that the visiting nurse asked that we place David in a shelter home. On her visit to the family, she found the mother seriously ill but refusing to go to the hospital because there was no one to care for David, who is six weeks old. If only some kind woman would look after him for me until I am well enough to look after him myself, she said. Here is Tommy, for instance, who was born while his father was overseas. He is only two years old, but he still does not know his father, who on return from the army was sent to a hospital in upstate New York. Tommy's mother has struggled very hard to keep Tommy well and happy. But the other night, she was rushed to the hospital at the doctor's for advice for an emergency operation. The neighbor who cared for Tommy overnight cannot keep him any longer. Then let me tell you about the Brown children. When Mr. and Mrs. Brown came to New York and were lucky enough to find an apartment, they thought they were well able to take care for their six children, ranging from little Danny, age two, to Mary Ellen, age 12. But Mrs. Brown began to have serious attacks of asthma. The doctor recommended that she rest in a convalescent home for six weeks. There are no relatives who can help the family. The father works at night. Mary Ellen is too young to be at home alone with the children at night. Even if a housekeeper could be provided during the day. These children want a home. They would like to be together. But if they must be separated, Mary Ellen says to let her go with Danny, because the other four are old enough to take care of themselves. And finally there's Marvin, whose father is employed at night. He does not get home until 3 a.m. When Marvin's mother was taken to the hospital for an operation, Marvin, who was 13 years old, said he was old enough to manage. However, it isn't fair to leave him home alone at night, and the parents have asked the Department of Welfare to try to find a shelter home for him. These children, and many more, need a substitute home, which will provide a kindly, home-like atmosphere where the child will join in the family life, attend school and church in the community, and have as little disruption as possible to his daily living. Any family in good health, of good character and reputation, and the foster mothers not over 60 years of age would be able to help these children if they have available space. It is most important of all that the families have a happy home life and love children. We understand that this will mean added responsibility for you, and therefore a special board rates have been approved by me and the Board of Estimates to pay for the care of these children. The boarding parent whose home has been accepted as a shelter home will be paid $2 a day for each child in the home. In addition, clothing, medical care, and other authorized expenses will be met as needed by the child caring agencies of the three major religious faiths who are cooperating with the Department of Welfare in this project and who will stand by to assist the boarding mothers in every possible way and to supervise the child during the period of his stay in the shelter home. The need is great. Each day in New York City, many children must be cared for away from their own homes for temporary periods. Some for overnight only, some for a few days, and some for several months. We in this city have opened our doors and our hearts to people in trouble the world over. Right now, many of our own children are in trouble. I know the people of New York City will not fail them. Your priest, rabbi, or minister, join with me in beseeching your help.
