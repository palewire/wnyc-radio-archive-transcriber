Mr. Mayor, General Quittenberger, Admiral Badger, Commissioner Wallander, distinguished guests, and volunteers in civil defense. We have often heard it said that New York City is target number one. The planning and organization for its defense in case of attack are well advanced. These plans need an immense number of people to carry them out, which is the reason why a program of volunteer recruitment is now urgent. No inhabitant of this city can possibly be considered expendable if a bomb falls. We must get ready now. Today we are launching what we hope will be the first of several special drives to enroll volunteers for the various services needed by the Emergency Division of Civil Defense. This campaign for 291,900 volunteers for the Medical Emergency Division is spearheaded by a call for 41,460 nurses and 25,840 nurses' aides. Such an effort to be successful must be a cooperative one, and this is no exception. The Chairman of the Committee on Nursing Services for Civil Defense of the Community Nursing Division, Health Council of Greater New York, Mrs. Samuel L. Rosenberry, appealed to the Coordinator of Recruiting and General Information, Mr. Whelan, to arrange for the signing up of the nurses, nearly 18,000 of whom have already answered a questionnaire indicating their willingness to serve. Mr. Whelan then asked Mrs. Kelly and myself to work out a master plan. Mrs. Mary Ellen Manley, the head of the Nursing Services section of the Medical Emergency Division, indicated the 16 municipal and voluntary hospitals most suitable for registration and furthered the plans in innumerable ways. The United Hospital Fund, through their Women's Executive Committee, headed by Mrs. William Shippen Davis, undertook to recruit 600 volunteer interviewers to register volunteers in these hospitals. These interviewers have been specially trained for the task and are at work today, only two weeks after the call went out. All newspapers, radio stations and other media of information have been alerted and we hope will give enthusiastic cooperation, which they have already started to do. All five borough offices of recruitment and public information are helping to spread the news and carry out the plan. This meeting is therefore a pioneer project and now having explained the plan which brought it about, it is an honour and a pleasure for me to introduce the chairman of the meeting, the coordinator of recruiting and public information, the Honorable Grover A. Whelan. Mr. Whelan. Mr. Mayor, General Crittenberger, Admiral Badger, Mrs. Mrs. Dr. Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. Mrs. Davis, Dr. Kobler and the distinguished guests that are here and our Director of Civilian Defence, Arthur Wallander. It's a great privilege today to see the response that has been made to the call of volunteers. As a matter of fact, we all know that manpower has been the subject of discussion for a number of months in our federal, state, and city government. Manpower is a problem of the first order, particularly so when it relates to volunteers. It is. It's not a job that you do because you're paid for it, but it's a job that you do because you believe in the things that you're working for. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and our way of life. Those are the things that we believe in. That's the reason all of us are here this afternoon. There isn't any one of us that would give up this opportunity to be present here this afternoon, I'm sure, because the Medical Emergency Division is probably one of the first and most important parts of saving lives in civil defense. We have many other services, as you well know, but when you've got a toothache, you want to see a dentist very badly. And when you have a stomachache, you want to see a doctor very badly. And so it is with those of us who will be called upon to either suffer or to aid those that have been most unfortunate, that we play our part as a team. And that team are the people that are before me today, both the men and women, in the services not only of the city, but those of us who are outside the city services and are acting on behalf of our impulses and our feelings towards our family and towards our beloved city. We have this afternoon the men that are with us this afternoon, the men who are responsible for the 8 million people that will be target number one if it should ever happen. And I've asked them here this afternoon simply because I believe that you like to see and hear them, hear their sincerity and hear their belief in the fact that we shall be able to raise an army of 1 million volunteers. For what? For the protection of our homes, for the protection of ourselves, and for the preservation of the city of New York, and not only for the city of New York, but the state of New York and for our nation. Now, of course, the Civil Army of Volunteers needs a little help from the regular army. We expect the regular army to stop all the planes that might have New York as target number one on their, well, whatever they have it on. But anyway, that's the, and the commanding officer of this great area, and he not only has New York as an area, because after all, planes can come from New York and get to San Francisco, a jet plane two and a half hours, so that the general won't have very much time to do anything about it, unless he has planned and trained it carefully. And that's our big job today. And it's a great privilege for me to introduce as our first speaker, General Willis D. Krittenberger, Commanding General of the First Army. General Krittenberger. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mayor, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a distinct gratification to me to join you on this inspirational occasion opening the nurse recruitment week and to witness the great city of New York taking this very important step in preparing itself for a possible emergency. This mass meeting is another indication of the efforts of our civil defense authorities to press forward with the tasks that confront them. This civil defense program is a tremendous contribution to the national defense of the United States. Our government has defined civil defense as meaning the protection of the home front by civilians acting under civil authority to minimize casualties and war damage and to preserve maximum civilian support in the war effort. In recognition of this, the establishment of an adequate civilian defense organization is necessary in order to complete the national security structure of the United States. civil defense and military defense must go hand in hand in the protection of this country of ours. From a military point of view, civil defense makes our combat soldier a better fighter because it relieves him of undue concern for his loved ones at home and it assures him that he has maximum support from the home front. And that is a big thing. Although civil defense is the function and principal responsibility of civilians, we want the people of this city to know that the First Army stands squarely behind them and their entire civilian defense organization. We of the Army are here to furnish information, reference impending threats, to advise with you on your defenses, to consider matters of blackout, dim out, and camouflage, and to render all assistance in disaster, logistical and otherwise, upon the request of your proper civil authorities. To that end, each Army agency under my command has been directed to assist your civil defense agencies in every way possible to make the civil defense force an effective service and without delay. I am sure you all know that the Army encourages every citizen of this free country to volunteer his services, to assist in preparing his homeland to be capable of withstanding any emergency. We ourselves will be there when needed. Now, with reference to today's program and ceremony, at this opening of Nurse Recruitment Week, these several hundred nurses in uniform, to whom the mayor will soon administer the loyalty oath, are all symbols of New York's desire to be ready in event of any eventuality. They are the standard bearers of your determination to serve your city and your country. As is so well known by you all, the city of New York is the pride of every American. Each section of the country looks upon New York with admiration. Accordingly, in this nurse recruitment drive, you are now assuming a national leadership in civil defense, which today is so vital to our nation's welfare. The stimulation of this afternoon's rally will be felt not only in the metropolitan area, but may also start an echo that could well be heard throughout the land. And so, it is time for every individual to realize that he must now step forward and make his contribution to his home community and thereby to his country. If he will examine himself to discover what he can do, consulting the agencies of civil defense, he will find the right niche for his talents and his capabilities. It is indeed fortunate that the service we are stressing today is that of nursing. The women who are taking the loyalty oath later on have seen wherein their duty lies and have dedicated themselves to their city's services. Other young women seeing this dedication will say to themselves, if they can do it, so can I. This start is good. It is inspiring. It points the way for even greater efforts. We are reminded that in the nursing profession are found all the elements which typify woman at her best. here her native gentleness, kindness, and mercy blended with her training give her wisdom and strength to be the comfort of mankind, to be the one wanted when a fellow needs a friend. one. We all realize the profession of nursing needs no one to champion from a rostrum its accomplishments in battle and in emergency. Three hundred American nurses attending are wounded halfway around the world in the cold winter of Korea. Speak eloquently for themselves and the merciful organization that they represent. On the battlefield, sucker and first aid are rendered the wounded by a ministry of God, frontline doctors, and the ever-present nurse. Likewise, in the wake of a disaster of a major proportion, the injured or the destitute of a civilian community, look hopefully to those angels of mercy whose ministering hands bring relief. But we must understand that this humanitarian service for those unfortunate victims of shot and shell, bomb, or missile is not something that can be organized overnight. Unfortunately, we cannot wait until we are overtaken by disaster and then expect successfully to combat it and overcome its consequences. In that way, we cannot possibly hope to measure up to our responsibilities. Such delay in preparations could only result in unspeakable confusion, loss of lives, and possible panic. Let me illustrate. way. In World War II, it was possible to save the lives of 97 out of every 100 men wounded, an almost unbelievable record, not only because of the long experience and organization behind our Army Medical Service, but also because of the advanced preparations that were made for every phase of any projected operation. Here in the metropolitan area, the recognition of this need for advanced preparation has taken the form of this nurse recruitment week. The plans to provide the qualified nurses and personnel for this service that is so important a part of our whole civil defense structure are keeping pace with other projects of defense, I am told. But I am here today to emphasize, if I may, the necessity of following through on these initial efforts. This recruiting of nurses, volunteering for enrollment, so auspiciously started, promises very well. The success or failure of the entire project, however, may well depend upon the long hours devoted to continuing preparations from here on into the future. The time is past for anyone to be casual or passing of about civil defense. This is no moment, no hour, no day to hold back. the need is now. We all have a job to do. Finally, thank you for the privilege of joining you here today in this very commendable and highly essential civil defense activity, this recruitment of nurses. all of us, Mr. Mayor, are quite aware of its great significance. And to those of you of this first group of volunteer nurses for enrollment, assembled here today for your oath, the Army of the United States extends its sincerest congratulations. Thank you, General Crittenberger, for that inspiring speech. it's a great privilege for me to present to you Vice Admiral Oscar Badger of the Eastern Sea Frontier Command. Admiral Badger. Chairman, Mayor, things, guests. The Navy, in conjunction with our sister services, is engaged in a joint effort to prevent disaster from coming within the limits of the United States by any form of military attack by any potential enemy. That joint effort involves a great deal of joint planning, joint thought, and all the elements that make for success in military operations, whether they be offensive or defensive. Personally, I have a great deal of confidence in the ability of our services working together as they are now working and have been working for many years to prevent any disaster of importance coming through the military effort of our enemies. Nevertheless, in my recent experiences throughout the world, I have seen disaster visit people, and I've seen that disaster grow into unbelievable and unnecessary precautions, I mean unnecessary extent, because of the fact that they had not made preparations, not even to the planning stage, for minimizing the effect of the unexpected, whether it be by drought, whether it be by attack, or any other cause of unexpected disaster. general Krittenberger, in his very eloquent address, covered everything that any military person could hope to cover in an address on an occasion like this. One phrase, however, and only one that he left out of his talk, where he said the army of the United States, or the First Army, he didn't mention the words and the Navy and the Air Force, and every promise that he cares to make regarding his duties and his outlook toward this important matter of civil defense applies equally to the other services. I'm sure that that wasn't an omission. That was just to give me the opportunity to add a few words to the gist of his talk. I would like to emphasize one thing, though, that has been impressed on me so often in my naval career. And that is the need for planning and the need for being sure that all elements of that plan are covered by adequate provision in regard to personnel, material, and equipment. No military operation can be successful without well thought out plans. And no operation as extensive as this civil defense movement can proceed without well thought out plans. I know enough about the developments in the civil defense field to know that those plans exist. They are perfect to a meticulous degree and cover all angles of possible disaster. They do emphasize possibly the atomic attack. But sometimes I wonder if people realize the different forms of disaster that can overtake a community in what is known as unorthodox war. And I assure you that there are many forms of casualties and disaster that can take place when you consider the world as it now exists. civil defense. Therefore, the word civil defense, although it may be shaped up, to cover an atomic attack of one form or another, we must remember two things. One is that that atomic attack may not come by military means as we know them. The other thing is that there may be other unorthodox or unexpected forms of attack causing disaster of great proportion and an organization such as this is as well fitted to handle such forms of the unexpected as is it fitted and ready to accept the disaster of atomics. To be likely for a minute, it always reminds me of the time we were going into the coast of Japan. And we were going in there for the first time in force. and there was a very fine newspaper correspondent talking to me on the bread. And he said, Admiral, what are those submarines in there for in the coast? I said, they're to discover and let us know whether there are any mines in there or not. He said, what are those patrol planes out there for? I said, they're out there to prevent any high-speed motor torpedo boats from coming in at us at night. What are those planes overhead there in the distance? I said, they're to prevent the enemy from using their radar and discovering it. He said, what are those planes overhead for? I said, those are to prevent and knock down any Japanese air attack that may try to interfere with it. And so he pointed to a half a dozen additional things. And he got white. It was his first experience in the forward area. He said, Admiral, do you expect all these things to happen? I said, no, I don't expect any of them to happen. But he said, if we weren't ready for them, they might happen. And furthermore, if we weren't ready for them, the disaster of Congratulations these young ladies for the part that they are honored to take in leading the way toward the recruitment of volunteers for this worthy cause I think that the city of New York and the country at large is to be congratulated because of the example that these young ladies are setting for this great project which has so much assurance bound up in its planning and implementation and therefore to you young ladies the Navy through me extends their best wishes their appreciation God bless you thank you Admiral Badger may I present to you at this time the Director of Civil Defense the Honorable Arthur W. Wallander Mr. Chairman Mr. Mayor General Kittenberger Admiral Badger Mrs. Aldrich Dr. Kogel ladies and gentlemen and our very charming nurses aides I think that all that has been said by General Kittenberger and Admiral Badger leaves very little for me to say I would like to point out though that the frightful effects of the possible bombing by the new technique and and air attack certainly ought to bring about a realization the need for everybody doing a part in this here great emergency you all know the casualties that may result we shouldn't assume an attitude of frustration nor despair I think it's one of get up and fight because many lives can be saved if we follow the simple rules that have been laid down by the civil defense authorities you just this is everybody's fight that's just not yours nor mine but everybody within the listening range or within seeing range either here or elsewhere should certainly take heed your mayor has recognized this a long time ago and he's given us every assurance that whatever is necessary to carry on in a defense effort why he will back up the request I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the nation's aides who are assembled here and who are to be the interviewers and to recruit others I think it's a fine gesture and one that should bring good results from others they should follow your example and I do hope that you get very many volunteers because we need thousands of hands to do the thousands of jobs that we're going to have to do if disaster should strike this is a big job and I'm very happy to see you join up with us and I congratulate you and commend you on this fine effort thank you Mr. Mayor I present to you the first nurses who are prepared to number one listen to you for some advice and number two have you swear them in as the first nurses in the city of New York in civil defense Mr. Whelan Mr. Wallander Mrs. Aldridge General Quittenberger Admiral Badger my colleagues on the Board of Estimate the distinguished borough president of Manhattan Bob Wagner Jr. the acting president of the council the fellow who took over my job Joe Schocke ladies and gentlemen I purposely introduced Mr. Wagner and Mr. Schocke because in spite of what people think whenever appropriations come up for approval they're not measures that are passed upon by the mayor he's merely one member of the Board of Estimate these other gentlemen that I referred to Mr. Schocke Mr. Wagner controller the five borough presidents representing each borough of the city of New York are the gentlemen that make up the governing body of the city of New York so it's the cooperative effort of all the members of the Board that make appropriations available including appropriations for civil defense I'm very happy that they join with us today in these ceremonies General Krittenberger after the case that Admiral Batchier made out and bearing in mind that I'm a Navy man two I was wondering whether you wanted to amend your original statement hearing nothing I assume that the general will accept the amendment offered by Admiral Badger закон��� for the 1981 It's a great pleasure for me to be invited to participate with you this afternoon, particularly in the ceremony with reference to the administration of the loyalty oath. On a day such as today, which I think is probably one of the most miserable afternoons of the entire winter, it's certainly a great tribute to you ladies that you would take time out from what is undoubtedly a very busy schedule to come up here on your own time and to demonstrate your love for your city and your love for your country by attending this very inspiring ceremony this afternoon. I don't intend to go into a review of the necessity for what we're here to do today. I think that the elements behind it have been fully explained by Mrs. Aldrich, by Mr. Whelan, by Mr. Wallander, by General Crittenberger, by Admiral Badger. We merely want to point out that in approaching this problem of civil defense, we don't approach it at all with the idea of alarming the people of the city of New York. Just as Admiral Badger so eloquently pointed out, this is in the nature of preparation. We hope to God that the preparations that we make will never be at all necessary. But we don't want to be over-optimistic about it. So that in all the coverages that he told you about, perhaps not a single one of those preventive measures was ever necessary. But in the event of necessity, they are all available. And that's exactly the position of the city of New York, with reference to civil defense preparation. And although not too many of our people know it, we hope and pray that more of them will take a more active interest in it, just as you are doing this afternoon. But the fact of the matter is that we have been very actively engaged in preparing people to an attitude of mind where they will really start to do something about preparing the city of New York for a proper civil defense program. And to that end, we have been working a long time. This program has been underway well over six months. And I'm happy to tell you that I've attended a great number of conferences. And that while people might think that we haven't been doing enough, the fact of the matter is that your city leads the entire country. And I do not exclude any single city. We lead the entire country in taking the necessary steps to prepare your city for a possible emergency. To that end, we have secured the services of a gentleman that I think is the best qualified man in the entire city of New York to head up our civil defense program. He's a gentleman who came up through the ranks in the police department, eventually became the police commissioner of our city, and during World War II, headed up our civil defense unit in the city of New York. I'm happy to tell you that he's a volunteer, exactly as you are. He works at this job morning, noon, and night, works for you on a volunteer basis. Although he works full-time, he's still a volunteer serving without compensation. And I'd like to pay public tribute to Mr. Arthur Wallander. Thank you. See, everybody is working on this job on a volunteer basis. Mrs. Aldridge takes time out from her very busy schedule to devote a great deal of her time to spark-plugging this program, doing a perfectly wonderful job for the city that she loves so much. You take a fellow like Grover Whelan. Now, he's a busy man. When you don't see him at City Hall, when you don't see him bringing up the duchess of, well, I won't mention the particular duchess. But he's a very active citizen. He has a very, very responsible executive position with a very large firm. I'm not going to mention it today. Otherwise, I might be accused of doing a little indirect advertising. Whelan doesn't need that. But there were various facets of this campaign. Some of them, although we were working on them time and time again, some of them began to lag. Not through any fall of Arthur Wallander. Not through any fall of the mayor. Not through the fall of any of the people that are responsible for your city government. But the American public, as you know, sometimes require just a little something to get them alerted. Perhaps it's good that way. That's been our experience ever since we started off as a free nation. Just to give you one illustration. I can recall vividly the days of World War II. And even then, people were not too much excited. They're not excited today. That is, they're not excited enough. Korea is too far away from the American scene. And it really wasn't until Pearl Harbor that the American public really became aroused. And from that point on, we went full force ahead. Now, in this situation, we haven't had a Pearl Harbor. Thank God for that. But this situation that is not of our own creation needs something to arouse the American public. They have not been aroused sufficiently. Certainly on the national, the state, and the local level, those of us that are entrusted by you to serve you and serve your wishes, serve the form of government you want for yourselves and for your children, know something of what is going on. So much so that your national government, only within the last two weeks or three weeks, has already set up an appropriation of approximately $3 billion for civil defense. Your state government has taken cognizance of it. Your city government has a long time ago and has spent considerable money on it already. So that one of the things that was lagging was our recruitment drive, recruitment of volunteers. Of course we have a wonderful army, we have a wonderful Navy, we have a wonderful Air Force, but they are the leaders in certain fields. To back them up, we need a virile, healthy volunteer organization. So I want to thank Grover Whalen that when a lag occurred in our recruitment drive, he took off his coat, went to work, and as a result of it, in large part, I would say that we have this very fine turnout today. Grover, may I thank you for your civic-mindedness in taking over this job. That about sums it up. We appreciate your presence here today. We appreciate your interest. We'd like to have you arouse among your co-workers the same spirit that brought you here today. You know other nurses who haven't volunteered yet. You know nurses' aides who haven't volunteered yet. Each and every one of you ladies can become sales ladies overnight because certainly if you've been aroused to the point where you're willing to take time out to come here today, you've expressed a willingness to help your country. Helping your city is merely incidental because anything that affects the people of the city of New York, call it number one target, call it number ten target, doesn't mean a thing because whatever affects us affects the security of the entire country. so that if you will go out among your co-workers, you know who they are. There's a great number of nurses, trained, registered nurses, practical nurses, who perhaps today are not in the nursing profession that could be brought in. You know who they are. Tell them about this program and I'm certain that with your assistance, this particular phase of our program will go over the top. May I thank you sincerely for your presence here today. May I tell you that I know that I express the thanks and the appreciation of all the people of the city of New York whom I'm proud and happy to represent on this occasion and telling you that I'm positive that if all eight million were looking down upon you this afternoon, they would want me to say in their behalf, thank you ladies for your wonderful demonstration of real American womanhood. Now, will you repeat after me, please, and raise your right hands. I repeat your name. Do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic. that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same. That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same. That I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter. I am about to enter. And I do further swear or affirm that I do not advocate nor am I a member or an affiliate of any organization, group, or combination of persons that advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force or violence. And that during such time as I am a member of the Office of Civil Defense of the City of New York, I will not advocate nor become a member or an affiliate of any organization, group, or combination of persons that advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force or violence. Of the government of the United States by force or violence. Congratulations. You now are officially members of our family of the Office of Civil Defense. Mr. Mayor, the photographers would like to have you stand down front there. and I also say, Mr. Mayor, that you are expected and will be called upon to sign every one of these oaths. You may not have enough work to do, but I'm sure it would be a great treasure. Very happy to do that.
