The End The Christmas message of peace and goodwill always brings with it a warm sense of kinship with the people of other lands. Many of the carols which we all love are borrowed from other countries. Tonight, your city station brings you a group of musicians and carol singers from the Scandinavian Atlantic Avenue Corps of the Salvation Army who will offer tonight a transcribed program of Swedish and American Christmas songs and carols. The first of these is in English, written by one of the best-known and best-loved women of our time, General Evangeline Booth of the Salvation Army. It is called The Star in the East. The Star in the East. It's a song that broke over the island's hill The angels' song seeds on earth's goodwill And the song made all my world to thrill The lovely song of the star in me The star in the East. It's a song that broke over the island's hill And the earth keeps us back in the sky But the black in your crown, shining low on the hill, Send them high, giving praise from the stars. And the jokes will say when dark clouds are here, Crying messages come to someone, somewhere. For the stars could not do for any way, Work not for a cloud in the sky. There's a door in your own, that in praise and cross, In the woods and the bridge in the sea. Of the dead, munchy-torn, hear the host be born, And the deer through its wings and green. To rejoice, to others, our hearts was morn, The birds of peace with death grew in storm, But the song is the light of the rich that's born, But the song of the star is the king. The English translation of the title of the next song is The Glistening Christmas Tree. We invite you to listen now as the Salvation Army Scandinavian Chorus, accompanied by the string band, sing the Swedish version. Ghost in mind The Hells työwek The seven геро Nyzer The nine persone The 11 foursted sa The new children Wolystано Of the wood The 139 Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh This carol too is in Swedish but with a title that will sound familiar to everyone. The Scandinavian chorus accompanying themselves on their stringed instruments sing, Come let us go to Bethlehem. In the Urim's love, the very strange voice, In the Urim's love, the folk will share a song, Here is in the sense, Let's listen to me somehow, And in the rest, The form goes by Let's listen to them And in the meantime, Okay , going on with the end of the day Kind of thing it might happen, About the chop m here, All righted by the Most aktivist of the fact. Come on the small, come on the small, come on the small, till death's end. Sing loud and hear, the gifts and cheers the hay. Sing the pure, for soon the days will break. Come see and make, our fondly seal for yours. The water's day, the promise of the storm. Come on the small, till death's end, the air. And there will be the prince of the rain. Come on the small, come on the small, come on the small, till death's end. Come on the small, the air are now in the small. Till bread and snow, the angels you're on the small. There are no big proud, the justice we've ever. Till Jesus' name, for there's no chair of stand. Come on the small, till death's end, the air. And there will be the prince of the air. Come on the small, come on the small, come on the small, till death's end. And now, while the Salvation Army string band and chorus pause for a moment, I have the pleasure of introducing Major Olaf Lundgren of the Salvation Army. Major Lundgren. Thank you, Mr. Enloe. The musicians you are hearing this evening are American salvationists of Scandinavian birth or Scandinavian descent. At this time of year, we turn lovingly to the customs of the old country, partly for ourselves and our children, but perhaps even more for the hundreds of guests who have come to us at Christmas time. Every evening during the holidays, they come to attend our services, to march with us, singing around the Christmas trees, to drink our good strong coffee and eat our Swedish Christmas cakes. Most of them are seamen from the great ships that travel back and forth across the Atlantic. Sometimes, when one of the largest ships is in New York, three or four hundred of its crew are our guests. I know that with us they feel less homesick and lonely in a foreign port at Christmas time. The Salvation Army has many guests at Christmas and throughout the year. Children, old people, the homeless wanderers in the barry, the men who find temporary shelter and employment in our social centers, the women in our maternity home, our hotels and emergency lodges. To them, and to you, who are listening, the Salvation Army sends a hearty wish for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Thank you very much, Major Lundgren. You'll be listening to Major Olaf Lundgren of the Salvation Army, who is here with the Army's Scandinavian string band and chorus.

There is one Christmas carol that seems to belong to every country in the world, one that is known and loved by all. Listen as the choristers sing Silent Night. Holy smile, holy pride, Round yon virgin, mother and child, Holy is with no tender and mild, Sleep in heavenly peace, Sleep in heavenly peace. Silent night, holy night, Shepherds sway at the sky, Glories sing from heaven afar, Heavenly homes sing Alleluia, Christ the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born. Silent night, holy night, Son of God, love to rise, Radiant sheets from thy holy face, With the joy of the redeeming grace, Jesus Lord as I am, Jesus Lord as I am. As a finale this evening, the Salvation Army string band and chorus will play and sing a triumphant Swedish Christmas hymn, He Has Come. Those are the weights of the upgrades acabone album.
